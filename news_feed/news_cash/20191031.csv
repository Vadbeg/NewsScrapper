She climbed Everest nine times and set a world record – so why doesn’t she have sponsors?,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 02:00:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/she-climbed-everest-nine-times-060021913.html,"Lhakpa Sherpa works for minimum wages and currently washes dishes, as she trains for her 10th Everest summit with no endorsement deals, no nutritionist and no trainerLhakpa Sherpa in Talcott Mountain state park in Simsbury, Connecticut, where she hikes to prepare for her 10th summit of Everest in the spring of 2020. Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The GuardianI reach Lhakpa Sherpa’s West Hartford apartment at noon on an overcast Sunday in Connecticut. She bounds out of the front door, embraces me, and welcomes me inside. The small apartment is dimly lit. The living room has a few chairs, and a wall of sports medals from her two daughters’ 5Ks and gymnastic meets.Lhakpa was the first Nepalese woman to summit Everest and descend alive, which she accomplished in the spring of 2000. With nine summits, she holds the world record for women. She plans to summit the world’s highest mountain again in the spring of 2020, but as an unsponsored athlete and single mother of three, it’s difficult to afford training and travel. She currently works at Whole Foods washing dishes, making minimum wage. Unable to afford or drive a car, she walks to work and occasionally takes an Uber to training destinations.Sitting in her living room, I’m struck by her achievements – but also her lack of resources. How is it that a woman with such demonstrated accomplishment and skill is without sponsorship, and must risk nearly everything to continue to climb the Himalayan mountains she loves?Lhakpa makes tea while I chat with her 13-year-old daughter, Shiny, who – more fluent in technology and the English language – acts as her mother’s manager and occasional translator.“What’s it like for you,” I ask, “when your mother is away on an expedition?”> I want to show the world I can do it. I want to show women who look like me that they can do it, too.She turns her phone over in her hands. “It’s hard,” she says. “I’m proud of her, but I worry.” Each climbing season, six to 10 climbers die on the mountain.Everest expeditions last upwards of two months, usually in May, and there are only occasional opportunities to communicate via satellite phone and Skype. Avalanches, like the one that hit base camp in 2015, have kept them out of contact for weeks at a time.“I’m very good with the mountain,” Lhakpa says, bringing me a hot cup of tea, offering her warm smile. She has a long, lush ponytail and bright eyes. “I go, but I know I will come home. I have to come home.” She looks reassuringly at Shiny.Lhakpa, 45, grew up in Balakharka, a village in the Makalu region of the Nepalese Himalayas, where her father owned tea houses, and her mother still lives. Lhakpa tells me she isn’t sure of her exact age, as there were no birth certificates, and all of her mother’s 11 children were born at home. As a child, Lhakpa had no electricity, and young girls did not attend school.Lhapka Sherpa prepares tea at her home in West Hartford. Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The Guardian“You see my family on television,” she says. “Sherpas. Climbing Everest.” Her brother Mingma Gelu Sherpa directs an expedition outfitter in Kathmandu. Her oldest brother has summited “10 or 11 times,” she says. Another brother has summited eight times, her youngest brother five, and a sister has summited once.“If there weren’t any Sherpas,” she tells me, “nobody could climb Everest”.She worries when people say that anyone can climb Everest if they have the money – she’s heard people say that it’s just a matter of putting one foot in front of the other, and that Sherpas will do all the work. An average climb with a western outfitter costs upwards of $50,000, while a Nepalese outfitter costs upwards of $30,000.She has seen firsthand all the ways people can die on Everest: avalanches, falls, the thin air of the dead zone. Climbers must occasionally pass bodies, of which there are over a 100 on the mountain. (Bodies are dangerous to take down and doing so requires the effort of at least five sherpas.) Sherpas pass through the Khumbu icefall roughly 40 times just to make sure tourists have the supplies and ropes they need. If you spend enough time in the icefall, she says, you are guaranteed to die.“Why do we do this job?” she asks. “Because the alternative is to make money growing potatoes.”For Lhakpa, to say climbing Everest is easy is an insult. The fact that it is said at all reveals the problematic ways privilege has woven itself into adventure culture.Lhakpa Sherpa and her daughter Shiny, who says of her mother: ‘I’m proud of her, but I worry.’ Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The Guardian•••Serena Williams won the Australian Open while 23 weeks pregnant; Lhakpa Sherpa summited Everest eight months after the birth of her first child, and again while two months pregnant with Shiny.But unlike Williams, Lhakpa has no endorsement deals, no nutritionist, no trainer. She can’t afford to train full time, or much at all, because she works constantly in order to pay her rent.When she leaves her hourly jobs for climbing expeditions, she risks homelessness. When she returns, she picks up as much work as she can, working as a cashier at 7-Eleven and cleaning houses. “I never tell them about Everest,” she says, recounting a time when an employer realized that the woman mopping his floor was a world-renowned athlete.When I approached her for an interview, I asked her if we could hike together. As we prepare to leave for the walk, I notice that the grommet on Lhakpa’s hiking boots is broken, and she struggles to lace them. I’ve seen athletes with lesser accomplishments – but a higher number of Instagram followers – receive impressive amounts of free gear. Lhakpa mentions that her worn, orange Osprey backpack has summited Everest at least twice.Lhakpa Sherpa in 2006, when she broke her own record for the most Everest summits by a woman. Photograph: Prakash Mathema/AFP/GettyIn an era where many organizations profess a desire to diversify outdoors culture, it is difficult to process that such an accomplished athlete – with an authentic connection to the place she climbs - remains unsupported. I presume the root cause is that Lhakpa is not traditionally marketable, and brands want maximum visibility. She doesn’t have a curated Instagram presence. She’s a middle-aged woman of color, an immigrant single mother who speaks in broken English. She doesn’t exude “stoke”. She’s known to climb slowly on the lower slopes, at the advice of the Icefall Doctors, the Sherpas who manage the ropes and ladders over deep crevasses.In person, Lhakpa’s words are laced with intelligence and humor, and her passion for climbing is evident. “This is my gift,” she says of climbing. Though she would have liked to become a doctor or pilot in another life, she knows her talent is getting herself and others on top of some of the world’s largest peaks. Though Black Diamond sponsored an earlier climb, Lhakpa is currently without support.Her dream is to summit Everest in May 2020, followed by K2, a mountain whose summit once eluded her because of inclement weather. She knows this plan is ambitious, if not crazy. “All extreme athletes are crazy,” she says. “But I want to show the world I can do it. I want to show women who look like me that they can do it, too.”•••We take an easy hike on Talcott Mountain, a place she often goes with friends for a quick walk. She occasionally stops to place her hand on a rock face. We talk about the sounds of Everest, particularly the groaning ice. She shows me how she sleeps in a tent on the coldest nights, with her hands clasped underneath her body in the sleeping bag.Lhakpa began climbing in the same way many of her siblings and cousins did, helping an uncle move equipment for tourists on Makalu at 15, serving as a kitchen hand and porter. She says she was a tomboy, and that her mother worried she would never get married. She met her first husband on the mountain, and they moved to the United States in 2002. They often climbed together, until the relationship turned violent.> Climbing is my way out of washing dishes. It is the way to make a better life for the girlsIn 2004, her husband notoriously struck her on Everest, continuing a pattern of abuse that began upon the birth of their first child and continued on expeditions and at home. A difficult few years followed, with the family’s fortunes falling; by 2012 they were on food stamps. After further attacks, hospitalizations, and a stay at a shelter, the couple divorced, and Lhakpa was awarded full custody of the girls.I first learned about Lhakpa years ago, through the story of the 2004 climb, and have thought several times how damaging to her climbing career it must have been. She was forced to endure physical and emotional hardship in front of her professional community, and did not have the ability to control the public narrative. She left her marriage with no financial resources and two dependents. (Her oldest child, Nima, a son from another relationship, is now an adult.) She undoubtedly lost good climbing years to adversity, and yet her commitment to climbing persists.It has always seemed unfair to me to ask female athletes and artists about their marriage and children. Were the “great” male explorers of the past – or even the present – asked as often about how their children are cared for during an adventure, or if it’s OK to take certain risks – but to leave Lhakpa’s marriage and children out of the picture would perhaps be to hide one of her greatest challenges, and most profound motivations.“Climbing is my way out of washing dishes,” Lhakpa tells me. “It is the way to make a better life for the girls.”•••Lhakpa Sherpa: ‘If you don’t trust, you die.’ Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The GuardianAs we walk the well-worn paths of Talcott Mountain back to my car, Shiny becomes concerned about mosquitoes. “I don’t want you to get EEE when you’re out hiking,” she tells Lhakpa. I think about how difficult it must be to process the risks her mother takes, all while knowing her lifetime record of resilient comebacks. They look out for each other. Even when Lhakpa is posing for photographs at an outlook, she has one eye on her youngest daughter, and cautions her against stepping too close to the ridge line.Lhakpa and I talk about the difference between climbing Everest as a Sherpa, and as a climber. One you do for someone else, and the other you do for yourself. She expresses a moving amount of devotion to the clients Sherpas guide to the summit.“You make a promise,” she says, “and you keep it.” Lhakpa talks a lot about trust – trusting herself, trusting the climbing partner she’s tethered to, trusting the mountain. “If you don’t trust,” she says, “you die.”“I’m a small mouse climbing a big mountain,” Lhakpa tells me. Her relationship with the mountain is reverent, as if she’s in conversation with it. “Share with the mountain,” she says. “If you’re scared, your fear scares the mountain.” She even delayed 2019’s planned climb because of her beloved father’s death. “I didn’t want to carry the sadness,” she says. “It would not be safe.”When we get back to the apartment, Lhakpa shows me her boots and insulated Red Fox suit. “I look like a bear,” she says, slipping into the gear, which is reminiscent of a wearable sleeping bag. During climbing season, the temperatures on Everest’s summit range from -4F to -31F.Lhakpa displays the 50-year-old oxygen mask she wears because she says it’s more reliable than the new ones. Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The GuardianShe also wears a 50-year-old oxygen mask, because she believes it’s more reliable than the new ones. “I need smart students,” she says, asking me if I can find someone to design a better mask based on the old models. I picture a group of bright minds at MIT listening to this woman – this expert – who has grown up on the mountain and knows what climbers need as they step into the thin air of Everest.These are the other things Lhakpa wants: sponsorship for her historic 10th climb. Time to train and build her guiding business, Cloudscape Climbing. A life spent on the mountains and not cleaning dishes and taking out trash. A book and documentary about her life. Money to help send her bright daughters to college.“These are not quick dreams,” she adds. “They are long dreams.”Lhakpa has always worked hard to survive, and to subvert expectations. In the past, people have discounted the summits of Sherpas, saying that their familiarity with the altitude and location somehow diminishes the accomplishment. Lhakpa, who dared to step outside of a service culture and climb for herself, wants a 10th summit, and is serious about advancing her record.When I ask Shiny what she admires most about her mother, she pauses. “There is so much,” she says, her voice shaking. “But I would have to say her confidence.”Lhakpa is self-conscious of her hands, dried from washing dishes, and the jobs she must work in order to support her family. She is also driven to inspire others, particularly women and single parents. “I would like to hide in the mountain,” Lhakpa confesses on our descent, aware of her humble circumstances. “But I have to show my face here.”",http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aTsrZU.6T7nrIx0cghr9Rw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/924e3a16db3b93dd3a85bbed5207015e,She climbed Everest nine times and set a world record – so why doesn’t she have sponsors?

Authorities Identify ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe’ Through DNA and Now the Real Questions Start,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:13:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/authorities-identify-fly-creek-jane-131307745.html,"On a chilly February Sunday in 1980, a father and son panning for gold along Fly Creek in Clark County, Washington, kicked up the remains of a human skeleton that appeared to have been buried in a shallow grave. They called the authorities who came to collect the skull and what bones hadn’t been dragged away by animals, and were able to use the remains to construct a facial reconstruction that produced a picture of a teenage girl. Detectives were able to deduce that she died from a cause that did not seem natural. Calls for information, searches through missing persons reports, and detective work turned up nothing. No one seemed to miss the teen, dubbed the ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe,’ and, for the last 40 years, that is as far as the case went–until now.This summer Clark County detectives decided to post a DNA sample from the old remains to the Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, a public genealogy database that has had recent success closing old cold cases. The lab found a tie to a distant cousin of a teen named Sandra “Sandy” Renee Morden who said she was last seen in 1977–three years before her skeletal remains were found. Courtesy of Clark County SheriffThe Oregonian then dug up an old birthday announcement that was tied to the case. On April 29, 1977, in the classified section of the paper, a tiny ad appeared that said: “Sandra Renee Morden, Happy 15th Birthday. Love Always—Mom.” Such published greetings were a common way to mark a birthday or anniversary in the era before Facebook and other social media. Morden’s parents were divorced, according to the DNA-linked cousin, who does not want to be named and who provided Clark County cold-case detective Lindsay Schultz with the only clues the teen’s life. Schultz told the Oregonian that Morden was a “latchkey kid” who was mostly “unsupervised.” There is no indication that the parents filed a missing persons report, and, as Schultz says, “We didn’t have [the National Crime Information Center] at that time.” The detective says Morden’s parents came from the San Francisco area and settled in Portland. They split up in the early 1970s, and did not communicate with each other. The girl’s mother, identified as Kathryn Irene Morden, apparently lost custody and the cousin said Sandy most often stayed with her father, identified as Andrew Bain Morden, a Marine Corps veteran who fought in the Korean War. Schultz says she likely fell through the cracks when one parent thought the other had her. She last attended Wilson High School in Portland. Schultz told the Oregonian that the father likely thought she was with her mother. He had left her alone for an extended period of time and when he came back, she was gone, so he assumed she had gone to her mother’s home. “We don’t know for certain,” Schultz says. “We know that’s what family members believe.”Both parents are dead, so there is no way to confirm what either of them knew. Schultz told the Oregonian that it is the birthday greeting that bothers him most. It was posted around the time the extended family says she disappeared. “Was it just a mom who loved her daughter–or did her mom know something and put it out there for that reason?” Schultz said. “It’s one of those two, right? You ponder it. You look at it and you think, ‘What does it mean?’”Now detectives are looking for the missing puzzle pieces. They are calling on anyone who might have any information about Morden, her parents, or how she might have died to contact the Clark County Medical Examiner's Office or Clark County Sheriff's Office Cold Case Tip Line.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Sign up here. India’s farmers’ organizations have planned a nationwide protest on Nov. 4 to demand that the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi keep agriculture out of a 16-nation trade agreement currently being negotiated in Thailand.The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, an umbrella organization of about 250 farmers unions from across the country, said that they will burn effigies depicting the China-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership or RCEP, to mark their protest and warn the government.Indian farmers won’t be able to compete should the country agree to cut duties for agricultural and dairy products in the proposed trade pact, said V.M. Singh, a convener of the the farmers’ group. Imports of dairy and agricultural products including wheat, cotton and oil seeds would affect the livelihood of millions of Indian farmers, he said.The government should defer signing of the agreement and hold consultations with farmers, state governments and other stake holders before taking a final decision, said Singh. “We have to stop RCEP,” he said.It is not clear yet what terms India will agree to in order to join what could become the world’s largest trade deal. The final stage of negotiations have begun in Bangkok and Indian trade minister Piyush Goyal will travel for the ministerial meeting there on Nov. 1.

The Supreme Court Should Kill DACA,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 06:30:31 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/supreme-court-end-daca-103031297.html,"President Obama created an illegal policy for the executive branch to follow. President Trump decided to stop that policy. And in a bizarre case the Supreme Court will be hearing November 12, activist groups are suing to force the executive branch to keep acting illegally.At the heart of the case is the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, through which Obama made legal status and work authorization available to more than a million illegal-immigrant “Dreamers” who arrived in this country as minors. Trump decided to end the program and was, unsurprisingly, promptly sued.If the year were 2016 and the lawsuit were about whether the Court itself should strike down DACA — instead of whether it should stop the executive from ending it — you could at least have a sliver of a debate. Federal immigration laws do grant the executive branch broad enforcement discretion, and the executive branch has used deferred action, albeit on a much narrower basis, to avoid deporting sensitive groups in the past.However, even in that hypothetical case, the program would not have much of a chance before a conservative Court. A similar program for the illegal-immigrant parents of citizen children (“DAPA”) was enjoined in court and never implemented, and the appeals-court ruling against the program spelled out an argument that would obviously apply to DACA as well.The appeals court pointed out that, as vague as U.S. immigration laws can be, they lay out an elaborate process for granting legal status to immigrants. In lieu of that system, the Obama administration’s interpretation of the law would allow the executive “to grant lawful presence and work authorization to any illegal alien in the United States — an untenable position in light of the [law’s] intricate system of immigration classifications and employment eligibility.”The court also stressed that “previous deferred-action programs are not analogous to DAPA.” They were typically used to help people from a specific country in the wake of a disaster, or to help immigrants move from one legal status to another.The Supreme Court confronted the DAPA case in the wake of Antonin Scalia’s death, split 4–4, and thereby let the appeals-court ruling be the final word. The Court has moved to the right since then, so the four votes supporting the appeals-court ruling likely represent the views of the new five-justice conservative majority.And there’s a big difference between the old DAPA case and the new DACA one: In the previous case, the courts were asked to stop the executive branch from acting illegally, raising the age-old quandary of how aggressive the judicial branch should be when it comes to reining in the abuses of the executive. This time, the courts are asked to refuse to let the executive branch end the illegal program on its own, on the idea that the administration failed to adequately explain and defend its reasons for doing so. Such i-dotting and t-crossing is required under the Administrative Procedures Act.As Josh Blackman and Ilya Shapiro — who both support DACA as a policy — explained in a recent brief for the Cato Institute, the argument just doesn’t hold water. Even if the short letter laying out the administration’s objections wasn’t a “model of clarity,” it explained that DACA lacked “proper statutory authority” and suffered from the same problems that had gotten DAPA killed in court on “multiple legal grounds.” The letter also alluded to a deeper constitutional problem: If current immigration law does allow the executive branch to change policy so drastically on its own, it’s arguably an illegal delegation of Congress’s lawmaking power, and the executive branch can and should avoid this problem by winding down the policy.But most to the point, Blackman and Shapiro write that “the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) cannot be read to force the executive branch to continue implementing a policy that is contrary to law, regardless of how it chooses to rescind the policy.”Something like DACA will almost certainly be part of any long-term compromise on immigration policy. I’m sure most congressional Republicans would be happy to preserve it in exchange for a smarter immigration system. But the executive had no right to enact DACA on its own, and the courts have no right to stop the Trump administration from correcting course.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Zo3439T_YD9HcnTVxOQcbw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/99f778b59c4318e137b1700d28478d94,The Supreme Court Should Kill DACA

She climbed Everest nine times and set a world record – so why doesn’t she have sponsors?,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 02:00:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/she-climbed-everest-nine-times-060021913.html,"Lhakpa Sherpa works for minimum wages and currently washes dishes, as she trains for her 10th Everest summit with no endorsement deals, no nutritionist and no trainerLhakpa Sherpa in Talcott Mountain state park in Simsbury, Connecticut, where she hikes to prepare for her 10th summit of Everest in the spring of 2020. Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The GuardianI reach Lhakpa Sherpa’s West Hartford apartment at noon on an overcast Sunday in Connecticut. She bounds out of the front door, embraces me, and welcomes me inside. The small apartment is dimly lit. The living room has a few chairs, and a wall of sports medals from her two daughters’ 5Ks and gymnastic meets.Lhakpa was the first Nepalese woman to summit Everest and descend alive, which she accomplished in the spring of 2000. With nine summits, she holds the world record for women. She plans to summit the world’s highest mountain again in the spring of 2020, but as an unsponsored athlete and single mother of three, it’s difficult to afford training and travel. She currently works at Whole Foods washing dishes, making minimum wage. Unable to afford or drive a car, she walks to work and occasionally takes an Uber to training destinations.Sitting in her living room, I’m struck by her achievements – but also her lack of resources. How is it that a woman with such demonstrated accomplishment and skill is without sponsorship, and must risk nearly everything to continue to climb the Himalayan mountains she loves?Lhakpa makes tea while I chat with her 13-year-old daughter, Shiny, who – more fluent in technology and the English language – acts as her mother’s manager and occasional translator.“What’s it like for you,” I ask, “when your mother is away on an expedition?”> I want to show the world I can do it. I want to show women who look like me that they can do it, too.She turns her phone over in her hands. “It’s hard,” she says. “I’m proud of her, but I worry.” Each climbing season, six to 10 climbers die on the mountain.Everest expeditions last upwards of two months, usually in May, and there are only occasional opportunities to communicate via satellite phone and Skype. Avalanches, like the one that hit base camp in 2015, have kept them out of contact for weeks at a time.“I’m very good with the mountain,” Lhakpa says, bringing me a hot cup of tea, offering her warm smile. She has a long, lush ponytail and bright eyes. “I go, but I know I will come home. I have to come home.” She looks reassuringly at Shiny.Lhakpa, 45, grew up in Balakharka, a village in the Makalu region of the Nepalese Himalayas, where her father owned tea houses, and her mother still lives. Lhakpa tells me she isn’t sure of her exact age, as there were no birth certificates, and all of her mother’s 11 children were born at home. As a child, Lhakpa had no electricity, and young girls did not attend school.Lhapka Sherpa prepares tea at her home in West Hartford. Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The Guardian“You see my family on television,” she says. “Sherpas. Climbing Everest.” Her brother Mingma Gelu Sherpa directs an expedition outfitter in Kathmandu. Her oldest brother has summited “10 or 11 times,” she says. Another brother has summited eight times, her youngest brother five, and a sister has summited once.“If there weren’t any Sherpas,” she tells me, “nobody could climb Everest”.She worries when people say that anyone can climb Everest if they have the money – she’s heard people say that it’s just a matter of putting one foot in front of the other, and that Sherpas will do all the work. An average climb with a western outfitter costs upwards of $50,000, while a Nepalese outfitter costs upwards of $30,000.She has seen firsthand all the ways people can die on Everest: avalanches, falls, the thin air of the dead zone. Climbers must occasionally pass bodies, of which there are over a 100 on the mountain. (Bodies are dangerous to take down and doing so requires the effort of at least five sherpas.) Sherpas pass through the Khumbu icefall roughly 40 times just to make sure tourists have the supplies and ropes they need. If you spend enough time in the icefall, she says, you are guaranteed to die.“Why do we do this job?” she asks. “Because the alternative is to make money growing potatoes.”For Lhakpa, to say climbing Everest is easy is an insult. The fact that it is said at all reveals the problematic ways privilege has woven itself into adventure culture.Lhakpa Sherpa and her daughter Shiny, who says of her mother: ‘I’m proud of her, but I worry.’ Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The Guardian•••Serena Williams won the Australian Open while 23 weeks pregnant; Lhakpa Sherpa summited Everest eight months after the birth of her first child, and again while two months pregnant with Shiny.But unlike Williams, Lhakpa has no endorsement deals, no nutritionist, no trainer. She can’t afford to train full time, or much at all, because she works constantly in order to pay her rent.When she leaves her hourly jobs for climbing expeditions, she risks homelessness. When she returns, she picks up as much work as she can, working as a cashier at 7-Eleven and cleaning houses. “I never tell them about Everest,” she says, recounting a time when an employer realized that the woman mopping his floor was a world-renowned athlete.When I approached her for an interview, I asked her if we could hike together. As we prepare to leave for the walk, I notice that the grommet on Lhakpa’s hiking boots is broken, and she struggles to lace them. I’ve seen athletes with lesser accomplishments – but a higher number of Instagram followers – receive impressive amounts of free gear. Lhakpa mentions that her worn, orange Osprey backpack has summited Everest at least twice.Lhakpa Sherpa in 2006, when she broke her own record for the most Everest summits by a woman. Photograph: Prakash Mathema/AFP/GettyIn an era where many organizations profess a desire to diversify outdoors culture, it is difficult to process that such an accomplished athlete – with an authentic connection to the place she climbs - remains unsupported. I presume the root cause is that Lhakpa is not traditionally marketable, and brands want maximum visibility. She doesn’t have a curated Instagram presence. She’s a middle-aged woman of color, an immigrant single mother who speaks in broken English. She doesn’t exude “stoke”. She’s known to climb slowly on the lower slopes, at the advice of the Icefall Doctors, the Sherpas who manage the ropes and ladders over deep crevasses.In person, Lhakpa’s words are laced with intelligence and humor, and her passion for climbing is evident. “This is my gift,” she says of climbing. Though she would have liked to become a doctor or pilot in another life, she knows her talent is getting herself and others on top of some of the world’s largest peaks. Though Black Diamond sponsored an earlier climb, Lhakpa is currently without support.Her dream is to summit Everest in May 2020, followed by K2, a mountain whose summit once eluded her because of inclement weather. She knows this plan is ambitious, if not crazy. “All extreme athletes are crazy,” she says. “But I want to show the world I can do it. I want to show women who look like me that they can do it, too.”•••We take an easy hike on Talcott Mountain, a place she often goes with friends for a quick walk. She occasionally stops to place her hand on a rock face. We talk about the sounds of Everest, particularly the groaning ice. She shows me how she sleeps in a tent on the coldest nights, with her hands clasped underneath her body in the sleeping bag.Lhakpa began climbing in the same way many of her siblings and cousins did, helping an uncle move equipment for tourists on Makalu at 15, serving as a kitchen hand and porter. She says she was a tomboy, and that her mother worried she would never get married. She met her first husband on the mountain, and they moved to the United States in 2002. They often climbed together, until the relationship turned violent.> Climbing is my way out of washing dishes. It is the way to make a better life for the girlsIn 2004, her husband notoriously struck her on Everest, continuing a pattern of abuse that began upon the birth of their first child and continued on expeditions and at home. A difficult few years followed, with the family’s fortunes falling; by 2012 they were on food stamps. After further attacks, hospitalizations, and a stay at a shelter, the couple divorced, and Lhakpa was awarded full custody of the girls.I first learned about Lhakpa years ago, through the story of the 2004 climb, and have thought several times how damaging to her climbing career it must have been. She was forced to endure physical and emotional hardship in front of her professional community, and did not have the ability to control the public narrative. She left her marriage with no financial resources and two dependents. (Her oldest child, Nima, a son from another relationship, is now an adult.) She undoubtedly lost good climbing years to adversity, and yet her commitment to climbing persists.It has always seemed unfair to me to ask female athletes and artists about their marriage and children. Were the “great” male explorers of the past – or even the present – asked as often about how their children are cared for during an adventure, or if it’s OK to take certain risks – but to leave Lhakpa’s marriage and children out of the picture would perhaps be to hide one of her greatest challenges, and most profound motivations.“Climbing is my way out of washing dishes,” Lhakpa tells me. “It is the way to make a better life for the girls.”•••Lhakpa Sherpa: ‘If you don’t trust, you die.’ Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The GuardianAs we walk the well-worn paths of Talcott Mountain back to my car, Shiny becomes concerned about mosquitoes. “I don’t want you to get EEE when you’re out hiking,” she tells Lhakpa. I think about how difficult it must be to process the risks her mother takes, all while knowing her lifetime record of resilient comebacks. They look out for each other. Even when Lhakpa is posing for photographs at an outlook, she has one eye on her youngest daughter, and cautions her against stepping too close to the ridge line.Lhakpa and I talk about the difference between climbing Everest as a Sherpa, and as a climber. One you do for someone else, and the other you do for yourself. She expresses a moving amount of devotion to the clients Sherpas guide to the summit.“You make a promise,” she says, “and you keep it.” Lhakpa talks a lot about trust – trusting herself, trusting the climbing partner she’s tethered to, trusting the mountain. “If you don’t trust,” she says, “you die.”“I’m a small mouse climbing a big mountain,” Lhakpa tells me. Her relationship with the mountain is reverent, as if she’s in conversation with it. “Share with the mountain,” she says. “If you’re scared, your fear scares the mountain.” She even delayed 2019’s planned climb because of her beloved father’s death. “I didn’t want to carry the sadness,” she says. “It would not be safe.”When we get back to the apartment, Lhakpa shows me her boots and insulated Red Fox suit. “I look like a bear,” she says, slipping into the gear, which is reminiscent of a wearable sleeping bag. During climbing season, the temperatures on Everest’s summit range from -4F to -31F.Lhakpa displays the 50-year-old oxygen mask she wears because she says it’s more reliable than the new ones. Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The GuardianShe also wears a 50-year-old oxygen mask, because she believes it’s more reliable than the new ones. “I need smart students,” she says, asking me if I can find someone to design a better mask based on the old models. I picture a group of bright minds at MIT listening to this woman – this expert – who has grown up on the mountain and knows what climbers need as they step into the thin air of Everest.These are the other things Lhakpa wants: sponsorship for her historic 10th climb. Time to train and build her guiding business, Cloudscape Climbing. A life spent on the mountains and not cleaning dishes and taking out trash. A book and documentary about her life. Money to help send her bright daughters to college.“These are not quick dreams,” she adds. “They are long dreams.”Lhakpa has always worked hard to survive, and to subvert expectations. In the past, people have discounted the summits of Sherpas, saying that their familiarity with the altitude and location somehow diminishes the accomplishment. Lhakpa, who dared to step outside of a service culture and climb for herself, wants a 10th summit, and is serious about advancing her record.When I ask Shiny what she admires most about her mother, she pauses. “There is so much,” she says, her voice shaking. “But I would have to say her confidence.”Lhakpa is self-conscious of her hands, dried from washing dishes, and the jobs she must work in order to support her family. She is also driven to inspire others, particularly women and single parents. “I would like to hide in the mountain,” Lhakpa confesses on our descent, aware of her humble circumstances. “But I have to show my face here.”",http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aTsrZU.6T7nrIx0cghr9Rw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/924e3a16db3b93dd3a85bbed5207015e,She climbed Everest nine times and set a world record – so why doesn’t she have sponsors?

Authorities Identify ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe’ Through DNA and Now the Real Questions Start,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:13:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/authorities-identify-fly-creek-jane-131307745.html,"On a chilly February Sunday in 1980, a father and son panning for gold along Fly Creek in Clark County, Washington, kicked up the remains of a human skeleton that appeared to have been buried in a shallow grave. They called the authorities who came to collect the skull and what bones hadn’t been dragged away by animals, and were able to use the remains to construct a facial reconstruction that produced a picture of a teenage girl. Detectives were able to deduce that she died from a cause that did not seem natural. Calls for information, searches through missing persons reports, and detective work turned up nothing. No one seemed to miss the teen, dubbed the ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe,’ and, for the last 40 years, that is as far as the case went–until now.This summer Clark County detectives decided to post a DNA sample from the old remains to the Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, a public genealogy database that has had recent success closing old cold cases. The lab found a tie to a distant cousin of a teen named Sandra “Sandy” Renee Morden who said she was last seen in 1977–three years before her skeletal remains were found. Courtesy of Clark County SheriffThe Oregonian then dug up an old birthday announcement that was tied to the case. On April 29, 1977, in the classified section of the paper, a tiny ad appeared that said: “Sandra Renee Morden, Happy 15th Birthday. Love Always—Mom.” Such published greetings were a common way to mark a birthday or anniversary in the era before Facebook and other social media. Morden’s parents were divorced, according to the DNA-linked cousin, who does not want to be named and who provided Clark County cold-case detective Lindsay Schultz with the only clues the teen’s life. Schultz told the Oregonian that Morden was a “latchkey kid” who was mostly “unsupervised.” There is no indication that the parents filed a missing persons report, and, as Schultz says, “We didn’t have [the National Crime Information Center] at that time.” The detective says Morden’s parents came from the San Francisco area and settled in Portland. They split up in the early 1970s, and did not communicate with each other. The girl’s mother, identified as Kathryn Irene Morden, apparently lost custody and the cousin said Sandy most often stayed with her father, identified as Andrew Bain Morden, a Marine Corps veteran who fought in the Korean War. Schultz says she likely fell through the cracks when one parent thought the other had her. She last attended Wilson High School in Portland. Schultz told the Oregonian that the father likely thought she was with her mother. He had left her alone for an extended period of time and when he came back, she was gone, so he assumed she had gone to her mother’s home. “We don’t know for certain,” Schultz says. “We know that’s what family members believe.”Both parents are dead, so there is no way to confirm what either of them knew. Schultz told the Oregonian that it is the birthday greeting that bothers him most. It was posted around the time the extended family says she disappeared. “Was it just a mom who loved her daughter–or did her mom know something and put it out there for that reason?” Schultz said. “It’s one of those two, right? You ponder it. You look at it and you think, ‘What does it mean?’”Now detectives are looking for the missing puzzle pieces. They are calling on anyone who might have any information about Morden, her parents, or how she might have died to contact the Clark County Medical Examiner's Office or Clark County Sheriff's Office Cold Case Tip Line.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Sign up here. India’s farmers’ organizations have planned a nationwide protest on Nov. 4 to demand that the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi keep agriculture out of a 16-nation trade agreement currently being negotiated in Thailand.The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, an umbrella organization of about 250 farmers unions from across the country, said that they will burn effigies depicting the China-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership or RCEP, to mark their protest and warn the government.Indian farmers won’t be able to compete should the country agree to cut duties for agricultural and dairy products in the proposed trade pact, said V.M. Singh, a convener of the the farmers’ group. Imports of dairy and agricultural products including wheat, cotton and oil seeds would affect the livelihood of millions of Indian farmers, he said.The government should defer signing of the agreement and hold consultations with farmers, state governments and other stake holders before taking a final decision, said Singh. “We have to stop RCEP,” he said.It is not clear yet what terms India will agree to in order to join what could become the world’s largest trade deal. The final stage of negotiations have begun in Bangkok and Indian trade minister Piyush Goyal will travel for the ministerial meeting there on Nov. 1.

The Supreme Court Should Kill DACA,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 06:30:31 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/supreme-court-end-daca-103031297.html,"President Obama created an illegal policy for the executive branch to follow. President Trump decided to stop that policy. And in a bizarre case the Supreme Court will be hearing November 12, activist groups are suing to force the executive branch to keep acting illegally.At the heart of the case is the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, through which Obama made legal status and work authorization available to more than a million illegal-immigrant “Dreamers” who arrived in this country as minors. Trump decided to end the program and was, unsurprisingly, promptly sued.If the year were 2016 and the lawsuit were about whether the Court itself should strike down DACA — instead of whether it should stop the executive from ending it — you could at least have a sliver of a debate. Federal immigration laws do grant the executive branch broad enforcement discretion, and the executive branch has used deferred action, albeit on a much narrower basis, to avoid deporting sensitive groups in the past.However, even in that hypothetical case, the program would not have much of a chance before a conservative Court. A similar program for the illegal-immigrant parents of citizen children (“DAPA”) was enjoined in court and never implemented, and the appeals-court ruling against the program spelled out an argument that would obviously apply to DACA as well.The appeals court pointed out that, as vague as U.S. immigration laws can be, they lay out an elaborate process for granting legal status to immigrants. In lieu of that system, the Obama administration’s interpretation of the law would allow the executive “to grant lawful presence and work authorization to any illegal alien in the United States — an untenable position in light of the [law’s] intricate system of immigration classifications and employment eligibility.”The court also stressed that “previous deferred-action programs are not analogous to DAPA.” They were typically used to help people from a specific country in the wake of a disaster, or to help immigrants move from one legal status to another.The Supreme Court confronted the DAPA case in the wake of Antonin Scalia’s death, split 4–4, and thereby let the appeals-court ruling be the final word. The Court has moved to the right since then, so the four votes supporting the appeals-court ruling likely represent the views of the new five-justice conservative majority.And there’s a big difference between the old DAPA case and the new DACA one: In the previous case, the courts were asked to stop the executive branch from acting illegally, raising the age-old quandary of how aggressive the judicial branch should be when it comes to reining in the abuses of the executive. This time, the courts are asked to refuse to let the executive branch end the illegal program on its own, on the idea that the administration failed to adequately explain and defend its reasons for doing so. Such i-dotting and t-crossing is required under the Administrative Procedures Act.As Josh Blackman and Ilya Shapiro — who both support DACA as a policy — explained in a recent brief for the Cato Institute, the argument just doesn’t hold water. Even if the short letter laying out the administration’s objections wasn’t a “model of clarity,” it explained that DACA lacked “proper statutory authority” and suffered from the same problems that had gotten DAPA killed in court on “multiple legal grounds.” The letter also alluded to a deeper constitutional problem: If current immigration law does allow the executive branch to change policy so drastically on its own, it’s arguably an illegal delegation of Congress’s lawmaking power, and the executive branch can and should avoid this problem by winding down the policy.But most to the point, Blackman and Shapiro write that “the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) cannot be read to force the executive branch to continue implementing a policy that is contrary to law, regardless of how it chooses to rescind the policy.”Something like DACA will almost certainly be part of any long-term compromise on immigration policy. I’m sure most congressional Republicans would be happy to preserve it in exchange for a smarter immigration system. But the executive had no right to enact DACA on its own, and the courts have no right to stop the Trump administration from correcting course.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Zo3439T_YD9HcnTVxOQcbw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/99f778b59c4318e137b1700d28478d94,The Supreme Court Should Kill DACA

She bounds out of the front door, embraces me, and welcomes me inside. The small apartment is dimly lit.

I want to show women who look like me that they can do it, too.She turns her phone over in her hands. “It’s hard,” she says. “I’m proud of her, but I worry.” Each climbing season, six to 10 climbers die on the mountain.Everest expeditions last upwards of two months, usually in May, and there are only occasional opportunities to communicate via satellite phone and Skype. Avalanches, like the one that hit base camp in 2015, have kept them out of contact for weeks at a time.“I’m very good with the mountain,” Lhakpa says, bringing me a hot cup of tea, offering her warm smile. She has a long, lush ponytail and bright eyes. “I go, but I know I will come home. I have to come home.” She looks reassuringly at Shiny.Lhakpa, 45, grew up in Balakharka, a village in the Makalu region of the Nepalese Himalayas, where her father owned tea houses, and her mother still lives. Lhakpa tells me she isn’t sure of her exact age, as there were no birth certificates, and all of her mother’s 11 children were born at home. As a child, Lhakpa had no electricity, and young girls did not attend school.Lhapka Sherpa prepares tea at her home in West Hartford. Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The Guardian“You see my family on television,” she says. “Sherpas. Climbing Everest.” Her brother Mingma Gelu Sherpa directs an expedition outfitter in Kathmandu. Her oldest brother has summited “10 or 11 times,” she says. Another brother has summited eight times, her youngest brother five, and a sister has summited once.“If there weren’t any Sherpas,” she tells me, “nobody could climb Everest”.She worries when people say that anyone can climb Everest if they have the money – she’s heard people say that it’s just a matter of putting one foot in front of the other, and that Sherpas will do all the work. An average climb with a western outfitter costs upwards of $50,000, while a Nepalese outfitter costs upwards of $30,000.She has seen firsthand all the ways people can die on Everest: avalanches, falls, the thin air of the dead zone. Climbers must occasionally pass bodies, of which there are over a 100 on the mountain. (Bodies are dangerous to take down and doing so requires the effort of at least five sherpas.) Sherpas pass through the Khumbu icefall roughly 40 times just to make sure tourists have the supplies and ropes they need. If you spend enough time in the icefall, she says, you are guaranteed to die.“Why do we do this job?” she asks. “Because the alternative is to make money growing potatoes.”For Lhakpa, to say climbing Everest is easy is an insult. The fact that it is said at all reveals the problematic ways privilege has woven itself into adventure culture.Lhakpa Sherpa and her daughter Shiny, who says of her mother: ‘I’m proud of her, but I worry.’ Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The Guardian•••Serena Williams won the Australian Open while 23 weeks pregnant; Lhakpa Sherpa summited Everest eight months after the birth of her first child, and again while two months pregnant with Shiny.But unlike Williams, Lhakpa has no endorsement deals, no nutritionist, no trainer. She can’t afford to train full time, or much at all, because she works constantly in order to pay her rent.When she leaves her hourly jobs for climbing expeditions, she risks homelessness. When she returns, she picks up as much work as she can, working as a cashier at 7-Eleven and cleaning houses. “I never tell them about Everest,” she says, recounting a time when an employer realized that the woman mopping his floor was a world-renowned athlete.When I approached her for an interview, I asked her if we could hike together. As we prepare to leave for the walk, I notice that the grommet on Lhakpa’s hiking boots is broken, and she struggles to lace them. I’ve seen athletes with lesser accomplishments – but a higher number of Instagram followers – receive impressive amounts of free gear. Lhakpa mentions that her worn, orange Osprey backpack has summited Everest at least twice.Lhakpa Sherpa in 2006, when she broke her own record for the most Everest summits by a woman. Photograph: Prakash Mathema/AFP/GettyIn an era where many organizations profess a desire to diversify outdoors culture, it is difficult to process that such an accomplished athlete – with an authentic connection to the place she climbs - remains unsupported. I presume the root cause is that Lhakpa is not traditionally marketable, and brands want maximum visibility. She doesn’t have a curated Instagram presence. She’s a middle-aged woman of color, an immigrant single mother who speaks in broken English. She doesn’t exude “stoke”. She’s known to climb slowly on the lower slopes, at the advice of the Icefall Doctors, the Sherpas who manage the ropes and ladders over deep crevasses.In person, Lhakpa’s words are laced with intelligence and humor, and her passion for climbing is evident. “This is my gift,” she says of climbing. Though she would have liked to become a doctor or pilot in another life, she knows her talent is getting herself and others on top of some of the world’s largest peaks. Though Black Diamond sponsored an earlier climb, Lhakpa is currently without support.Her dream is to summit Everest in May 2020, followed by K2, a mountain whose summit once eluded her because of inclement weather. She knows this plan is ambitious, if not crazy. “All extreme athletes are crazy,” she says. “But I want to show the world I can do it. I want to show women who look like me that they can do it, too.”•••We take an easy hike on Talcott Mountain, a place she often goes with friends for a quick walk. She occasionally stops to place her hand on a rock face. We talk about the sounds of Everest, particularly the groaning ice. She shows me how she sleeps in a tent on the coldest nights, with her hands clasped underneath her body in the sleeping bag.Lhakpa began climbing in the same way many of her siblings and cousins did, helping an uncle move equipment for tourists on Makalu at 15, serving as a kitchen hand and porter. She says she was a tomboy, and that her mother worried she would never get married. She met her first husband on the mountain, and they moved to the United States in 2002. They often climbed together, until the relationship turned violent.> Climbing is my way out of washing dishes. It is the way to make a better life for the girlsIn 2004, her husband notoriously struck her on Everest, continuing a pattern of abuse that began upon the birth of their first child and continued on expeditions and at home. A difficult few years followed, with the family’s fortunes falling; by 2012 they were on food stamps. After further attacks, hospitalizations, and a stay at a shelter, the couple divorced, and Lhakpa was awarded full custody of the girls.I first learned about Lhakpa years ago, through the story of the 2004 climb, and have thought several times how damaging to her climbing career it must have been. She was forced to endure physical and emotional hardship in front of her professional community, and did not have the ability to control the public narrative. She left her marriage with no financial resources and two dependents. (Her oldest child, Nima, a son from another relationship, is now an adult.) She undoubtedly lost good climbing years to adversity, and yet her commitment to climbing persists.It has always seemed unfair to me to ask female athletes and artists about their marriage and children. Were the “great” male explorers of the past – or even the present – asked as often about how their children are cared for during an adventure, or if it’s OK to take certain risks – but to leave Lhakpa’s marriage and children out of the picture would perhaps be to hide one of her greatest challenges, and most profound motivations.“Climbing is my way out of washing dishes,” Lhakpa tells me. “It is the way to make a better life for the girls.”•••Lhakpa Sherpa: ‘If you don’t trust, you die.’ Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The GuardianAs we walk the well-worn paths of Talcott Mountain back to my car, Shiny becomes concerned about mosquitoes. “I don’t want you to get EEE when you’re out hiking,” she tells Lhakpa. I think about how difficult it must be to process the risks her mother takes, all while knowing her lifetime record of resilient comebacks. They look out for each other. Even when Lhakpa is posing for photographs at an outlook, she has one eye on her youngest daughter, and cautions her against stepping too close to the ridge line.Lhakpa and I talk about the difference between climbing Everest as a Sherpa, and as a climber. One you do for someone else, and the other you do for yourself. She expresses a moving amount of devotion to the clients Sherpas guide to the summit.“You make a promise,” she says, “and you keep it.” Lhakpa talks a lot about trust – trusting herself, trusting the climbing partner she’s tethered to, trusting the mountain. “If you don’t trust,” she says, “you die.”“I’m a small mouse climbing a big mountain,” Lhakpa tells me. Her relationship with the mountain is reverent, as if she’s in conversation with it. “Share with the mountain,” she says. “If you’re scared, your fear scares the mountain.” She even delayed 2019’s planned climb because of her beloved father’s death. “I didn’t want to carry the sadness,” she says. “It would not be safe.”When we get back to the apartment, Lhakpa shows me her boots and insulated Red Fox suit. “I look like a bear,” she says, slipping into the gear, which is reminiscent of a wearable sleeping bag. During climbing season, the temperatures on Everest’s summit range from -4F to -31F.Lhakpa displays the 50-year-old oxygen mask she wears because she says it’s more reliable than the new ones. Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The GuardianShe also wears a 50-year-old oxygen mask, because she believes it’s more reliable than the new ones. “I need smart students,” she says, asking me if I can find someone to design a better mask based on the old models. I picture a group of bright minds at MIT listening to this woman – this expert – who has grown up on the mountain and knows what climbers need as they step into the thin air of Everest.These are the other things Lhakpa wants: sponsorship for her historic 10th climb. Time to train and build her guiding business, Cloudscape Climbing. A life spent on the mountains and not cleaning dishes and taking out trash. A book and documentary about her life. Money to help send her bright daughters to college.“These are not quick dreams,” she adds. “They are long dreams.”Lhakpa has always worked hard to survive, and to subvert expectations. In the past, people have discounted the summits of Sherpas, saying that their familiarity with the altitude and location somehow diminishes the accomplishment. Lhakpa, who dared to step outside of a service culture and climb for herself, wants a 10th summit, and is serious about advancing her record.When I ask Shiny what she admires most about her mother, she pauses. “There is so much,” she says, her voice shaking. “But I would have to say her confidence.”Lhakpa is self-conscious of her hands, dried from washing dishes, and the jobs she must work in order to support her family. She is also driven to inspire others, particularly women and single parents. “I would like to hide in the mountain,” Lhakpa confesses on our descent, aware of her humble circumstances. “But I have to show my face here.”",http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aTsrZU.6T7nrIx0cghr9Rw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/924e3a16db3b93dd3a85bbed5207015e,She climbed Everest nine times and set a world record – so why doesn’t she have sponsors?

Authorities Identify ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe’ Through DNA and Now the Real Questions Start,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:13:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/authorities-identify-fly-creek-jane-131307745.html,"On a chilly February Sunday in 1980, a father and son panning for gold along Fly Creek in Clark County, Washington, kicked up the remains of a human skeleton that appeared to have been buried in a shallow grave. They called the authorities who came to collect the skull and what bones hadn’t been dragged away by animals, and were able to use the remains to construct a facial reconstruction that produced a picture of a teenage girl. Detectives were able to deduce that she died from a cause that did not seem natural. Calls for information, searches through missing persons reports, and detective work turned up nothing. No one seemed to miss the teen, dubbed the ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe,’ and, for the last 40 years, that is as far as the case went–until now.This summer Clark County detectives decided to post a DNA sample from the old remains to the Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, a public genealogy database that has had recent success closing old cold cases. The lab found a tie to a distant cousin of a teen named Sandra “Sandy” Renee Morden who said she was last seen in 1977–three years before her skeletal remains were found. Courtesy of Clark County SheriffThe Oregonian then dug up an old birthday announcement that was tied to the case. On April 29, 1977, in the classified section of the paper, a tiny ad appeared that said: “Sandra Renee Morden, Happy 15th Birthday. Love Always—Mom.” Such published greetings were a common way to mark a birthday or anniversary in the era before Facebook and other social media. Morden’s parents were divorced, according to the DNA-linked cousin, who does not want to be named and who provided Clark County cold-case detective Lindsay Schultz with the only clues the teen’s life. Schultz told the Oregonian that Morden was a “latchkey kid” who was mostly “unsupervised.” There is no indication that the parents filed a missing persons report, and, as Schultz says, “We didn’t have [the National Crime Information Center] at that time.” The detective says Morden’s parents came from the San Francisco area and settled in Portland. They split up in the early 1970s, and did not communicate with each other. The girl’s mother, identified as Kathryn Irene Morden, apparently lost custody and the cousin said Sandy most often stayed with her father, identified as Andrew Bain Morden, a Marine Corps veteran who fought in the Korean War. Schultz says she likely fell through the cracks when one parent thought the other had her. She last attended Wilson High School in Portland. Schultz told the Oregonian that the father likely thought she was with her mother. He had left her alone for an extended period of time and when he came back, she was gone, so he assumed she had gone to her mother’s home. “We don’t know for certain,” Schultz says. “We know that’s what family members believe.”Both parents are dead, so there is no way to confirm what either of them knew. Schultz told the Oregonian that it is the birthday greeting that bothers him most. It was posted around the time the extended family says she disappeared. “Was it just a mom who loved her daughter–or did her mom know something and put it out there for that reason?” Schultz said. “It’s one of those two, right? You ponder it. You look at it and you think, ‘What does it mean?’”Now detectives are looking for the missing puzzle pieces. They are calling on anyone who might have any information about Morden, her parents, or how she might have died to contact the Clark County Medical Examiner's Office or Clark County Sheriff's Office Cold Case Tip Line.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

India Farmers Plan Nationwide Protest Against 16-Nation Trade Deal,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 08:50:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/india-farmers-plan-nationwide-protest-125007797.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. India’s farmers’ organizations have planned a nationwide protest on Nov. 4 to demand that the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi keep agriculture out of a 16-nation trade agreement currently being negotiated in Thailand.The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, an umbrella organization of about 250 farmers unions from across the country, said that they will burn effigies depicting the China-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership or RCEP, to mark their protest and warn the government.Indian farmers won’t be able to compete should the country agree to cut duties for agricultural and dairy products in the proposed trade pact, said V.M. Singh, a convener of the the farmers’ group. Imports of dairy and agricultural products including wheat, cotton and oil seeds would affect the livelihood of millions of Indian farmers, he said.The government should defer signing of the agreement and hold consultations with farmers, state governments and other stake holders before taking a final decision, said Singh. “We have to stop RCEP,” he said.It is not clear yet what terms India will agree to in order to join what could become the world’s largest trade deal. The final stage of negotiations have begun in Bangkok and Indian trade minister Piyush Goyal will travel for the ministerial meeting there on Nov. 1. The nations are seeking to conclude the negotiations by November end.To contact the reporter on this story: Bibhudatta Pradhan in New Delhi at bpradhan@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ruth Pollard at rpollard2@bloomberg.net, Muneeza Naqvi, Abhay SinghFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GF2o4tZmPCtqpE8IuBOemg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/38b9b9b23d04b76ac5ea78347d209b84,India Farmers Plan Nationwide Protest Against 16-Nation Trade Deal

The Supreme Court Should Kill DACA,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 06:30:31 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/supreme-court-end-daca-103031297.html,"President Obama created an illegal policy for the executive branch to follow. President Trump decided to stop that policy. And in a bizarre case the Supreme Court will be hearing November 12, activist groups are suing to force the executive branch to keep acting illegally.At the heart of the case is the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, through which Obama made legal status and work authorization available to more than a million illegal-immigrant “Dreamers” who arrived in this country as minors. Trump decided to end the program and was, unsurprisingly, promptly sued.If the year were 2016 and the lawsuit were about whether the Court itself should strike down DACA — instead of whether it should stop the executive from ending it — you could at least have a sliver of a debate. Federal immigration laws do grant the executive branch broad enforcement discretion, and the executive branch has used deferred action, albeit on a much narrower basis, to avoid deporting sensitive groups in the past.However, even in that hypothetical case, the program would not have much of a chance before a conservative Court. A similar program for the illegal-immigrant parents of citizen children (“DAPA”) was enjoined in court and never implemented, and the appeals-court ruling against the program spelled out an argument that would obviously apply to DACA as well.The appeals court pointed out that, as vague as U.S. immigration laws can be, they lay out an elaborate process for granting legal status to immigrants. In lieu of that system, the Obama administration’s interpretation of the law would allow the executive “to grant lawful presence and work authorization to any illegal alien in the United States — an untenable position in light of the [law’s] intricate system of immigration classifications and employment eligibility.”The court also stressed that “previous deferred-action programs are not analogous to DAPA.” They were typically used to help people from a specific country in the wake of a disaster, or to help immigrants move from one legal status to another.The Supreme Court confronted the DAPA case in the wake of Antonin Scalia’s death, split 4–4, and thereby let the appeals-court ruling be the final word. The Court has moved to the right since then, so the four votes supporting the appeals-court ruling likely represent the views of the new five-justice conservative majority.And there’s a big difference between the old DAPA case and the new DACA one: In the previous case, the courts were asked to stop the executive branch from acting illegally, raising the age-old quandary of how aggressive the judicial branch should be when it comes to reining in the abuses of the executive. This time, the courts are asked to refuse to let the executive branch end the illegal program on its own, on the idea that the administration failed to adequately explain and defend its reasons for doing so. Such i-dotting and t-crossing is required under the Administrative Procedures Act.As Josh Blackman and Ilya Shapiro — who both support DACA as a policy — explained in a recent brief for the Cato Institute, the argument just doesn’t hold water. Even if the short letter laying out the administration’s objections wasn’t a “model of clarity,” it explained that DACA lacked “proper statutory authority” and suffered from the same problems that had gotten DAPA killed in court on “multiple legal grounds.” The letter also alluded to a deeper constitutional problem: If current immigration law does allow the executive branch to change policy so drastically on its own, it’s arguably an illegal delegation of Congress’s lawmaking power, and the executive branch can and should avoid this problem by winding down the policy.But most to the point, Blackman and Shapiro write that “the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) cannot be read to force the executive branch to continue implementing a policy that is contrary to law, regardless of how it chooses to rescind the policy.”Something like DACA will almost certainly be part of any long-term compromise on immigration policy.

Chris Christie Is Among Lawyers Reaping $15 Million in 1MDB Deal,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:33:49 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/chris-christie-among-lawyers-reaping-133349408.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest recovery ever from an American anti-corruption crackdown is proving lucrative for former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.A major deal struck by the U.S. for fugitive financier Jho Low to give up almost $1 billion in assets allegedly stolen from a Malaysian investment fund comes with a provision to pay his lawyers. As part of the 1MDB settlement, the Justice Department allowed for $15 million to be paid to a group advising Jho Low, including the law firm Christie set up after two terms as New Jersey’s governor.Those proceeds will come from Jho Low’s stake in EMI Music Publishing, which has grown to about $415 million. That investment ballooned after he initially put in a little more than $100 million stolen from 1MDB, according to prosecutors. The two sides agreed to the provision to allow the lawyers to extract fees from Low, whose assets and accounts have been seized or monitored by authorities across the world.“We were pleased to help negotiate this historic resolution in order to preserve the tremendous value of assets involved,” Christie said in a statement after the Justice Department announced the settlement agreement on Wednesday. It still needs approval from a federal judge.Christie, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 before dropping out and endorsing Donald Trump, set up his own law firm last year, the Christie Law Firm LLC. The other firms that will receive proceeds of the 1MDB deal for legal expenses are Kobre & Kim LLP and Lowenstein Sandler LLP.The agreement comes even before the criminal charges against Low have been resolved. In the settlement, the Justice Department cautioned that the released funds should be used only for the Low family’s legal fees and costs related to the lawsuits, and can’t be routed back to Low or his family.To contact the reporter on this story: Sridhar Natarajan in New York at snatarajan15@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

She climbed Everest nine times and set a world record – so why doesn’t she have sponsors?,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 02:00:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/she-climbed-everest-nine-times-060021913.html,"Lhakpa Sherpa works for minimum wages and currently washes dishes, as she trains for her 10th Everest summit with no endorsement deals, no nutritionist and no trainerLhakpa Sherpa in Talcott Mountain state park in Simsbury, Connecticut, where she hikes to prepare for her 10th summit of Everest in the spring of 2020. Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The GuardianI reach Lhakpa Sherpa’s West Hartford apartment at noon on an overcast Sunday in Connecticut. She bounds out of the front door, embraces me, and welcomes me inside. The small apartment is dimly lit. The living room has a few chairs, and a wall of sports medals from her two daughters’ 5Ks and gymnastic meets.Lhakpa was the first Nepalese woman to summit Everest and descend alive, which she accomplished in the spring of 2000. With nine summits, she holds the world record for women. She plans to summit the world’s highest mountain again in the spring of 2020, but as an unsponsored athlete and single mother of three, it’s difficult to afford training and travel. She currently works at Whole Foods washing dishes, making minimum wage. Unable to afford or drive a car, she walks to work and occasionally takes an Uber to training destinations.Sitting in her living room, I’m struck by her achievements – but also her lack of resources. How is it that a woman with such demonstrated accomplishment and skill is without sponsorship, and must risk nearly everything to continue to climb the Himalayan mountains she loves?Lhakpa makes tea while I chat with her 13-year-old daughter, Shiny, who – more fluent in technology and the English language – acts as her mother’s manager and occasional translator.“What’s it like for you,” I ask, “when your mother is away on an expedition?”> I want to show the world I can do it. I want to show women who look like me that they can do it, too.She turns her phone over in her hands. “It’s hard,” she says. “I’m proud of her, but I worry.” Each climbing season, six to 10 climbers die on the mountain.Everest expeditions last upwards of two months, usually in May, and there are only occasional opportunities to communicate via satellite phone and Skype. Avalanches, like the one that hit base camp in 2015, have kept them out of contact for weeks at a time.“I’m very good with the mountain,” Lhakpa says, bringing me a hot cup of tea, offering her warm smile. She has a long, lush ponytail and bright eyes. “I go, but I know I will come home. I have to come home.” She looks reassuringly at Shiny.Lhakpa, 45, grew up in Balakharka, a village in the Makalu region of the Nepalese Himalayas, where her father owned tea houses, and her mother still lives. Lhakpa tells me she isn’t sure of her exact age, as there were no birth certificates, and all of her mother’s 11 children were born at home. As a child, Lhakpa had no electricity, and young girls did not attend school.Lhapka Sherpa prepares tea at her home in West Hartford. Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The Guardian“You see my family on television,” she says. “Sherpas. Climbing Everest.” Her brother Mingma Gelu Sherpa directs an expedition outfitter in Kathmandu. Her oldest brother has summited “10 or 11 times,” she says. Another brother has summited eight times, her youngest brother five, and a sister has summited once.“If there weren’t any Sherpas,” she tells me, “nobody could climb Everest”.She worries when people say that anyone can climb Everest if they have the money – she’s heard people say that it’s just a matter of putting one foot in front of the other, and that Sherpas will do all the work. An average climb with a western outfitter costs upwards of $50,000, while a Nepalese outfitter costs upwards of $30,000.She has seen firsthand all the ways people can die on Everest: avalanches, falls, the thin air of the dead zone. Climbers must occasionally pass bodies, of which there are over a 100 on the mountain. (Bodies are dangerous to take down and doing so requires the effort of at least five sherpas.) Sherpas pass through the Khumbu icefall roughly 40 times just to make sure tourists have the supplies and ropes they need. If you spend enough time in the icefall, she says, you are guaranteed to die.“Why do we do this job?” she asks. “Because the alternative is to make money growing potatoes.”For Lhakpa, to say climbing Everest is easy is an insult. The fact that it is said at all reveals the problematic ways privilege has woven itself into adventure culture.Lhakpa Sherpa and her daughter Shiny, who says of her mother: ‘I’m proud of her, but I worry.’ Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The Guardian•••Serena Williams won the Australian Open while 23 weeks pregnant; Lhakpa Sherpa summited Everest eight months after the birth of her first child, and again while two months pregnant with Shiny.But unlike Williams, Lhakpa has no endorsement deals, no nutritionist, no trainer. She can’t afford to train full time, or much at all, because she works constantly in order to pay her rent.When she leaves her hourly jobs for climbing expeditions, she risks homelessness. When she returns, she picks up as much work as she can, working as a cashier at 7-Eleven and cleaning houses. “I never tell them about Everest,” she says, recounting a time when an employer realized that the woman mopping his floor was a world-renowned athlete.When I approached her for an interview, I asked her if we could hike together. As we prepare to leave for the walk, I notice that the grommet on Lhakpa’s hiking boots is broken, and she struggles to lace them. I’ve seen athletes with lesser accomplishments – but a higher number of Instagram followers – receive impressive amounts of free gear. Lhakpa mentions that her worn, orange Osprey backpack has summited Everest at least twice.Lhakpa Sherpa in 2006, when she broke her own record for the most Everest summits by a woman. Photograph: Prakash Mathema/AFP/GettyIn an era where many organizations profess a desire to diversify outdoors culture, it is difficult to process that such an accomplished athlete – with an authentic connection to the place she climbs - remains unsupported. I presume the root cause is that Lhakpa is not traditionally marketable, and brands want maximum visibility. She doesn’t have a curated Instagram presence. She’s a middle-aged woman of color, an immigrant single mother who speaks in broken English. She doesn’t exude “stoke”. She’s known to climb slowly on the lower slopes, at the advice of the Icefall Doctors, the Sherpas who manage the ropes and ladders over deep crevasses.In person, Lhakpa’s words are laced with intelligence and humor, and her passion for climbing is evident. “This is my gift,” she says of climbing. Though she would have liked to become a doctor or pilot in another life, she knows her talent is getting herself and others on top of some of the world’s largest peaks. Though Black Diamond sponsored an earlier climb, Lhakpa is currently without support.Her dream is to summit Everest in May 2020, followed by K2, a mountain whose summit once eluded her because of inclement weather. She knows this plan is ambitious, if not crazy. “All extreme athletes are crazy,” she says. “But I want to show the world I can do it. I want to show women who look like me that they can do it, too.”•••We take an easy hike on Talcott Mountain, a place she often goes with friends for a quick walk. She occasionally stops to place her hand on a rock face. We talk about the sounds of Everest, particularly the groaning ice. She shows me how she sleeps in a tent on the coldest nights, with her hands clasped underneath her body in the sleeping bag.Lhakpa began climbing in the same way many of her siblings and cousins did, helping an uncle move equipment for tourists on Makalu at 15, serving as a kitchen hand and porter. She says she was a tomboy, and that her mother worried she would never get married. She met her first husband on the mountain, and they moved to the United States in 2002. They often climbed together, until the relationship turned violent.> Climbing is my way out of washing dishes. It is the way to make a better life for the girlsIn 2004, her husband notoriously struck her on Everest, continuing a pattern of abuse that began upon the birth of their first child and continued on expeditions and at home. A difficult few years followed, with the family’s fortunes falling; by 2012 they were on food stamps. After further attacks, hospitalizations, and a stay at a shelter, the couple divorced, and Lhakpa was awarded full custody of the girls.I first learned about Lhakpa years ago, through the story of the 2004 climb, and have thought several times how damaging to her climbing career it must have been. She was forced to endure physical and emotional hardship in front of her professional community, and did not have the ability to control the public narrative. She left her marriage with no financial resources and two dependents. (Her oldest child, Nima, a son from another relationship, is now an adult.) She undoubtedly lost good climbing years to adversity, and yet her commitment to climbing persists.It has always seemed unfair to me to ask female athletes and artists about their marriage and children. Were the “great” male explorers of the past – or even the present – asked as often about how their children are cared for during an adventure, or if it’s OK to take certain risks – but to leave Lhakpa’s marriage and children out of the picture would perhaps be to hide one of her greatest challenges, and most profound motivations.“Climbing is my way out of washing dishes,” Lhakpa tells me. “It is the way to make a better life for the girls.”•••Lhakpa Sherpa: ‘If you don’t trust, you die.’ Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The GuardianAs we walk the well-worn paths of Talcott Mountain back to my car, Shiny becomes concerned about mosquitoes. “I don’t want you to get EEE when you’re out hiking,” she tells Lhakpa. I think about how difficult it must be to process the risks her mother takes, all while knowing her lifetime record of resilient comebacks. They look out for each other. Even when Lhakpa is posing for photographs at an outlook, she has one eye on her youngest daughter, and cautions her against stepping too close to the ridge line.Lhakpa and I talk about the difference between climbing Everest as a Sherpa, and as a climber. One you do for someone else, and the other you do for yourself. She expresses a moving amount of devotion to the clients Sherpas guide to the summit.“You make a promise,” she says, “and you keep it.” Lhakpa talks a lot about trust – trusting herself, trusting the climbing partner she’s tethered to, trusting the mountain. “If you don’t trust,” she says, “you die.”“I’m a small mouse climbing a big mountain,” Lhakpa tells me. Her relationship with the mountain is reverent, as if she’s in conversation with it. “Share with the mountain,” she says. “If you’re scared, your fear scares the mountain.” She even delayed 2019’s planned climb because of her beloved father’s death. “I didn’t want to carry the sadness,” she says. “It would not be safe.”When we get back to the apartment, Lhakpa shows me her boots and insulated Red Fox suit. “I look like a bear,” she says, slipping into the gear, which is reminiscent of a wearable sleeping bag. During climbing season, the temperatures on Everest’s summit range from -4F to -31F.Lhakpa displays the 50-year-old oxygen mask she wears because she says it’s more reliable than the new ones. Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The GuardianShe also wears a 50-year-old oxygen mask, because she believes it’s more reliable than the new ones. “I need smart students,” she says, asking me if I can find someone to design a better mask based on the old models. I picture a group of bright minds at MIT listening to this woman – this expert – who has grown up on the mountain and knows what climbers need as they step into the thin air of Everest.These are the other things Lhakpa wants: sponsorship for her historic 10th climb. Time to train and build her guiding business, Cloudscape Climbing. A life spent on the mountains and not cleaning dishes and taking out trash. A book and documentary about her life. Money to help send her bright daughters to college.“These are not quick dreams,” she adds. “They are long dreams.”Lhakpa has always worked hard to survive, and to subvert expectations. In the past, people have discounted the summits of Sherpas, saying that their familiarity with the altitude and location somehow diminishes the accomplishment. Lhakpa, who dared to step outside of a service culture and climb for herself, wants a 10th summit, and is serious about advancing her record.When I ask Shiny what she admires most about her mother, she pauses. “There is so much,” she says, her voice shaking. “But I would have to say her confidence.”Lhakpa is self-conscious of her hands, dried from washing dishes, and the jobs she must work in order to support her family. She is also driven to inspire others, particularly women and single parents. “I would like to hide in the mountain,” Lhakpa confesses on our descent, aware of her humble circumstances. “But I have to show my face here.”",http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aTsrZU.6T7nrIx0cghr9Rw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/924e3a16db3b93dd3a85bbed5207015e,She climbed Everest nine times and set a world record – so why doesn’t she have sponsors?

Authorities Identify ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe’ Through DNA and Now the Real Questions Start,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:13:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/authorities-identify-fly-creek-jane-131307745.html,"On a chilly February Sunday in 1980, a father and son panning for gold along Fly Creek in Clark County, Washington, kicked up the remains of a human skeleton that appeared to have been buried in a shallow grave. They called the authorities who came to collect the skull and what bones hadn’t been dragged away by animals, and were able to use the remains to construct a facial reconstruction that produced a picture of a teenage girl. Detectives were able to deduce that she died from a cause that did not seem natural. Calls for information, searches through missing persons reports, and detective work turned up nothing. No one seemed to miss the teen, dubbed the ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe,’ and, for the last 40 years, that is as far as the case went–until now.This summer Clark County detectives decided to post a DNA sample from the old remains to the Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, a public genealogy database that has had recent success closing old cold cases. The lab found a tie to a distant cousin of a teen named Sandra “Sandy” Renee Morden who said she was last seen in 1977–three years before her skeletal remains were found. Courtesy of Clark County SheriffThe Oregonian then dug up an old birthday announcement that was tied to the case. On April 29, 1977, in the classified section of the paper, a tiny ad appeared that said: “Sandra Renee Morden, Happy 15th Birthday. Love Always—Mom.” Such published greetings were a common way to mark a birthday or anniversary in the era before Facebook and other social media. Morden’s parents were divorced, according to the DNA-linked cousin, who does not want to be named and who provided Clark County cold-case detective Lindsay Schultz with the only clues the teen’s life. Schultz told the Oregonian that Morden was a “latchkey kid” who was mostly “unsupervised.” There is no indication that the parents filed a missing persons report, and, as Schultz says, “We didn’t have [the National Crime Information Center] at that time.” The detective says Morden’s parents came from the San Francisco area and settled in Portland. They split up in the early 1970s, and did not communicate with each other. The girl’s mother, identified as Kathryn Irene Morden, apparently lost custody and the cousin said Sandy most often stayed with her father, identified as Andrew Bain Morden, a Marine Corps veteran who fought in the Korean War. Schultz says she likely fell through the cracks when one parent thought the other had her. She last attended Wilson High School in Portland. Schultz told the Oregonian that the father likely thought she was with her mother. He had left her alone for an extended period of time and when he came back, she was gone, so he assumed she had gone to her mother’s home. “We don’t know for certain,” Schultz says. “We know that’s what family members believe.”Both parents are dead, so there is no way to confirm what either of them knew. Schultz told the Oregonian that it is the birthday greeting that bothers him most. It was posted around the time the extended family says she disappeared. “Was it just a mom who loved her daughter–or did her mom know something and put it out there for that reason?” Schultz said. “It’s one of those two, right? You ponder it. You look at it and you think, ‘What does it mean?’”Now detectives are looking for the missing puzzle pieces. They are calling on anyone who might have any information about Morden, her parents, or how she might have died to contact the Clark County Medical Examiner's Office or Clark County Sheriff's Office Cold Case Tip Line.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Singh, a convener of the the farmers’ group. Imports of dairy and agricultural products including wheat, cotton and oil seeds would affect the livelihood of millions of Indian farmers, he said.The government should defer signing of the agreement and hold consultations with farmers, state governments and other stake holders before taking a final decision, said Singh. “We have to stop RCEP,” he said.It is not clear yet what terms India will agree to in order to join what could become the world’s largest trade deal. The final stage of negotiations have begun in Bangkok and Indian trade minister Piyush Goyal will travel for the ministerial meeting there on Nov. 1. The nations are seeking to conclude the negotiations by November end.To contact the reporter on this story: Bibhudatta Pradhan in New Delhi at bpradhan@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ruth Pollard at rpollard2@bloomberg.net, Muneeza Naqvi, Abhay SinghFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GF2o4tZmPCtqpE8IuBOemg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/38b9b9b23d04b76ac5ea78347d209b84,India Farmers Plan Nationwide Protest Against 16-Nation Trade Deal

"KGB Judged ‘Comrade V.V. Putin’ a Disciplined, Conscientious Spy","Thu, 31 Oct 2019 06:46:29 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/kgb-judged-comrade-v-v-104629972.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin was “prompt, disciplined and conscientious” as a spy in the KGB, according to a declassified profile from the Soviet Union’s feared security service.“Comrade V.V. Putin constantly improves his ideological and political standards,” according to the document exhibited at the Central State Archive for Historical-Political Documents of St. Petersburg, the Russian leader’s home city. “He’s actively engaged in party education work.”The profile, which is also on show at a Moscow exhibition of “outstanding figures” of modern Russian history, describes Putin as “morally upstanding” and enjoying “well-deserved authority among colleagues,” noting that he won a judo championship in 1978.Putin joined the KGB in 1975 after graduating from the law faculty of Leningrad State University, located in what’s now St. Petersburg, and served as a spy for more than 15 years until the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991. Putin asked to become a KGB officer even before he finished school, according to his Kremlin biography, which cites him saying his view of the organization “was based on idealistic stories I heard about intelligence.”He served in Dresden in East Germany from 1985 until 1990, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel during a largely undistinguished stint, and was awarded a bronze medal for service to the National People’s Army of the German Democratic Republic. He headed the Federal Security Service, the main successor agency of the KGB, in 1998-1999 before President Boris Yeltsin made him prime minister and named Putin as his chosen successor. Putin was elected president in 2000.The KGB’s appraisal of Putin, which appears to be from the late 1970s or early 1980s, was absolutely standard and showed that he hadn’t stood out or achieved anything in particular, according to Alexei Kondaurov, a former KGB general. “Usually we wrote ‘morally upstanding’ when there was nothing else to say,” he said.Still, there’s been “colossal” public interest in the document, shown as part of commemorations of the archive’s 90th anniversary, said Olga Bobrova, deputy head of the institution.To contact the reporters on this story: Irina Reznik in Moscow at ireznik@bloomberg.net;Henry Meyer in Moscow at hmeyer4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Gregory L.

Chris Christie Is Among Lawyers Reaping $15 Million in 1MDB Deal,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:33:49 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/chris-christie-among-lawyers-reaping-133349408.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest recovery ever from an American anti-corruption crackdown is proving lucrative for former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.A major deal struck by the U.S. for fugitive financier Jho Low to give up almost $1 billion in assets allegedly stolen from a Malaysian investment fund comes with a provision to pay his lawyers. As part of the 1MDB settlement, the Justice Department allowed for $15 million to be paid to a group advising Jho Low, including the law firm Christie set up after two terms as New Jersey’s governor.Those proceeds will come from Jho Low’s stake in EMI Music Publishing, which has grown to about $415 million. That investment ballooned after he initially put in a little more than $100 million stolen from 1MDB, according to prosecutors. The two sides agreed to the provision to allow the lawyers to extract fees from Low, whose assets and accounts have been seized or monitored by authorities across the world.“We were pleased to help negotiate this historic resolution in order to preserve the tremendous value of assets involved,” Christie said in a statement after the Justice Department announced the settlement agreement on Wednesday. It still needs approval from a federal judge.Christie, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 before dropping out and endorsing Donald Trump, set up his own law firm last year, the Christie Law Firm LLC. The other firms that will receive proceeds of the 1MDB deal for legal expenses are Kobre & Kim LLP and Lowenstein Sandler LLP.The agreement comes even before the criminal charges against Low have been resolved. In the settlement, the Justice Department cautioned that the released funds should be used only for the Low family’s legal fees and costs related to the lawsuits, and can’t be routed back to Low or his family.To contact the reporter on this story: Sridhar Natarajan in New York at snatarajan15@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

She climbed Everest nine times and set a world record – so why doesn’t she have sponsors?,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 02:00:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/she-climbed-everest-nine-times-060021913.html,"Lhakpa Sherpa works for minimum wages and currently washes dishes, as she trains for her 10th Everest summit with no endorsement deals, no nutritionist and no trainerLhakpa Sherpa in Talcott Mountain state park in Simsbury, Connecticut, where she hikes to prepare for her 10th summit of Everest in the spring of 2020. Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The GuardianI reach Lhakpa Sherpa’s West Hartford apartment at noon on an overcast Sunday in Connecticut. She bounds out of the front door, embraces me, and welcomes me inside. The small apartment is dimly lit. The living room has a few chairs, and a wall of sports medals from her two daughters’ 5Ks and gymnastic meets.Lhakpa was the first Nepalese woman to summit Everest and descend alive, which she accomplished in the spring of 2000. With nine summits, she holds the world record for women. She plans to summit the world’s highest mountain again in the spring of 2020, but as an unsponsored athlete and single mother of three, it’s difficult to afford training and travel. She currently works at Whole Foods washing dishes, making minimum wage. Unable to afford or drive a car, she walks to work and occasionally takes an Uber to training destinations.Sitting in her living room, I’m struck by her achievements – but also her lack of resources. How is it that a woman with such demonstrated accomplishment and skill is without sponsorship, and must risk nearly everything to continue to climb the Himalayan mountains she loves?Lhakpa makes tea while I chat with her 13-year-old daughter, Shiny, who – more fluent in technology and the English language – acts as her mother’s manager and occasional translator.“What’s it like for you,” I ask, “when your mother is away on an expedition?”> I want to show the world I can do it. I want to show women who look like me that they can do it, too.She turns her phone over in her hands. “It’s hard,” she says. “I’m proud of her, but I worry.” Each climbing season, six to 10 climbers die on the mountain.Everest expeditions last upwards of two months, usually in May, and there are only occasional opportunities to communicate via satellite phone and Skype. Avalanches, like the one that hit base camp in 2015, have kept them out of contact for weeks at a time.“I’m very good with the mountain,” Lhakpa says, bringing me a hot cup of tea, offering her warm smile. She has a long, lush ponytail and bright eyes. “I go, but I know I will come home. I have to come home.” She looks reassuringly at Shiny.Lhakpa, 45, grew up in Balakharka, a village in the Makalu region of the Nepalese Himalayas, where her father owned tea houses, and her mother still lives. Lhakpa tells me she isn’t sure of her exact age, as there were no birth certificates, and all of her mother’s 11 children were born at home. As a child, Lhakpa had no electricity, and young girls did not attend school.Lhapka Sherpa prepares tea at her home in West Hartford. Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The Guardian“You see my family on television,” she says. “Sherpas. Climbing Everest.” Her brother Mingma Gelu Sherpa directs an expedition outfitter in Kathmandu. Her oldest brother has summited “10 or 11 times,” she says. Another brother has summited eight times, her youngest brother five, and a sister has summited once.“If there weren’t any Sherpas,” she tells me, “nobody could climb Everest”.She worries when people say that anyone can climb Everest if they have the money – she’s heard people say that it’s just a matter of putting one foot in front of the other, and that Sherpas will do all the work. An average climb with a western outfitter costs upwards of $50,000, while a Nepalese outfitter costs upwards of $30,000.She has seen firsthand all the ways people can die on Everest: avalanches, falls, the thin air of the dead zone. Climbers must occasionally pass bodies, of which there are over a 100 on the mountain. (Bodies are dangerous to take down and doing so requires the effort of at least five sherpas.) Sherpas pass through the Khumbu icefall roughly 40 times just to make sure tourists have the supplies and ropes they need. If you spend enough time in the icefall, she says, you are guaranteed to die.“Why do we do this job?” she asks. “Because the alternative is to make money growing potatoes.”For Lhakpa, to say climbing Everest is easy is an insult. The fact that it is said at all reveals the problematic ways privilege has woven itself into adventure culture.Lhakpa Sherpa and her daughter Shiny, who says of her mother: ‘I’m proud of her, but I worry.’ Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The Guardian•••Serena Williams won the Australian Open while 23 weeks pregnant; Lhakpa Sherpa summited Everest eight months after the birth of her first child, and again while two months pregnant with Shiny.But unlike Williams, Lhakpa has no endorsement deals, no nutritionist, no trainer. She can’t afford to train full time, or much at all, because she works constantly in order to pay her rent.When she leaves her hourly jobs for climbing expeditions, she risks homelessness. When she returns, she picks up as much work as she can, working as a cashier at 7-Eleven and cleaning houses. “I never tell them about Everest,” she says, recounting a time when an employer realized that the woman mopping his floor was a world-renowned athlete.When I approached her for an interview, I asked her if we could hike together. As we prepare to leave for the walk, I notice that the grommet on Lhakpa’s hiking boots is broken, and she struggles to lace them. I’ve seen athletes with lesser accomplishments – but a higher number of Instagram followers – receive impressive amounts of free gear. Lhakpa mentions that her worn, orange Osprey backpack has summited Everest at least twice.Lhakpa Sherpa in 2006, when she broke her own record for the most Everest summits by a woman. Photograph: Prakash Mathema/AFP/GettyIn an era where many organizations profess a desire to diversify outdoors culture, it is difficult to process that such an accomplished athlete – with an authentic connection to the place she climbs - remains unsupported. I presume the root cause is that Lhakpa is not traditionally marketable, and brands want maximum visibility. She doesn’t have a curated Instagram presence. She’s a middle-aged woman of color, an immigrant single mother who speaks in broken English. She doesn’t exude “stoke”. She’s known to climb slowly on the lower slopes, at the advice of the Icefall Doctors, the Sherpas who manage the ropes and ladders over deep crevasses.In person, Lhakpa’s words are laced with intelligence and humor, and her passion for climbing is evident. “This is my gift,” she says of climbing. Though she would have liked to become a doctor or pilot in another life, she knows her talent is getting herself and others on top of some of the world’s largest peaks. Though Black Diamond sponsored an earlier climb, Lhakpa is currently without support.Her dream is to summit Everest in May 2020, followed by K2, a mountain whose summit once eluded her because of inclement weather. She knows this plan is ambitious, if not crazy. “All extreme athletes are crazy,” she says. “But I want to show the world I can do it. I want to show women who look like me that they can do it, too.”•••We take an easy hike on Talcott Mountain, a place she often goes with friends for a quick walk. She occasionally stops to place her hand on a rock face. We talk about the sounds of Everest, particularly the groaning ice. She shows me how she sleeps in a tent on the coldest nights, with her hands clasped underneath her body in the sleeping bag.Lhakpa began climbing in the same way many of her siblings and cousins did, helping an uncle move equipment for tourists on Makalu at 15, serving as a kitchen hand and porter. She says she was a tomboy, and that her mother worried she would never get married. She met her first husband on the mountain, and they moved to the United States in 2002. They often climbed together, until the relationship turned violent.> Climbing is my way out of washing dishes. It is the way to make a better life for the girlsIn 2004, her husband notoriously struck her on Everest, continuing a pattern of abuse that began upon the birth of their first child and continued on expeditions and at home. A difficult few years followed, with the family’s fortunes falling; by 2012 they were on food stamps. After further attacks, hospitalizations, and a stay at a shelter, the couple divorced, and Lhakpa was awarded full custody of the girls.I first learned about Lhakpa years ago, through the story of the 2004 climb, and have thought several times how damaging to her climbing career it must have been. She was forced to endure physical and emotional hardship in front of her professional community, and did not have the ability to control the public narrative. She left her marriage with no financial resources and two dependents. (Her oldest child, Nima, a son from another relationship, is now an adult.) She undoubtedly lost good climbing years to adversity, and yet her commitment to climbing persists.It has always seemed unfair to me to ask female athletes and artists about their marriage and children. Were the “great” male explorers of the past – or even the present – asked as often about how their children are cared for during an adventure, or if it’s OK to take certain risks – but to leave Lhakpa’s marriage and children out of the picture would perhaps be to hide one of her greatest challenges, and most profound motivations.“Climbing is my way out of washing dishes,” Lhakpa tells me. “It is the way to make a better life for the girls.”•••Lhakpa Sherpa: ‘If you don’t trust, you die.’ Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The GuardianAs we walk the well-worn paths of Talcott Mountain back to my car, Shiny becomes concerned about mosquitoes. “I don’t want you to get EEE when you’re out hiking,” she tells Lhakpa. I think about how difficult it must be to process the risks her mother takes, all while knowing her lifetime record of resilient comebacks. They look out for each other. Even when Lhakpa is posing for photographs at an outlook, she has one eye on her youngest daughter, and cautions her against stepping too close to the ridge line.Lhakpa and I talk about the difference between climbing Everest as a Sherpa, and as a climber. One you do for someone else, and the other you do for yourself. She expresses a moving amount of devotion to the clients Sherpas guide to the summit.“You make a promise,” she says, “and you keep it.” Lhakpa talks a lot about trust – trusting herself, trusting the climbing partner she’s tethered to, trusting the mountain. “If you don’t trust,” she says, “you die.”“I’m a small mouse climbing a big mountain,” Lhakpa tells me. Her relationship with the mountain is reverent, as if she’s in conversation with it. “Share with the mountain,” she says. “If you’re scared, your fear scares the mountain.” She even delayed 2019’s planned climb because of her beloved father’s death. “I didn’t want to carry the sadness,” she says. “It would not be safe.”When we get back to the apartment, Lhakpa shows me her boots and insulated Red Fox suit. “I look like a bear,” she says, slipping into the gear, which is reminiscent of a wearable sleeping bag. During climbing season, the temperatures on Everest’s summit range from -4F to -31F.Lhakpa displays the 50-year-old oxygen mask she wears because she says it’s more reliable than the new ones. Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The GuardianShe also wears a 50-year-old oxygen mask, because she believes it’s more reliable than the new ones. “I need smart students,” she says, asking me if I can find someone to design a better mask based on the old models. I picture a group of bright minds at MIT listening to this woman – this expert – who has grown up on the mountain and knows what climbers need as they step into the thin air of Everest.These are the other things Lhakpa wants: sponsorship for her historic 10th climb. Time to train and build her guiding business, Cloudscape Climbing. A life spent on the mountains and not cleaning dishes and taking out trash. A book and documentary about her life. Money to help send her bright daughters to college.“These are not quick dreams,” she adds. “They are long dreams.”Lhakpa has always worked hard to survive, and to subvert expectations. In the past, people have discounted the summits of Sherpas, saying that their familiarity with the altitude and location somehow diminishes the accomplishment. Lhakpa, who dared to step outside of a service culture and climb for herself, wants a 10th summit, and is serious about advancing her record.When I ask Shiny what she admires most about her mother, she pauses. “There is so much,” she says, her voice shaking. “But I would have to say her confidence.”Lhakpa is self-conscious of her hands, dried from washing dishes, and the jobs she must work in order to support her family. She is also driven to inspire others, particularly women and single parents. “I would like to hide in the mountain,” Lhakpa confesses on our descent, aware of her humble circumstances. “But I have to show my face here.”",http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aTsrZU.6T7nrIx0cghr9Rw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/924e3a16db3b93dd3a85bbed5207015e,She climbed Everest nine times and set a world record – so why doesn’t she have sponsors?

Authorities Identify ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe’ Through DNA and Now the Real Questions Start,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:13:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/authorities-identify-fly-creek-jane-131307745.html,"On a chilly February Sunday in 1980, a father and son panning for gold along Fly Creek in Clark County, Washington, kicked up the remains of a human skeleton that appeared to have been buried in a shallow grave. They called the authorities who came to collect the skull and what bones hadn’t been dragged away by animals, and were able to use the remains to construct a facial reconstruction that produced a picture of a teenage girl. Detectives were able to deduce that she died from a cause that did not seem natural. Calls for information, searches through missing persons reports, and detective work turned up nothing. No one seemed to miss the teen, dubbed the ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe,’ and, for the last 40 years, that is as far as the case went–until now.This summer Clark County detectives decided to post a DNA sample from the old remains to the Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, a public genealogy database that has had recent success closing old cold cases. The lab found a tie to a distant cousin of a teen named Sandra “Sandy” Renee Morden who said she was last seen in 1977–three years before her skeletal remains were found. Courtesy of Clark County SheriffThe Oregonian then dug up an old birthday announcement that was tied to the case. On April 29, 1977, in the classified section of the paper, a tiny ad appeared that said: “Sandra Renee Morden, Happy 15th Birthday. Love Always—Mom.” Such published greetings were a common way to mark a birthday or anniversary in the era before Facebook and other social media. Morden’s parents were divorced, according to the DNA-linked cousin, who does not want to be named and who provided Clark County cold-case detective Lindsay Schultz with the only clues the teen’s life. Schultz told the Oregonian that Morden was a “latchkey kid” who was mostly “unsupervised.” There is no indication that the parents filed a missing persons report, and, as Schultz says, “We didn’t have [the National Crime Information Center] at that time.” The detective says Morden’s parents came from the San Francisco area and settled in Portland. They split up in the early 1970s, and did not communicate with each other. The girl’s mother, identified as Kathryn Irene Morden, apparently lost custody and the cousin said Sandy most often stayed with her father, identified as Andrew Bain Morden, a Marine Corps veteran who fought in the Korean War. Schultz says she likely fell through the cracks when one parent thought the other had her. She last attended Wilson High School in Portland. Schultz told the Oregonian that the father likely thought she was with her mother. He had left her alone for an extended period of time and when he came back, she was gone, so he assumed she had gone to her mother’s home. “We don’t know for certain,” Schultz says. “We know that’s what family members believe.”Both parents are dead, so there is no way to confirm what either of them knew. Schultz told the Oregonian that it is the birthday greeting that bothers him most. It was posted around the time the extended family says she disappeared. “Was it just a mom who loved her daughter–or did her mom know something and put it out there for that reason?” Schultz said. “It’s one of those two, right? You ponder it. You look at it and you think, ‘What does it mean?’”Now detectives are looking for the missing puzzle pieces. They are calling on anyone who might have any information about Morden, her parents, or how she might have died to contact the Clark County Medical Examiner's Office or Clark County Sheriff's Office Cold Case Tip Line.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

India Farmers Plan Nationwide Protest Against 16-Nation Trade Deal,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 08:50:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/india-farmers-plan-nationwide-protest-125007797.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. India’s farmers’ organizations have planned a nationwide protest on Nov. 4 to demand that the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi keep agriculture out of a 16-nation trade agreement currently being negotiated in Thailand.The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, an umbrella organization of about 250 farmers unions from across the country, said that they will burn effigies depicting the China-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership or RCEP, to mark their protest and warn the government.Indian farmers won’t be able to compete should the country agree to cut duties for agricultural and dairy products in the proposed trade pact, said V.M. Singh, a convener of the the farmers’ group. Imports of dairy and agricultural products including wheat, cotton and oil seeds would affect the livelihood of millions of Indian farmers, he said.The government should defer signing of the agreement and hold consultations with farmers, state governments and other stake holders before taking a final decision, said Singh. “We have to stop RCEP,” he said.It is not clear yet what terms India will agree to in order to join what could become the world’s largest trade deal. The final stage of negotiations have begun in Bangkok and Indian trade minister Piyush Goyal will travel for the ministerial meeting there on Nov. 1. The nations are seeking to conclude the negotiations by November end.To contact the reporter on this story: Bibhudatta Pradhan in New Delhi at bpradhan@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ruth Pollard at rpollard2@bloomberg.net, Muneeza Naqvi, Abhay SinghFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GF2o4tZmPCtqpE8IuBOemg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/38b9b9b23d04b76ac5ea78347d209b84,India Farmers Plan Nationwide Protest Against 16-Nation Trade Deal

"KGB Judged ‘Comrade V.V. Putin’ a Disciplined, Conscientious Spy","Thu, 31 Oct 2019 06:46:29 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/kgb-judged-comrade-v-v-104629972.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin was “prompt, disciplined and conscientious” as a spy in the KGB, according to a declassified profile from the Soviet Union’s feared security service.“Comrade V.V. Putin constantly improves his ideological and political standards,” according to the document exhibited at the Central State Archive for Historical-Political Documents of St. Petersburg, the Russian leader’s home city. “He’s actively engaged in party education work.”The profile, which is also on show at a Moscow exhibition of “outstanding figures” of modern Russian history, describes Putin as “morally upstanding” and enjoying “well-deserved authority among colleagues,” noting that he won a judo championship in 1978.Putin joined the KGB in 1975 after graduating from the law faculty of Leningrad State University, located in what’s now St. Petersburg, and served as a spy for more than 15 years until the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991. Putin asked to become a KGB officer even before he finished school, according to his Kremlin biography, which cites him saying his view of the organization “was based on idealistic stories I heard about intelligence.”He served in Dresden in East Germany from 1985 until 1990, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel during a largely undistinguished stint, and was awarded a bronze medal for service to the National People’s Army of the German Democratic Republic. He headed the Federal Security Service, the main successor agency of the KGB, in 1998-1999 before President Boris Yeltsin made him prime minister and named Putin as his chosen successor. Putin was elected president in 2000.The KGB’s appraisal of Putin, which appears to be from the late 1970s or early 1980s, was absolutely standard and showed that he hadn’t stood out or achieved anything in particular, according to Alexei Kondaurov, a former KGB general. “Usually we wrote ‘morally upstanding’ when there was nothing else to say,” he said.Still, there’s been “colossal” public interest in the document, shown as part of commemorations of the archive’s 90th anniversary, said Olga Bobrova, deputy head of the institution.To contact the reporters on this story: Irina Reznik in Moscow at ireznik@bloomberg.net;Henry Meyer in Moscow at hmeyer4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Gregory L.

Chris Christie Is Among Lawyers Reaping $15 Million in 1MDB Deal,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:33:49 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/chris-christie-among-lawyers-reaping-133349408.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest recovery ever from an American anti-corruption crackdown is proving lucrative for former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.A major deal struck by the U.S. for fugitive financier Jho Low to give up almost $1 billion in assets allegedly stolen from a Malaysian investment fund comes with a provision to pay his lawyers. As part of the 1MDB settlement, the Justice Department allowed for $15 million to be paid to a group advising Jho Low, including the law firm Christie set up after two terms as New Jersey’s governor.Those proceeds will come from Jho Low’s stake in EMI Music Publishing, which has grown to about $415 million. That investment ballooned after he initially put in a little more than $100 million stolen from 1MDB, according to prosecutors. The two sides agreed to the provision to allow the lawyers to extract fees from Low, whose assets and accounts have been seized or monitored by authorities across the world.“We were pleased to help negotiate this historic resolution in order to preserve the tremendous value of assets involved,” Christie said in a statement after the Justice Department announced the settlement agreement on Wednesday. It still needs approval from a federal judge.Christie, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 before dropping out and endorsing Donald Trump, set up his own law firm last year, the Christie Law Firm LLC. The other firms that will receive proceeds of the 1MDB deal for legal expenses are Kobre & Kim LLP and Lowenstein Sandler LLP.The agreement comes even before the criminal charges against Low have been resolved. In the settlement, the Justice Department cautioned that the released funds should be used only for the Low family’s legal fees and costs related to the lawsuits, and can’t be routed back to Low or his family.To contact the reporter on this story: Sridhar Natarajan in New York at snatarajan15@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

She climbed Everest nine times and set a world record – so why doesn’t she have sponsors?,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 02:00:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/she-climbed-everest-nine-times-060021913.html,"Lhakpa Sherpa works for minimum wages and currently washes dishes, as she trains for her 10th Everest summit with no endorsement deals, no nutritionist and no trainerLhakpa Sherpa in Talcott Mountain state park in Simsbury, Connecticut, where she hikes to prepare for her 10th summit of Everest in the spring of 2020. Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The GuardianI reach Lhakpa Sherpa’s West Hartford apartment at noon on an overcast Sunday in Connecticut. She bounds out of the front door, embraces me, and welcomes me inside. The small apartment is dimly lit. The living room has a few chairs, and a wall of sports medals from her two daughters’ 5Ks and gymnastic meets.Lhakpa was the first Nepalese woman to summit Everest and descend alive, which she accomplished in the spring of 2000. With nine summits, she holds the world record for women. She plans to summit the world’s highest mountain again in the spring of 2020, but as an unsponsored athlete and single mother of three, it’s difficult to afford training and travel. She currently works at Whole Foods washing dishes, making minimum wage. Unable to afford or drive a car, she walks to work and occasionally takes an Uber to training destinations.Sitting in her living room, I’m struck by her achievements – but also her lack of resources. How is it that a woman with such demonstrated accomplishment and skill is without sponsorship, and must risk nearly everything to continue to climb the Himalayan mountains she loves?Lhakpa makes tea while I chat with her 13-year-old daughter, Shiny, who – more fluent in technology and the English language – acts as her mother’s manager and occasional translator.“What’s it like for you,” I ask, “when your mother is away on an expedition?”> I want to show the world I can do it. I want to show women who look like me that they can do it, too.She turns her phone over in her hands. “It’s hard,” she says. “I’m proud of her, but I worry.” Each climbing season, six to 10 climbers die on the mountain.Everest expeditions last upwards of two months, usually in May, and there are only occasional opportunities to communicate via satellite phone and Skype. Avalanches, like the one that hit base camp in 2015, have kept them out of contact for weeks at a time.“I’m very good with the mountain,” Lhakpa says, bringing me a hot cup of tea, offering her warm smile. She has a long, lush ponytail and bright eyes. “I go, but I know I will come home. I have to come home.” She looks reassuringly at Shiny.Lhakpa, 45, grew up in Balakharka, a village in the Makalu region of the Nepalese Himalayas, where her father owned tea houses, and her mother still lives. Lhakpa tells me she isn’t sure of her exact age, as there were no birth certificates, and all of her mother’s 11 children were born at home. As a child, Lhakpa had no electricity, and young girls did not attend school.Lhapka Sherpa prepares tea at her home in West Hartford. Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The Guardian“You see my family on television,” she says. “Sherpas. Climbing Everest.” Her brother Mingma Gelu Sherpa directs an expedition outfitter in Kathmandu. Her oldest brother has summited “10 or 11 times,” she says. Another brother has summited eight times, her youngest brother five, and a sister has summited once.“If there weren’t any Sherpas,” she tells me, “nobody could climb Everest”.She worries when people say that anyone can climb Everest if they have the money – she’s heard people say that it’s just a matter of putting one foot in front of the other, and that Sherpas will do all the work. An average climb with a western outfitter costs upwards of $50,000, while a Nepalese outfitter costs upwards of $30,000.She has seen firsthand all the ways people can die on Everest: avalanches, falls, the thin air of the dead zone. Climbers must occasionally pass bodies, of which there are over a 100 on the mountain. (Bodies are dangerous to take down and doing so requires the effort of at least five sherpas.) Sherpas pass through the Khumbu icefall roughly 40 times just to make sure tourists have the supplies and ropes they need. If you spend enough time in the icefall, she says, you are guaranteed to die.“Why do we do this job?” she asks. “Because the alternative is to make money growing potatoes.”For Lhakpa, to say climbing Everest is easy is an insult. The fact that it is said at all reveals the problematic ways privilege has woven itself into adventure culture.Lhakpa Sherpa and her daughter Shiny, who says of her mother: ‘I’m proud of her, but I worry.’ Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The Guardian•••Serena Williams won the Australian Open while 23 weeks pregnant; Lhakpa Sherpa summited Everest eight months after the birth of her first child, and again while two months pregnant with Shiny.But unlike Williams, Lhakpa has no endorsement deals, no nutritionist, no trainer. She can’t afford to train full time, or much at all, because she works constantly in order to pay her rent.When she leaves her hourly jobs for climbing expeditions, she risks homelessness. When she returns, she picks up as much work as she can, working as a cashier at 7-Eleven and cleaning houses. “I never tell them about Everest,” she says, recounting a time when an employer realized that the woman mopping his floor was a world-renowned athlete.When I approached her for an interview, I asked her if we could hike together. As we prepare to leave for the walk, I notice that the grommet on Lhakpa’s hiking boots is broken, and she struggles to lace them. I’ve seen athletes with lesser accomplishments – but a higher number of Instagram followers – receive impressive amounts of free gear. Lhakpa mentions that her worn, orange Osprey backpack has summited Everest at least twice.Lhakpa Sherpa in 2006, when she broke her own record for the most Everest summits by a woman. Photograph: Prakash Mathema/AFP/GettyIn an era where many organizations profess a desire to diversify outdoors culture, it is difficult to process that such an accomplished athlete – with an authentic connection to the place she climbs - remains unsupported. I presume the root cause is that Lhakpa is not traditionally marketable, and brands want maximum visibility. She doesn’t have a curated Instagram presence. She’s a middle-aged woman of color, an immigrant single mother who speaks in broken English. She doesn’t exude “stoke”. She’s known to climb slowly on the lower slopes, at the advice of the Icefall Doctors, the Sherpas who manage the ropes and ladders over deep crevasses.In person, Lhakpa’s words are laced with intelligence and humor, and her passion for climbing is evident. “This is my gift,” she says of climbing. Though she would have liked to become a doctor or pilot in another life, she knows her talent is getting herself and others on top of some of the world’s largest peaks. Though Black Diamond sponsored an earlier climb, Lhakpa is currently without support.Her dream is to summit Everest in May 2020, followed by K2, a mountain whose summit once eluded her because of inclement weather. She knows this plan is ambitious, if not crazy. “All extreme athletes are crazy,” she says. “But I want to show the world I can do it. I want to show women who look like me that they can do it, too.”•••We take an easy hike on Talcott Mountain, a place she often goes with friends for a quick walk. She occasionally stops to place her hand on a rock face. We talk about the sounds of Everest, particularly the groaning ice. She shows me how she sleeps in a tent on the coldest nights, with her hands clasped underneath her body in the sleeping bag.Lhakpa began climbing in the same way many of her siblings and cousins did, helping an uncle move equipment for tourists on Makalu at 15, serving as a kitchen hand and porter. She says she was a tomboy, and that her mother worried she would never get married. She met her first husband on the mountain, and they moved to the United States in 2002. They often climbed together, until the relationship turned violent.> Climbing is my way out of washing dishes. It is the way to make a better life for the girlsIn 2004, her husband notoriously struck her on Everest, continuing a pattern of abuse that began upon the birth of their first child and continued on expeditions and at home. A difficult few years followed, with the family’s fortunes falling; by 2012 they were on food stamps. After further attacks, hospitalizations, and a stay at a shelter, the couple divorced, and Lhakpa was awarded full custody of the girls.I first learned about Lhakpa years ago, through the story of the 2004 climb, and have thought several times how damaging to her climbing career it must have been. She was forced to endure physical and emotional hardship in front of her professional community, and did not have the ability to control the public narrative. She left her marriage with no financial resources and two dependents. (Her oldest child, Nima, a son from another relationship, is now an adult.) She undoubtedly lost good climbing years to adversity, and yet her commitment to climbing persists.It has always seemed unfair to me to ask female athletes and artists about their marriage and children. Were the “great” male explorers of the past – or even the present – asked as often about how their children are cared for during an adventure, or if it’s OK to take certain risks – but to leave Lhakpa’s marriage and children out of the picture would perhaps be to hide one of her greatest challenges, and most profound motivations.“Climbing is my way out of washing dishes,” Lhakpa tells me. “It is the way to make a better life for the girls.”•••Lhakpa Sherpa: ‘If you don’t trust, you die.’ Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The GuardianAs we walk the well-worn paths of Talcott Mountain back to my car, Shiny becomes concerned about mosquitoes. “I don’t want you to get EEE when you’re out hiking,” she tells Lhakpa. I think about how difficult it must be to process the risks her mother takes, all while knowing her lifetime record of resilient comebacks. They look out for each other. Even when Lhakpa is posing for photographs at an outlook, she has one eye on her youngest daughter, and cautions her against stepping too close to the ridge line.Lhakpa and I talk about the difference between climbing Everest as a Sherpa, and as a climber. One you do for someone else, and the other you do for yourself. She expresses a moving amount of devotion to the clients Sherpas guide to the summit.“You make a promise,” she says, “and you keep it.” Lhakpa talks a lot about trust – trusting herself, trusting the climbing partner she’s tethered to, trusting the mountain. “If you don’t trust,” she says, “you die.”“I’m a small mouse climbing a big mountain,” Lhakpa tells me. Her relationship with the mountain is reverent, as if she’s in conversation with it. “Share with the mountain,” she says. “If you’re scared, your fear scares the mountain.” She even delayed 2019’s planned climb because of her beloved father’s death. “I didn’t want to carry the sadness,” she says. “It would not be safe.”When we get back to the apartment, Lhakpa shows me her boots and insulated Red Fox suit. “I look like a bear,” she says, slipping into the gear, which is reminiscent of a wearable sleeping bag. During climbing season, the temperatures on Everest’s summit range from -4F to -31F.Lhakpa displays the 50-year-old oxygen mask she wears because she says it’s more reliable than the new ones. Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The GuardianShe also wears a 50-year-old oxygen mask, because she believes it’s more reliable than the new ones. “I need smart students,” she says, asking me if I can find someone to design a better mask based on the old models. I picture a group of bright minds at MIT listening to this woman – this expert – who has grown up on the mountain and knows what climbers need as they step into the thin air of Everest.These are the other things Lhakpa wants: sponsorship for her historic 10th climb. Time to train and build her guiding business, Cloudscape Climbing. A life spent on the mountains and not cleaning dishes and taking out trash. A book and documentary about her life. Money to help send her bright daughters to college.“These are not quick dreams,” she adds. “They are long dreams.”Lhakpa has always worked hard to survive, and to subvert expectations. In the past, people have discounted the summits of Sherpas, saying that their familiarity with the altitude and location somehow diminishes the accomplishment. Lhakpa, who dared to step outside of a service culture and climb for herself, wants a 10th summit, and is serious about advancing her record.When I ask Shiny what she admires most about her mother, she pauses. “There is so much,” she says, her voice shaking. “But I would have to say her confidence.”Lhakpa is self-conscious of her hands, dried from washing dishes, and the jobs she must work in order to support her family.

Sign up here. India’s farmers’ organizations have planned a nationwide protest on Nov. 4 to demand that the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi keep agriculture out of a 16-nation trade agreement currently being negotiated in Thailand.The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, an umbrella organization of about 250 farmers unions from across the country, said that they will burn effigies depicting the China-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership or RCEP, to mark their protest and warn the government.Indian farmers won’t be able to compete should the country agree to cut duties for agricultural and dairy products in the proposed trade pact, said V.M. Singh, a convener of the the farmers’ group. Imports of dairy and agricultural products including wheat, cotton and oil seeds would affect the livelihood of millions of Indian farmers, he said.The government should defer signing of the agreement and hold consultations with farmers, state governments and other stake holders before taking a final decision, said Singh. “We have to stop RCEP,” he said.It is not clear yet what terms India will agree to in order to join what could become the world’s largest trade deal. The final stage of negotiations have begun in Bangkok and Indian trade minister Piyush Goyal will travel for the ministerial meeting there on Nov. 1. The nations are seeking to conclude the negotiations by November end.To contact the reporter on this story: Bibhudatta Pradhan in New Delhi at bpradhan@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ruth Pollard at rpollard2@bloomberg.net, Muneeza Naqvi, Abhay SinghFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GF2o4tZmPCtqpE8IuBOemg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/38b9b9b23d04b76ac5ea78347d209b84,India Farmers Plan Nationwide Protest Against 16-Nation Trade Deal

Authorities Identify ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe’ Through DNA and Now the Real Questions Start,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:13:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/authorities-identify-fly-creek-jane-131307745.html,"On a chilly February Sunday in 1980, a father and son panning for gold along Fly Creek in Clark County, Washington, kicked up the remains of a human skeleton that appeared to have been buried in a shallow grave. They called the authorities who came to collect the skull and what bones hadn’t been dragged away by animals, and were able to use the remains to construct a facial reconstruction that produced a picture of a teenage girl. Detectives were able to deduce that she died from a cause that did not seem natural. Calls for information, searches through missing persons reports, and detective work turned up nothing. No one seemed to miss the teen, dubbed the ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe,’ and, for the last 40 years, that is as far as the case went–until now.This summer Clark County detectives decided to post a DNA sample from the old remains to the Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, a public genealogy database that has had recent success closing old cold cases. The lab found a tie to a distant cousin of a teen named Sandra “Sandy” Renee Morden who said she was last seen in 1977–three years before her skeletal remains were found. Courtesy of Clark County SheriffThe Oregonian then dug up an old birthday announcement that was tied to the case. On April 29, 1977, in the classified section of the paper, a tiny ad appeared that said: “Sandra Renee Morden, Happy 15th Birthday. Love Always—Mom.” Such published greetings were a common way to mark a birthday or anniversary in the era before Facebook and other social media. Morden’s parents were divorced, according to the DNA-linked cousin, who does not want to be named and who provided Clark County cold-case detective Lindsay Schultz with the only clues the teen’s life. Schultz told the Oregonian that Morden was a “latchkey kid” who was mostly “unsupervised.” There is no indication that the parents filed a missing persons report, and, as Schultz says, “We didn’t have [the National Crime Information Center] at that time.” The detective says Morden’s parents came from the San Francisco area and settled in Portland. They split up in the early 1970s, and did not communicate with each other. The girl’s mother, identified as Kathryn Irene Morden, apparently lost custody and the cousin said Sandy most often stayed with her father, identified as Andrew Bain Morden, a Marine Corps veteran who fought in the Korean War. Schultz says she likely fell through the cracks when one parent thought the other had her. She last attended Wilson High School in Portland. Schultz told the Oregonian that the father likely thought she was with her mother. He had left her alone for an extended period of time and when he came back, she was gone, so he assumed she had gone to her mother’s home. “We don’t know for certain,” Schultz says. “We know that’s what family members believe.”Both parents are dead, so there is no way to confirm what either of them knew. Schultz told the Oregonian that it is the birthday greeting that bothers him most. It was posted around the time the extended family says she disappeared. “Was it just a mom who loved her daughter–or did her mom know something and put it out there for that reason?” Schultz said. “It’s one of those two, right? You ponder it. You look at it and you think, ‘What does it mean?’”Now detectives are looking for the missing puzzle pieces. They are calling on anyone who might have any information about Morden, her parents, or how she might have died to contact the Clark County Medical Examiner's Office or Clark County Sheriff's Office Cold Case Tip Line.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

A Nobel Peace Prize for Vladimir Putin? That’s the Talk in Moscow.,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 05:40:49 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/nobel-peace-prize-vladimir-putin-094049080.html,"Adam Berry/GettyMOSCOW—For those who live outside Russia and the enormous bubble of admiration inflated around President Vladimir Putin, this story may be a bit hard to believe. But there is a movement afoot here, apparently in all sincerity, to nominate Putin for the Nobel Peace Prize.From the outside, one must wonder how the dossier for the former KGB operative might be prepared. Would it include the peace of the grave imposed on civilians in the Second Chechen War early in Putin’s presidency? Or would it be for backing quasi states broken away from the Republic of Georgia? Or, more recently, for the forcible annexation of Crimea and the instigation of a separatist war in Ukraine that continues to this day? Alex Gibney: How Donald Trump Is Morphing Into Vladimir PutinOr perhaps he’d win for Syria, where Putin is a strong supporter of the Assad dictatorship that has killed hundreds of thousands of people while half of the nation’s population has been driven into internal or external exile. Would that be the venue for Putin the peacemaker to earn his Nobel laurels?In fact, through the looking glass of Moscow’s media and Putin’s supporters, Ukraine and Syria are held up as prime examples of his eligibility for The Prize.The general secretary of the Russian-Turkish Public Forum, Sergey Markov, who is close to the Kremlin, tells The Daily Beast that there is no better candidate for the prestigious award than Putin: “Most Russian state officials believe that President Putin deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for saving the world from a nuclear war during the crisis in Ukraine in 2014—for holding back and not bringing Russian forces to Kharkiv, Dnepropetrovsk, [Ukrainian] cities full of Russian people,” Markov said, adding, “Of course Putin should be given the prize for solving the Turkish-Kurdish conflict, which risked taking thousands of lives.” Forget U.S. President Donald Trump’s efforts to claim credit for a ceasefire deal with Ankara, Putin’s supporters in Moscow believe that it was Putin alone who managed to find the solution and negotiate a deal with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that prevented a Turkish-Kurdish bloodbath. Whoever is responsible, the arrangement is essentially on Erdogan’s terms, opening the way for ethnic cleansing as Kurdish troops withdraw, Kurdish civilians flee, and Erdogan plans to move millions of Syrian Arabs, most of them from other parts of the country, into what Erdogan calls a “safe zone.”Yet Aleksey Venediktov, editor-in-chief of the influential independent radio station Echo of Moscow, tweeted last week as that deal came down: “They tell me at the top: ‘Now you understand, Putin deserves a Nobel Peace Prize.’” He said his high-level sources were telling him Putin’s Syria deal was like “the new Camp David Accord,” putting it on a par with the 1978 agreement brokered by President Jimmy Carter that ended generations of war between Israel and Egypt. In truth, the Russian leader has been looking to win The Prize for years. Ever since Time magazine put Putin on the cover as Person of the Year in 2007, the Kremlin’s ideologues have believed that the West recognizes Putin as the world’s preeminent politician—and peacemaker—and no wars in Georgia, Ukraine or Syria could dissuade them.Putin’s greatest accomplishment on that score probably came in 2013 when President Barack Obama was weighing the possibility of major military strikes on the Bashar al-Assad regime to retaliate for its use of chemical weapons, and Putin stepped in with a better—or at least more peaceful—plan. He persuaded Assad, first, to admit he had a chemical arsenal, which he had never done before. Then Assad agreed to U.N. inspections as he eliminated everything he admitted to having, and by all accounts the vast majority of those gruesome weapons were destroyed. At the time, that seemed like a major war averted, and therefore a pathway to peace.So at the beginning of 2014 a Russian advocacy group called the International Academy of Spiritual Unity and Cooperation of People put Putin up for the prize.Unfortunately for Putin’s aspirations, there’s quite a long delay between the nominations at the beginning of the year, and the awards at the end, and Putin was not exactly making peace in 2014. Reacting to a popular pro-European, largely anti-Russian uprising in Ukraine, he seized the Crimean Peninsula, annexed it to Russia, and poured support into separatist rebels in Eastern Ukraine. The death toll soon climbed into the thousands, with hundreds of thousands of people displaced. In July 2014 a Russian-supplied missile shot down a Malaysian Airliner en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur with 298 people on board, all of whom died.If anyone argued in 2014, as Markov suggests, that Putin should have gotten a peace prize for not staging a massive, direct invasion of Ukraine to take the large cities of Kharkiv and Dnepropetrovsk, the Nobel Committee in Norway clearly was not persuaded. It gave the 2014 prize to Kailash Satyarthi and Malala Yousafzai ""for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education.""Russia’s record in Syria has been equally bloody since it entered the fight directly to support Assad in 2015.  One recent example was a Russian-Syrian military strike on a center for hundreds of displaced people in the town of Haas in Idlib that killed 20 civilians in August. A Human Rights Watch investigation published in October qualified the attack as “an apparent war crime.” Sara Kayyali who monitors the violations on the ground for HRW, tells The Daily Beast that “Russian strikes on protected humanitarian infrastructure” have been common in the areas where they operate, with “severely negative consequences.”Now, says Kayyali, “Russia has brokered an agreement with Turkey around a so-called ‘safe zone,’ but as history has proved again and again, safe zones are rarely safe.” President Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov gloated last week, saying, ""The United States was the closest ally of the Kurds during the last few years, and in the end the U.S. ditched the Kurds and effectively betrayed them."" By arranging for the withdrawal of the fighters, Peskov suggested, Russia is at least saving their lives. The United States looks foolish and treacherous, to be sure. But some analysts suggest Russia’s schadenfreude is premature. David Aaron Miller at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace notes that among some in Washington, “Animosity toward Trump and Putin—richly deserved—is clouding the analysis on Syria  and triggering overreaction about Russia’s gains.”As Miller points out, “Russia has been the dominant external power in Syria since at least the 1970s. And the U.S. withdrawal has no doubt consolidated that and elevated Russia’s role in the region. But we shouldn’t overestimate Moscow’s gains.  They now preside over a broken country that will take years and billions to heal. They are shackled with a pariah regime—both entitled and dependent—that will continue to alienate the majority of the Sunni population; they face a resurgent ISIS and are now shackled with responsibility for managing both the Turkish-Syrian-Kurdish triangle and a potential Israeli-Iranian conflict.”“The idea of giving Putin a Nobel Peace Prize sounds ridiculous after years of this dirty war in Syria, the Russian military violating international law, using banned weapons, bombing hospitals and clinics,” Tania Lokshina, Europe and Central Asia associate director at Human Rights Watch Moscow, told The Daily Beast. But still the dream lives on, revived by the agreement moving the Kurds out of the region near the Turkish border. Last week the Russian news agency riafan.ru headlined: “Foreigners propose to award Putin with a Nobel Prize for peace in Syria.” The deadline for Nobel nominations is January 31. One can only guess at the peace initiatives Putin will carry out between now and then.Is Trump Saving Those Syrian Oil Fields for the Russians?Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Chris Christie Is Among Lawyers Reaping $15 Million in 1MDB Deal,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:33:49 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/chris-christie-among-lawyers-reaping-133349408.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest recovery ever from an American anti-corruption crackdown is proving lucrative for former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.A major deal struck by the U.S. for fugitive financier Jho Low to give up almost $1 billion in assets allegedly stolen from a Malaysian investment fund comes with a provision to pay his lawyers. As part of the 1MDB settlement, the Justice Department allowed for $15 million to be paid to a group advising Jho Low, including the law firm Christie set up after two terms as New Jersey’s governor.Those proceeds will come from Jho Low’s stake in EMI Music Publishing, which has grown to about $415 million. That investment ballooned after he initially put in a little more than $100 million stolen from 1MDB, according to prosecutors. The two sides agreed to the provision to allow the lawyers to extract fees from Low, whose assets and accounts have been seized or monitored by authorities across the world.“We were pleased to help negotiate this historic resolution in order to preserve the tremendous value of assets involved,” Christie said in a statement after the Justice Department announced the settlement agreement on Wednesday. It still needs approval from a federal judge.Christie, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 before dropping out and endorsing Donald Trump, set up his own law firm last year, the Christie Law Firm LLC. The other firms that will receive proceeds of the 1MDB deal for legal expenses are Kobre & Kim LLP and Lowenstein Sandler LLP.The agreement comes even before the criminal charges against Low have been resolved. In the settlement, the Justice Department cautioned that the released funds should be used only for the Low family’s legal fees and costs related to the lawsuits, and can’t be routed back to Low or his family.To contact the reporter on this story: Sridhar Natarajan in New York at snatarajan15@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

She climbed Everest nine times and set a world record – so why doesn’t she have sponsors?,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 02:00:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/she-climbed-everest-nine-times-060021913.html,"Lhakpa Sherpa works for minimum wages and currently washes dishes, as she trains for her 10th Everest summit with no endorsement deals, no nutritionist and no trainerLhakpa Sherpa in Talcott Mountain state park in Simsbury, Connecticut, where she hikes to prepare for her 10th summit of Everest in the spring of 2020. Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The GuardianI reach Lhakpa Sherpa’s West Hartford apartment at noon on an overcast Sunday in Connecticut. She bounds out of the front door, embraces me, and welcomes me inside. The small apartment is dimly lit. The living room has a few chairs, and a wall of sports medals from her two daughters’ 5Ks and gymnastic meets.Lhakpa was the first Nepalese woman to summit Everest and descend alive, which she accomplished in the spring of 2000. With nine summits, she holds the world record for women. She plans to summit the world’s highest mountain again in the spring of 2020, but as an unsponsored athlete and single mother of three, it’s difficult to afford training and travel. She currently works at Whole Foods washing dishes, making minimum wage. Unable to afford or drive a car, she walks to work and occasionally takes an Uber to training destinations.Sitting in her living room, I’m struck by her achievements – but also her lack of resources. How is it that a woman with such demonstrated accomplishment and skill is without sponsorship, and must risk nearly everything to continue to climb the Himalayan mountains she loves?Lhakpa makes tea while I chat with her 13-year-old daughter, Shiny, who – more fluent in technology and the English language – acts as her mother’s manager and occasional translator.“What’s it like for you,” I ask, “when your mother is away on an expedition?”> I want to show the world I can do it. I want to show women who look like me that they can do it, too.She turns her phone over in her hands. “It’s hard,” she says. “I’m proud of her, but I worry.” Each climbing season, six to 10 climbers die on the mountain.Everest expeditions last upwards of two months, usually in May, and there are only occasional opportunities to communicate via satellite phone and Skype. Avalanches, like the one that hit base camp in 2015, have kept them out of contact for weeks at a time.“I’m very good with the mountain,” Lhakpa says, bringing me a hot cup of tea, offering her warm smile. She has a long, lush ponytail and bright eyes. “I go, but I know I will come home. I have to come home.” She looks reassuringly at Shiny.Lhakpa, 45, grew up in Balakharka, a village in the Makalu region of the Nepalese Himalayas, where her father owned tea houses, and her mother still lives. Lhakpa tells me she isn’t sure of her exact age, as there were no birth certificates, and all of her mother’s 11 children were born at home. As a child, Lhakpa had no electricity, and young girls did not attend school.Lhapka Sherpa prepares tea at her home in West Hartford. Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The Guardian“You see my family on television,” she says. “Sherpas. Climbing Everest.” Her brother Mingma Gelu Sherpa directs an expedition outfitter in Kathmandu. Her oldest brother has summited “10 or 11 times,” she says. Another brother has summited eight times, her youngest brother five, and a sister has summited once.“If there weren’t any Sherpas,” she tells me, “nobody could climb Everest”.She worries when people say that anyone can climb Everest if they have the money – she’s heard people say that it’s just a matter of putting one foot in front of the other, and that Sherpas will do all the work. An average climb with a western outfitter costs upwards of $50,000, while a Nepalese outfitter costs upwards of $30,000.She has seen firsthand all the ways people can die on Everest: avalanches, falls, the thin air of the dead zone. Climbers must occasionally pass bodies, of which there are over a 100 on the mountain. (Bodies are dangerous to take down and doing so requires the effort of at least five sherpas.) Sherpas pass through the Khumbu icefall roughly 40 times just to make sure tourists have the supplies and ropes they need. If you spend enough time in the icefall, she says, you are guaranteed to die.“Why do we do this job?” she asks. “Because the alternative is to make money growing potatoes.”For Lhakpa, to say climbing Everest is easy is an insult. The fact that it is said at all reveals the problematic ways privilege has woven itself into adventure culture.Lhakpa Sherpa and her daughter Shiny, who says of her mother: ‘I’m proud of her, but I worry.’ Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The Guardian•••Serena Williams won the Australian Open while 23 weeks pregnant; Lhakpa Sherpa summited Everest eight months after the birth of her first child, and again while two months pregnant with Shiny.But unlike Williams, Lhakpa has no endorsement deals, no nutritionist, no trainer. She can’t afford to train full time, or much at all, because she works constantly in order to pay her rent.When she leaves her hourly jobs for climbing expeditions, she risks homelessness. When she returns, she picks up as much work as she can, working as a cashier at 7-Eleven and cleaning houses. “I never tell them about Everest,” she says, recounting a time when an employer realized that the woman mopping his floor was a world-renowned athlete.When I approached her for an interview, I asked her if we could hike together. As we prepare to leave for the walk, I notice that the grommet on Lhakpa’s hiking boots is broken, and she struggles to lace them. I’ve seen athletes with lesser accomplishments – but a higher number of Instagram followers – receive impressive amounts of free gear. Lhakpa mentions that her worn, orange Osprey backpack has summited Everest at least twice.Lhakpa Sherpa in 2006, when she broke her own record for the most Everest summits by a woman. Photograph: Prakash Mathema/AFP/GettyIn an era where many organizations profess a desire to diversify outdoors culture, it is difficult to process that such an accomplished athlete – with an authentic connection to the place she climbs - remains unsupported. I presume the root cause is that Lhakpa is not traditionally marketable, and brands want maximum visibility. She doesn’t have a curated Instagram presence. She’s a middle-aged woman of color, an immigrant single mother who speaks in broken English. She doesn’t exude “stoke”. She’s known to climb slowly on the lower slopes, at the advice of the Icefall Doctors, the Sherpas who manage the ropes and ladders over deep crevasses.In person, Lhakpa’s words are laced with intelligence and humor, and her passion for climbing is evident. “This is my gift,” she says of climbing. Though she would have liked to become a doctor or pilot in another life, she knows her talent is getting herself and others on top of some of the world’s largest peaks. Though Black Diamond sponsored an earlier climb, Lhakpa is currently without support.Her dream is to summit Everest in May 2020, followed by K2, a mountain whose summit once eluded her because of inclement weather. She knows this plan is ambitious, if not crazy. “All extreme athletes are crazy,” she says. “But I want to show the world I can do it. I want to show women who look like me that they can do it, too.”•••We take an easy hike on Talcott Mountain, a place she often goes with friends for a quick walk. She occasionally stops to place her hand on a rock face. We talk about the sounds of Everest, particularly the groaning ice. She shows me how she sleeps in a tent on the coldest nights, with her hands clasped underneath her body in the sleeping bag.Lhakpa began climbing in the same way many of her siblings and cousins did, helping an uncle move equipment for tourists on Makalu at 15, serving as a kitchen hand and porter. She says she was a tomboy, and that her mother worried she would never get married. She met her first husband on the mountain, and they moved to the United States in 2002. They often climbed together, until the relationship turned violent.> Climbing is my way out of washing dishes. It is the way to make a better life for the girlsIn 2004, her husband notoriously struck her on Everest, continuing a pattern of abuse that began upon the birth of their first child and continued on expeditions and at home. A difficult few years followed, with the family’s fortunes falling; by 2012 they were on food stamps. After further attacks, hospitalizations, and a stay at a shelter, the couple divorced, and Lhakpa was awarded full custody of the girls.I first learned about Lhakpa years ago, through the story of the 2004 climb, and have thought several times how damaging to her climbing career it must have been. She was forced to endure physical and emotional hardship in front of her professional community, and did not have the ability to control the public narrative. She left her marriage with no financial resources and two dependents. (Her oldest child, Nima, a son from another relationship, is now an adult.) She undoubtedly lost good climbing years to adversity, and yet her commitment to climbing persists.It has always seemed unfair to me to ask female athletes and artists about their marriage and children. Were the “great” male explorers of the past – or even the present – asked as often about how their children are cared for during an adventure, or if it’s OK to take certain risks – but to leave Lhakpa’s marriage and children out of the picture would perhaps be to hide one of her greatest challenges, and most profound motivations.“Climbing is my way out of washing dishes,” Lhakpa tells me. “It is the way to make a better life for the girls.”•••Lhakpa Sherpa: ‘If you don’t trust, you die.’ Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The GuardianAs we walk the well-worn paths of Talcott Mountain back to my car, Shiny becomes concerned about mosquitoes. “I don’t want you to get EEE when you’re out hiking,” she tells Lhakpa. I think about how difficult it must be to process the risks her mother takes, all while knowing her lifetime record of resilient comebacks. They look out for each other. Even when Lhakpa is posing for photographs at an outlook, she has one eye on her youngest daughter, and cautions her against stepping too close to the ridge line.Lhakpa and I talk about the difference between climbing Everest as a Sherpa, and as a climber. One you do for someone else, and the other you do for yourself. She expresses a moving amount of devotion to the clients Sherpas guide to the summit.“You make a promise,” she says, “and you keep it.” Lhakpa talks a lot about trust – trusting herself, trusting the climbing partner she’s tethered to, trusting the mountain. “If you don’t trust,” she says, “you die.”“I’m a small mouse climbing a big mountain,” Lhakpa tells me. Her relationship with the mountain is reverent, as if she’s in conversation with it. “Share with the mountain,” she says. “If you’re scared, your fear scares the mountain.” She even delayed 2019’s planned climb because of her beloved father’s death. “I didn’t want to carry the sadness,” she says. “It would not be safe.”When we get back to the apartment, Lhakpa shows me her boots and insulated Red Fox suit. “I look like a bear,” she says, slipping into the gear, which is reminiscent of a wearable sleeping bag. During climbing season, the temperatures on Everest’s summit range from -4F to -31F.Lhakpa displays the 50-year-old oxygen mask she wears because she says it’s more reliable than the new ones. Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The GuardianShe also wears a 50-year-old oxygen mask, because she believes it’s more reliable than the new ones. “I need smart students,” she says, asking me if I can find someone to design a better mask based on the old models. I picture a group of bright minds at MIT listening to this woman – this expert – who has grown up on the mountain and knows what climbers need as they step into the thin air of Everest.These are the other things Lhakpa wants: sponsorship for her historic 10th climb. Time to train and build her guiding business, Cloudscape Climbing. A life spent on the mountains and not cleaning dishes and taking out trash. A book and documentary about her life. Money to help send her bright daughters to college.“These are not quick dreams,” she adds. “They are long dreams.”Lhakpa has always worked hard to survive, and to subvert expectations. In the past, people have discounted the summits of Sherpas, saying that their familiarity with the altitude and location somehow diminishes the accomplishment. Lhakpa, who dared to step outside of a service culture and climb for herself, wants a 10th summit, and is serious about advancing her record.When I ask Shiny what she admires most about her mother, she pauses. “There is so much,” she says, her voice shaking. “But I would have to say her confidence.”Lhakpa is self-conscious of her hands, dried from washing dishes, and the jobs she must work in order to support her family. She is also driven to inspire others, particularly women and single parents. “I would like to hide in the mountain,” Lhakpa confesses on our descent, aware of her humble circumstances. “But I have to show my face here.”",http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aTsrZU.6T7nrIx0cghr9Rw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/924e3a16db3b93dd3a85bbed5207015e,She climbed Everest nine times and set a world record – so why doesn’t she have sponsors?
India Farmers Plan Nationwide Protest Against 16-Nation Trade Deal,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 08:50:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/india-farmers-plan-nationwide-protest-125007797.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. India’s farmers’ organizations have planned a nationwide protest on Nov. 4 to demand that the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi keep agriculture out of a 16-nation trade agreement currently being negotiated in Thailand.The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, an umbrella organization of about 250 farmers unions from across the country, said that they will burn effigies depicting the China-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership or RCEP, to mark their protest and warn the government.Indian farmers won’t be able to compete should the country agree to cut duties for agricultural and dairy products in the proposed trade pact, said V.M. Singh, a convener of the the farmers’ group. Imports of dairy and agricultural products including wheat, cotton and oil seeds would affect the livelihood of millions of Indian farmers, he said.The government should defer signing of the agreement and hold consultations with farmers, state governments and other stake holders before taking a final decision, said Singh. “We have to stop RCEP,” he said.It is not clear yet what terms India will agree to in order to join what could become the world’s largest trade deal. The final stage of negotiations have begun in Bangkok and Indian trade minister Piyush Goyal will travel for the ministerial meeting there on Nov. 1. The nations are seeking to conclude the negotiations by November end.To contact the reporter on this story: Bibhudatta Pradhan in New Delhi at bpradhan@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ruth Pollard at rpollard2@bloomberg.net, Muneeza Naqvi, Abhay SinghFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GF2o4tZmPCtqpE8IuBOemg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/38b9b9b23d04b76ac5ea78347d209b84,India Farmers Plan Nationwide Protest Against 16-Nation Trade Deal

Authorities Identify ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe’ Through DNA and Now the Real Questions Start,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:13:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/authorities-identify-fly-creek-jane-131307745.html,"On a chilly February Sunday in 1980, a father and son panning for gold along Fly Creek in Clark County, Washington, kicked up the remains of a human skeleton that appeared to have been buried in a shallow grave. They called the authorities who came to collect the skull and what bones hadn’t been dragged away by animals, and were able to use the remains to construct a facial reconstruction that produced a picture of a teenage girl. Detectives were able to deduce that she died from a cause that did not seem natural. Calls for information, searches through missing persons reports, and detective work turned up nothing. No one seemed to miss the teen, dubbed the ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe,’ and, for the last 40 years, that is as far as the case went–until now.This summer Clark County detectives decided to post a DNA sample from the old remains to the Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, a public genealogy database that has had recent success closing old cold cases. The lab found a tie to a distant cousin of a teen named Sandra “Sandy” Renee Morden who said she was last seen in 1977–three years before her skeletal remains were found. Courtesy of Clark County SheriffThe Oregonian then dug up an old birthday announcement that was tied to the case. On April 29, 1977, in the classified section of the paper, a tiny ad appeared that said: “Sandra Renee Morden, Happy 15th Birthday. Love Always—Mom.” Such published greetings were a common way to mark a birthday or anniversary in the era before Facebook and other social media. Morden’s parents were divorced, according to the DNA-linked cousin, who does not want to be named and who provided Clark County cold-case detective Lindsay Schultz with the only clues the teen’s life. Schultz told the Oregonian that Morden was a “latchkey kid” who was mostly “unsupervised.” There is no indication that the parents filed a missing persons report, and, as Schultz says, “We didn’t have [the National Crime Information Center] at that time.” The detective says Morden’s parents came from the San Francisco area and settled in Portland. They split up in the early 1970s, and did not communicate with each other. The girl’s mother, identified as Kathryn Irene Morden, apparently lost custody and the cousin said Sandy most often stayed with her father, identified as Andrew Bain Morden, a Marine Corps veteran who fought in the Korean War. Schultz says she likely fell through the cracks when one parent thought the other had her. She last attended Wilson High School in Portland. Schultz told the Oregonian that the father likely thought she was with her mother. He had left her alone for an extended period of time and when he came back, she was gone, so he assumed she had gone to her mother’s home. “We don’t know for certain,” Schultz says. “We know that’s what family members believe.”Both parents are dead, so there is no way to confirm what either of them knew. Schultz told the Oregonian that it is the birthday greeting that bothers him most. It was posted around the time the extended family says she disappeared. “Was it just a mom who loved her daughter–or did her mom know something and put it out there for that reason?” Schultz said. “It’s one of those two, right? You ponder it. You look at it and you think, ‘What does it mean?’”Now detectives are looking for the missing puzzle pieces. They are calling on anyone who might have any information about Morden, her parents, or how she might have died to contact the Clark County Medical Examiner's Office or Clark County Sheriff's Office Cold Case Tip Line.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

A Nobel Peace Prize for Vladimir Putin? That’s the Talk in Moscow.,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 05:40:49 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/nobel-peace-prize-vladimir-putin-094049080.html,"Adam Berry/GettyMOSCOW—For those who live outside Russia and the enormous bubble of admiration inflated around President Vladimir Putin, this story may be a bit hard to believe. But there is a movement afoot here, apparently in all sincerity, to nominate Putin for the Nobel Peace Prize.From the outside, one must wonder how the dossier for the former KGB operative might be prepared. Would it include the peace of the grave imposed on civilians in the Second Chechen War early in Putin’s presidency? Or would it be for backing quasi states broken away from the Republic of Georgia? Or, more recently, for the forcible annexation of Crimea and the instigation of a separatist war in Ukraine that continues to this day? Alex Gibney: How Donald Trump Is Morphing Into Vladimir PutinOr perhaps he’d win for Syria, where Putin is a strong supporter of the Assad dictatorship that has killed hundreds of thousands of people while half of the nation’s population has been driven into internal or external exile. Would that be the venue for Putin the peacemaker to earn his Nobel laurels?In fact, through the looking glass of Moscow’s media and Putin’s supporters, Ukraine and Syria are held up as prime examples of his eligibility for The Prize.The general secretary of the Russian-Turkish Public Forum, Sergey Markov, who is close to the Kremlin, tells The Daily Beast that there is no better candidate for the prestigious award than Putin: “Most Russian state officials believe that President Putin deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for saving the world from a nuclear war during the crisis in Ukraine in 2014—for holding back and not bringing Russian forces to Kharkiv, Dnepropetrovsk, [Ukrainian] cities full of Russian people,” Markov said, adding, “Of course Putin should be given the prize for solving the Turkish-Kurdish conflict, which risked taking thousands of lives.” Forget U.S. President Donald Trump’s efforts to claim credit for a ceasefire deal with Ankara, Putin’s supporters in Moscow believe that it was Putin alone who managed to find the solution and negotiate a deal with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that prevented a Turkish-Kurdish bloodbath. Whoever is responsible, the arrangement is essentially on Erdogan’s terms, opening the way for ethnic cleansing as Kurdish troops withdraw, Kurdish civilians flee, and Erdogan plans to move millions of Syrian Arabs, most of them from other parts of the country, into what Erdogan calls a “safe zone.”Yet Aleksey Venediktov, editor-in-chief of the influential independent radio station Echo of Moscow, tweeted last week as that deal came down: “They tell me at the top: ‘Now you understand, Putin deserves a Nobel Peace Prize.’” He said his high-level sources were telling him Putin’s Syria deal was like “the new Camp David Accord,” putting it on a par with the 1978 agreement brokered by President Jimmy Carter that ended generations of war between Israel and Egypt. In truth, the Russian leader has been looking to win The Prize for years. Ever since Time magazine put Putin on the cover as Person of the Year in 2007, the Kremlin’s ideologues have believed that the West recognizes Putin as the world’s preeminent politician—and peacemaker—and no wars in Georgia, Ukraine or Syria could dissuade them.Putin’s greatest accomplishment on that score probably came in 2013 when President Barack Obama was weighing the possibility of major military strikes on the Bashar al-Assad regime to retaliate for its use of chemical weapons, and Putin stepped in with a better—or at least more peaceful—plan. He persuaded Assad, first, to admit he had a chemical arsenal, which he had never done before. Then Assad agreed to U.N. inspections as he eliminated everything he admitted to having, and by all accounts the vast majority of those gruesome weapons were destroyed. At the time, that seemed like a major war averted, and therefore a pathway to peace.So at the beginning of 2014 a Russian advocacy group called the International Academy of Spiritual Unity and Cooperation of People put Putin up for the prize.Unfortunately for Putin’s aspirations, there’s quite a long delay between the nominations at the beginning of the year, and the awards at the end, and Putin was not exactly making peace in 2014. Reacting to a popular pro-European, largely anti-Russian uprising in Ukraine, he seized the Crimean Peninsula, annexed it to Russia, and poured support into separatist rebels in Eastern Ukraine. The death toll soon climbed into the thousands, with hundreds of thousands of people displaced. In July 2014 a Russian-supplied missile shot down a Malaysian Airliner en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur with 298 people on board, all of whom died.If anyone argued in 2014, as Markov suggests, that Putin should have gotten a peace prize for not staging a massive, direct invasion of Ukraine to take the large cities of Kharkiv and Dnepropetrovsk, the Nobel Committee in Norway clearly was not persuaded. It gave the 2014 prize to Kailash Satyarthi and Malala Yousafzai ""for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education.""Russia’s record in Syria has been equally bloody since it entered the fight directly to support Assad in 2015.  One recent example was a Russian-Syrian military strike on a center for hundreds of displaced people in the town of Haas in Idlib that killed 20 civilians in August. A Human Rights Watch investigation published in October qualified the attack as “an apparent war crime.” Sara Kayyali who monitors the violations on the ground for HRW, tells The Daily Beast that “Russian strikes on protected humanitarian infrastructure” have been common in the areas where they operate, with “severely negative consequences.”Now, says Kayyali, “Russia has brokered an agreement with Turkey around a so-called ‘safe zone,’ but as history has proved again and again, safe zones are rarely safe.” President Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov gloated last week, saying, ""The United States was the closest ally of the Kurds during the last few years, and in the end the U.S. ditched the Kurds and effectively betrayed them."" By arranging for the withdrawal of the fighters, Peskov suggested, Russia is at least saving their lives. The United States looks foolish and treacherous, to be sure. But some analysts suggest Russia’s schadenfreude is premature. David Aaron Miller at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace notes that among some in Washington, “Animosity toward Trump and Putin—richly deserved—is clouding the analysis on Syria  and triggering overreaction about Russia’s gains.”As Miller points out, “Russia has been the dominant external power in Syria since at least the 1970s. And the U.S. withdrawal has no doubt consolidated that and elevated Russia’s role in the region. But we shouldn’t overestimate Moscow’s gains.  They now preside over a broken country that will take years and billions to heal. They are shackled with a pariah regime—both entitled and dependent—that will continue to alienate the majority of the Sunni population; they face a resurgent ISIS and are now shackled with responsibility for managing both the Turkish-Syrian-Kurdish triangle and a potential Israeli-Iranian conflict.”“The idea of giving Putin a Nobel Peace Prize sounds ridiculous after years of this dirty war in Syria, the Russian military violating international law, using banned weapons, bombing hospitals and clinics,” Tania Lokshina, Europe and Central Asia associate director at Human Rights Watch Moscow, told The Daily Beast. But still the dream lives on, revived by the agreement moving the Kurds out of the region near the Turkish border. Last week the Russian news agency riafan.ru headlined: “Foreigners propose to award Putin with a Nobel Prize for peace in Syria.” The deadline for Nobel nominations is January 31.

Chris Christie Is Among Lawyers Reaping $15 Million in 1MDB Deal,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:33:49 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/chris-christie-among-lawyers-reaping-133349408.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest recovery ever from an American anti-corruption crackdown is proving lucrative for former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.A major deal struck by the U.S. for fugitive financier Jho Low to give up almost $1 billion in assets allegedly stolen from a Malaysian investment fund comes with a provision to pay his lawyers. As part of the 1MDB settlement, the Justice Department allowed for $15 million to be paid to a group advising Jho Low, including the law firm Christie set up after two terms as New Jersey’s governor.Those proceeds will come from Jho Low’s stake in EMI Music Publishing, which has grown to about $415 million. That investment ballooned after he initially put in a little more than $100 million stolen from 1MDB, according to prosecutors. The two sides agreed to the provision to allow the lawyers to extract fees from Low, whose assets and accounts have been seized or monitored by authorities across the world.“We were pleased to help negotiate this historic resolution in order to preserve the tremendous value of assets involved,” Christie said in a statement after the Justice Department announced the settlement agreement on Wednesday. It still needs approval from a federal judge.Christie, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 before dropping out and endorsing Donald Trump, set up his own law firm last year, the Christie Law Firm LLC. The other firms that will receive proceeds of the 1MDB deal for legal expenses are Kobre & Kim LLP and Lowenstein Sandler LLP.The agreement comes even before the criminal charges against Low have been resolved. In the settlement, the Justice Department cautioned that the released funds should be used only for the Low family’s legal fees and costs related to the lawsuits, and can’t be routed back to Low or his family.To contact the reporter on this story: Sridhar Natarajan in New York at snatarajan15@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

She climbed Everest nine times and set a world record – so why doesn’t she have sponsors?,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 02:00:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/she-climbed-everest-nine-times-060021913.html,"Lhakpa Sherpa works for minimum wages and currently washes dishes, as she trains for her 10th Everest summit with no endorsement deals, no nutritionist and no trainerLhakpa Sherpa in Talcott Mountain state park in Simsbury, Connecticut, where she hikes to prepare for her 10th summit of Everest in the spring of 2020. Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The GuardianI reach Lhakpa Sherpa’s West Hartford apartment at noon on an overcast Sunday in Connecticut. She bounds out of the front door, embraces me, and welcomes me inside. The small apartment is dimly lit. The living room has a few chairs, and a wall of sports medals from her two daughters’ 5Ks and gymnastic meets.Lhakpa was the first Nepalese woman to summit Everest and descend alive, which she accomplished in the spring of 2000. With nine summits, she holds the world record for women. She plans to summit the world’s highest mountain again in the spring of 2020, but as an unsponsored athlete and single mother of three, it’s difficult to afford training and travel. She currently works at Whole Foods washing dishes, making minimum wage. Unable to afford or drive a car, she walks to work and occasionally takes an Uber to training destinations.Sitting in her living room, I’m struck by her achievements – but also her lack of resources. How is it that a woman with such demonstrated accomplishment and skill is without sponsorship, and must risk nearly everything to continue to climb the Himalayan mountains she loves?Lhakpa makes tea while I chat with her 13-year-old daughter, Shiny, who – more fluent in technology and the English language – acts as her mother’s manager and occasional translator.“What’s it like for you,” I ask, “when your mother is away on an expedition?”> I want to show the world I can do it. I want to show women who look like me that they can do it, too.She turns her phone over in her hands. “It’s hard,” she says. “I’m proud of her, but I worry.” Each climbing season, six to 10 climbers die on the mountain.Everest expeditions last upwards of two months, usually in May, and there are only occasional opportunities to communicate via satellite phone and Skype. Avalanches, like the one that hit base camp in 2015, have kept them out of contact for weeks at a time.“I’m very good with the mountain,” Lhakpa says, bringing me a hot cup of tea, offering her warm smile. She has a long, lush ponytail and bright eyes. “I go, but I know I will come home. I have to come home.” She looks reassuringly at Shiny.Lhakpa, 45, grew up in Balakharka, a village in the Makalu region of the Nepalese Himalayas, where her father owned tea houses, and her mother still lives. Lhakpa tells me she isn’t sure of her exact age, as there were no birth certificates, and all of her mother’s 11 children were born at home. As a child, Lhakpa had no electricity, and young girls did not attend school.Lhapka Sherpa prepares tea at her home in West Hartford. Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The Guardian“You see my family on television,” she says. “Sherpas. Climbing Everest.” Her brother Mingma Gelu Sherpa directs an expedition outfitter in Kathmandu. Her oldest brother has summited “10 or 11 times,” she says. Another brother has summited eight times, her youngest brother five, and a sister has summited once.“If there weren’t any Sherpas,” she tells me, “nobody could climb Everest”.She worries when people say that anyone can climb Everest if they have the money – she’s heard people say that it’s just a matter of putting one foot in front of the other, and that Sherpas will do all the work. An average climb with a western outfitter costs upwards of $50,000, while a Nepalese outfitter costs upwards of $30,000.She has seen firsthand all the ways people can die on Everest: avalanches, falls, the thin air of the dead zone. Climbers must occasionally pass bodies, of which there are over a 100 on the mountain. (Bodies are dangerous to take down and doing so requires the effort of at least five sherpas.) Sherpas pass through the Khumbu icefall roughly 40 times just to make sure tourists have the supplies and ropes they need. If you spend enough time in the icefall, she says, you are guaranteed to die.“Why do we do this job?” she asks. “Because the alternative is to make money growing potatoes.”For Lhakpa, to say climbing Everest is easy is an insult. The fact that it is said at all reveals the problematic ways privilege has woven itself into adventure culture.Lhakpa Sherpa and her daughter Shiny, who says of her mother: ‘I’m proud of her, but I worry.’ Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The Guardian•••Serena Williams won the Australian Open while 23 weeks pregnant; Lhakpa Sherpa summited Everest eight months after the birth of her first child, and again while two months pregnant with Shiny.But unlike Williams, Lhakpa has no endorsement deals, no nutritionist, no trainer. She can’t afford to train full time, or much at all, because she works constantly in order to pay her rent.When she leaves her hourly jobs for climbing expeditions, she risks homelessness. When she returns, she picks up as much work as she can, working as a cashier at 7-Eleven and cleaning houses. “I never tell them about Everest,” she says, recounting a time when an employer realized that the woman mopping his floor was a world-renowned athlete.When I approached her for an interview, I asked her if we could hike together. As we prepare to leave for the walk, I notice that the grommet on Lhakpa’s hiking boots is broken, and she struggles to lace them. I’ve seen athletes with lesser accomplishments – but a higher number of Instagram followers – receive impressive amounts of free gear. Lhakpa mentions that her worn, orange Osprey backpack has summited Everest at least twice.Lhakpa Sherpa in 2006, when she broke her own record for the most Everest summits by a woman. Photograph: Prakash Mathema/AFP/GettyIn an era where many organizations profess a desire to diversify outdoors culture, it is difficult to process that such an accomplished athlete – with an authentic connection to the place she climbs - remains unsupported. I presume the root cause is that Lhakpa is not traditionally marketable, and brands want maximum visibility. She doesn’t have a curated Instagram presence. She’s a middle-aged woman of color, an immigrant single mother who speaks in broken English. She doesn’t exude “stoke”. She’s known to climb slowly on the lower slopes, at the advice of the Icefall Doctors, the Sherpas who manage the ropes and ladders over deep crevasses.In person, Lhakpa’s words are laced with intelligence and humor, and her passion for climbing is evident. “This is my gift,” she says of climbing. Though she would have liked to become a doctor or pilot in another life, she knows her talent is getting herself and others on top of some of the world’s largest peaks. Though Black Diamond sponsored an earlier climb, Lhakpa is currently without support.Her dream is to summit Everest in May 2020, followed by K2, a mountain whose summit once eluded her because of inclement weather. She knows this plan is ambitious, if not crazy. “All extreme athletes are crazy,” she says. “But I want to show the world I can do it. I want to show women who look like me that they can do it, too.”•••We take an easy hike on Talcott Mountain, a place she often goes with friends for a quick walk. She occasionally stops to place her hand on a rock face. We talk about the sounds of Everest, particularly the groaning ice. She shows me how she sleeps in a tent on the coldest nights, with her hands clasped underneath her body in the sleeping bag.Lhakpa began climbing in the same way many of her siblings and cousins did, helping an uncle move equipment for tourists on Makalu at 15, serving as a kitchen hand and porter. She says she was a tomboy, and that her mother worried she would never get married. She met her first husband on the mountain, and they moved to the United States in 2002. They often climbed together, until the relationship turned violent.> Climbing is my way out of washing dishes. It is the way to make a better life for the girlsIn 2004, her husband notoriously struck her on Everest, continuing a pattern of abuse that began upon the birth of their first child and continued on expeditions and at home. A difficult few years followed, with the family’s fortunes falling; by 2012 they were on food stamps. After further attacks, hospitalizations, and a stay at a shelter, the couple divorced, and Lhakpa was awarded full custody of the girls.I first learned about Lhakpa years ago, through the story of the 2004 climb, and have thought several times how damaging to her climbing career it must have been. She was forced to endure physical and emotional hardship in front of her professional community, and did not have the ability to control the public narrative. She left her marriage with no financial resources and two dependents. (Her oldest child, Nima, a son from another relationship, is now an adult.) She undoubtedly lost good climbing years to adversity, and yet her commitment to climbing persists.It has always seemed unfair to me to ask female athletes and artists about their marriage and children. Were the “great” male explorers of the past – or even the present – asked as often about how their children are cared for during an adventure, or if it’s OK to take certain risks – but to leave Lhakpa’s marriage and children out of the picture would perhaps be to hide one of her greatest challenges, and most profound motivations.“Climbing is my way out of washing dishes,” Lhakpa tells me. “It is the way to make a better life for the girls.”•••Lhakpa Sherpa: ‘If you don’t trust, you die.’ Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The GuardianAs we walk the well-worn paths of Talcott Mountain back to my car, Shiny becomes concerned about mosquitoes. “I don’t want you to get EEE when you’re out hiking,” she tells Lhakpa. I think about how difficult it must be to process the risks her mother takes, all while knowing her lifetime record of resilient comebacks. They look out for each other. Even when Lhakpa is posing for photographs at an outlook, she has one eye on her youngest daughter, and cautions her against stepping too close to the ridge line.Lhakpa and I talk about the difference between climbing Everest as a Sherpa, and as a climber. One you do for someone else, and the other you do for yourself. She expresses a moving amount of devotion to the clients Sherpas guide to the summit.“You make a promise,” she says, “and you keep it.” Lhakpa talks a lot about trust – trusting herself, trusting the climbing partner she’s tethered to, trusting the mountain. “If you don’t trust,” she says, “you die.”“I’m a small mouse climbing a big mountain,” Lhakpa tells me. Her relationship with the mountain is reverent, as if she’s in conversation with it. “Share with the mountain,” she says. “If you’re scared, your fear scares the mountain.” She even delayed 2019’s planned climb because of her beloved father’s death. “I didn’t want to carry the sadness,” she says. “It would not be safe.”When we get back to the apartment, Lhakpa shows me her boots and insulated Red Fox suit. “I look like a bear,” she says, slipping into the gear, which is reminiscent of a wearable sleeping bag. During climbing season, the temperatures on Everest’s summit range from -4F to -31F.Lhakpa displays the 50-year-old oxygen mask she wears because she says it’s more reliable than the new ones. Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The GuardianShe also wears a 50-year-old oxygen mask, because she believes it’s more reliable than the new ones. “I need smart students,” she says, asking me if I can find someone to design a better mask based on the old models. I picture a group of bright minds at MIT listening to this woman – this expert – who has grown up on the mountain and knows what climbers need as they step into the thin air of Everest.These are the other things Lhakpa wants: sponsorship for her historic 10th climb. Time to train and build her guiding business, Cloudscape Climbing. A life spent on the mountains and not cleaning dishes and taking out trash. A book and documentary about her life. Money to help send her bright daughters to college.“These are not quick dreams,” she adds. “They are long dreams.”Lhakpa has always worked hard to survive, and to subvert expectations. In the past, people have discounted the summits of Sherpas, saying that their familiarity with the altitude and location somehow diminishes the accomplishment. Lhakpa, who dared to step outside of a service culture and climb for herself, wants a 10th summit, and is serious about advancing her record.When I ask Shiny what she admires most about her mother, she pauses. “There is so much,” she says, her voice shaking. “But I would have to say her confidence.”Lhakpa is self-conscious of her hands, dried from washing dishes, and the jobs she must work in order to support her family. She is also driven to inspire others, particularly women and single parents. “I would like to hide in the mountain,” Lhakpa confesses on our descent, aware of her humble circumstances. “But I have to show my face here.”",http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aTsrZU.6T7nrIx0cghr9Rw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/924e3a16db3b93dd3a85bbed5207015e,She climbed Everest nine times and set a world record – so why doesn’t she have sponsors?
India Farmers Plan Nationwide Protest Against 16-Nation Trade Deal,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 08:50:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/india-farmers-plan-nationwide-protest-125007797.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. India’s farmers’ organizations have planned a nationwide protest on Nov. 4 to demand that the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi keep agriculture out of a 16-nation trade agreement currently being negotiated in Thailand.The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, an umbrella organization of about 250 farmers unions from across the country, said that they will burn effigies depicting the China-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership or RCEP, to mark their protest and warn the government.Indian farmers won’t be able to compete should the country agree to cut duties for agricultural and dairy products in the proposed trade pact, said V.M. Singh, a convener of the the farmers’ group. Imports of dairy and agricultural products including wheat, cotton and oil seeds would affect the livelihood of millions of Indian farmers, he said.The government should defer signing of the agreement and hold consultations with farmers, state governments and other stake holders before taking a final decision, said Singh. “We have to stop RCEP,” he said.It is not clear yet what terms India will agree to in order to join what could become the world’s largest trade deal. The final stage of negotiations have begun in Bangkok and Indian trade minister Piyush Goyal will travel for the ministerial meeting there on Nov. 1. The nations are seeking to conclude the negotiations by November end.To contact the reporter on this story: Bibhudatta Pradhan in New Delhi at bpradhan@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ruth Pollard at rpollard2@bloomberg.net, Muneeza Naqvi, Abhay SinghFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GF2o4tZmPCtqpE8IuBOemg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/38b9b9b23d04b76ac5ea78347d209b84,India Farmers Plan Nationwide Protest Against 16-Nation Trade Deal

No one seemed to miss the teen, dubbed the ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe,’ and, for the last 40 years, that is as far as the case went–until now.This summer Clark County detectives decided to post a DNA sample from the old remains to the Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, a public genealogy database that has had recent success closing old cold cases. The lab found a tie to a distant cousin of a teen named Sandra “Sandy” Renee Morden who said she was last seen in 1977–three years before her skeletal remains were found. Courtesy of Clark County SheriffThe Oregonian then dug up an old birthday announcement that was tied to the case. On April 29, 1977, in the classified section of the paper, a tiny ad appeared that said: “Sandra Renee Morden, Happy 15th Birthday. Love Always—Mom.” Such published greetings were a common way to mark a birthday or anniversary in the era before Facebook and other social media. Morden’s parents were divorced, according to the DNA-linked cousin, who does not want to be named and who provided Clark County cold-case detective Lindsay Schultz with the only clues the teen’s life. Schultz told the Oregonian that Morden was a “latchkey kid” who was mostly “unsupervised.” There is no indication that the parents filed a missing persons report, and, as Schultz says, “We didn’t have [the National Crime Information Center] at that time.” The detective says Morden’s parents came from the San Francisco area and settled in Portland. They split up in the early 1970s, and did not communicate with each other. The girl’s mother, identified as Kathryn Irene Morden, apparently lost custody and the cousin said Sandy most often stayed with her father, identified as Andrew Bain Morden, a Marine Corps veteran who fought in the Korean War. Schultz says she likely fell through the cracks when one parent thought the other had her. She last attended Wilson High School in Portland. Schultz told the Oregonian that the father likely thought she was with her mother. He had left her alone for an extended period of time and when he came back, she was gone, so he assumed she had gone to her mother’s home. “We don’t know for certain,” Schultz says. “We know that’s what family members believe.”Both parents are dead, so there is no way to confirm what either of them knew. Schultz told the Oregonian that it is the birthday greeting that bothers him most. It was posted around the time the extended family says she disappeared. “Was it just a mom who loved her daughter–or did her mom know something and put it out there for that reason?” Schultz said. “It’s one of those two, right? You ponder it. You look at it and you think, ‘What does it mean?’”Now detectives are looking for the missing puzzle pieces. They are calling on anyone who might have any information about Morden, her parents, or how she might have died to contact the Clark County Medical Examiner's Office or Clark County Sheriff's Office Cold Case Tip Line.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

A Nobel Peace Prize for Vladimir Putin? That’s the Talk in Moscow.,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 05:40:49 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/nobel-peace-prize-vladimir-putin-094049080.html,"Adam Berry/GettyMOSCOW—For those who live outside Russia and the enormous bubble of admiration inflated around President Vladimir Putin, this story may be a bit hard to believe. But there is a movement afoot here, apparently in all sincerity, to nominate Putin for the Nobel Peace Prize.From the outside, one must wonder how the dossier for the former KGB operative might be prepared. Would it include the peace of the grave imposed on civilians in the Second Chechen War early in Putin’s presidency? Or would it be for backing quasi states broken away from the Republic of Georgia? Or, more recently, for the forcible annexation of Crimea and the instigation of a separatist war in Ukraine that continues to this day? Alex Gibney: How Donald Trump Is Morphing Into Vladimir PutinOr perhaps he’d win for Syria, where Putin is a strong supporter of the Assad dictatorship that has killed hundreds of thousands of people while half of the nation’s population has been driven into internal or external exile. Would that be the venue for Putin the peacemaker to earn his Nobel laurels?In fact, through the looking glass of Moscow’s media and Putin’s supporters, Ukraine and Syria are held up as prime examples of his eligibility for The Prize.The general secretary of the Russian-Turkish Public Forum, Sergey Markov, who is close to the Kremlin, tells The Daily Beast that there is no better candidate for the prestigious award than Putin: “Most Russian state officials believe that President Putin deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for saving the world from a nuclear war during the crisis in Ukraine in 2014—for holding back and not bringing Russian forces to Kharkiv, Dnepropetrovsk, [Ukrainian] cities full of Russian people,” Markov said, adding, “Of course Putin should be given the prize for solving the Turkish-Kurdish conflict, which risked taking thousands of lives.” Forget U.S. President Donald Trump’s efforts to claim credit for a ceasefire deal with Ankara, Putin’s supporters in Moscow believe that it was Putin alone who managed to find the solution and negotiate a deal with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that prevented a Turkish-Kurdish bloodbath. Whoever is responsible, the arrangement is essentially on Erdogan’s terms, opening the way for ethnic cleansing as Kurdish troops withdraw, Kurdish civilians flee, and Erdogan plans to move millions of Syrian Arabs, most of them from other parts of the country, into what Erdogan calls a “safe zone.”Yet Aleksey Venediktov, editor-in-chief of the influential independent radio station Echo of Moscow, tweeted last week as that deal came down: “They tell me at the top: ‘Now you understand, Putin deserves a Nobel Peace Prize.’” He said his high-level sources were telling him Putin’s Syria deal was like “the new Camp David Accord,” putting it on a par with the 1978 agreement brokered by President Jimmy Carter that ended generations of war between Israel and Egypt. In truth, the Russian leader has been looking to win The Prize for years. Ever since Time magazine put Putin on the cover as Person of the Year in 2007, the Kremlin’s ideologues have believed that the West recognizes Putin as the world’s preeminent politician—and peacemaker—and no wars in Georgia, Ukraine or Syria could dissuade them.Putin’s greatest accomplishment on that score probably came in 2013 when President Barack Obama was weighing the possibility of major military strikes on the Bashar al-Assad regime to retaliate for its use of chemical weapons, and Putin stepped in with a better—or at least more peaceful—plan. He persuaded Assad, first, to admit he had a chemical arsenal, which he had never done before. Then Assad agreed to U.N. inspections as he eliminated everything he admitted to having, and by all accounts the vast majority of those gruesome weapons were destroyed. At the time, that seemed like a major war averted, and therefore a pathway to peace.So at the beginning of 2014 a Russian advocacy group called the International Academy of Spiritual Unity and Cooperation of People put Putin up for the prize.Unfortunately for Putin’s aspirations, there’s quite a long delay between the nominations at the beginning of the year, and the awards at the end, and Putin was not exactly making peace in 2014. Reacting to a popular pro-European, largely anti-Russian uprising in Ukraine, he seized the Crimean Peninsula, annexed it to Russia, and poured support into separatist rebels in Eastern Ukraine. The death toll soon climbed into the thousands, with hundreds of thousands of people displaced. In July 2014 a Russian-supplied missile shot down a Malaysian Airliner en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur with 298 people on board, all of whom died.If anyone argued in 2014, as Markov suggests, that Putin should have gotten a peace prize for not staging a massive, direct invasion of Ukraine to take the large cities of Kharkiv and Dnepropetrovsk, the Nobel Committee in Norway clearly was not persuaded. It gave the 2014 prize to Kailash Satyarthi and Malala Yousafzai ""for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education.""Russia’s record in Syria has been equally bloody since it entered the fight directly to support Assad in 2015.  One recent example was a Russian-Syrian military strike on a center for hundreds of displaced people in the town of Haas in Idlib that killed 20 civilians in August. A Human Rights Watch investigation published in October qualified the attack as “an apparent war crime.” Sara Kayyali who monitors the violations on the ground for HRW, tells The Daily Beast that “Russian strikes on protected humanitarian infrastructure” have been common in the areas where they operate, with “severely negative consequences.”Now, says Kayyali, “Russia has brokered an agreement with Turkey around a so-called ‘safe zone,’ but as history has proved again and again, safe zones are rarely safe.” President Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov gloated last week, saying, ""The United States was the closest ally of the Kurds during the last few years, and in the end the U.S. ditched the Kurds and effectively betrayed them."" By arranging for the withdrawal of the fighters, Peskov suggested, Russia is at least saving their lives. The United States looks foolish and treacherous, to be sure. But some analysts suggest Russia’s schadenfreude is premature. David Aaron Miller at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace notes that among some in Washington, “Animosity toward Trump and Putin—richly deserved—is clouding the analysis on Syria  and triggering overreaction about Russia’s gains.”As Miller points out, “Russia has been the dominant external power in Syria since at least the 1970s. And the U.S. withdrawal has no doubt consolidated that and elevated Russia’s role in the region. But we shouldn’t overestimate Moscow’s gains.  They now preside over a broken country that will take years and billions to heal. They are shackled with a pariah regime—both entitled and dependent—that will continue to alienate the majority of the Sunni population; they face a resurgent ISIS and are now shackled with responsibility for managing both the Turkish-Syrian-Kurdish triangle and a potential Israeli-Iranian conflict.”“The idea of giving Putin a Nobel Peace Prize sounds ridiculous after years of this dirty war in Syria, the Russian military violating international law, using banned weapons, bombing hospitals and clinics,” Tania Lokshina, Europe and Central Asia associate director at Human Rights Watch Moscow, told The Daily Beast. But still the dream lives on, revived by the agreement moving the Kurds out of the region near the Turkish border. Last week the Russian news agency riafan.ru headlined: “Foreigners propose to award Putin with a Nobel Prize for peace in Syria.” The deadline for Nobel nominations is January 31. One can only guess at the peace initiatives Putin will carry out between now and then.Is Trump Saving Those Syrian Oil Fields for the Russians?Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Chris Christie Is Among Lawyers Reaping $15 Million in 1MDB Deal,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:33:49 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/chris-christie-among-lawyers-reaping-133349408.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest recovery ever from an American anti-corruption crackdown is proving lucrative for former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.A major deal struck by the U.S. for fugitive financier Jho Low to give up almost $1 billion in assets allegedly stolen from a Malaysian investment fund comes with a provision to pay his lawyers. As part of the 1MDB settlement, the Justice Department allowed for $15 million to be paid to a group advising Jho Low, including the law firm Christie set up after two terms as New Jersey’s governor.Those proceeds will come from Jho Low’s stake in EMI Music Publishing, which has grown to about $415 million. That investment ballooned after he initially put in a little more than $100 million stolen from 1MDB, according to prosecutors. The two sides agreed to the provision to allow the lawyers to extract fees from Low, whose assets and accounts have been seized or monitored by authorities across the world.“We were pleased to help negotiate this historic resolution in order to preserve the tremendous value of assets involved,” Christie said in a statement after the Justice Department announced the settlement agreement on Wednesday. It still needs approval from a federal judge.Christie, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 before dropping out and endorsing Donald Trump, set up his own law firm last year, the Christie Law Firm LLC. The other firms that will receive proceeds of the 1MDB deal for legal expenses are Kobre & Kim LLP and Lowenstein Sandler LLP.The agreement comes even before the criminal charges against Low have been resolved. In the settlement, the Justice Department cautioned that the released funds should be used only for the Low family’s legal fees and costs related to the lawsuits, and can’t be routed back to Low or his family.To contact the reporter on this story: Sridhar Natarajan in New York at snatarajan15@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

She climbed Everest nine times and set a world record – so why doesn’t she have sponsors?,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 02:00:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/she-climbed-everest-nine-times-060021913.html,"Lhakpa Sherpa works for minimum wages and currently washes dishes, as she trains for her 10th Everest summit with no endorsement deals, no nutritionist and no trainerLhakpa Sherpa in Talcott Mountain state park in Simsbury, Connecticut, where she hikes to prepare for her 10th summit of Everest in the spring of 2020. Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The GuardianI reach Lhakpa Sherpa’s West Hartford apartment at noon on an overcast Sunday in Connecticut. She bounds out of the front door, embraces me, and welcomes me inside. The small apartment is dimly lit. The living room has a few chairs, and a wall of sports medals from her two daughters’ 5Ks and gymnastic meets.Lhakpa was the first Nepalese woman to summit Everest and descend alive, which she accomplished in the spring of 2000. With nine summits, she holds the world record for women. She plans to summit the world’s highest mountain again in the spring of 2020, but as an unsponsored athlete and single mother of three, it’s difficult to afford training and travel. She currently works at Whole Foods washing dishes, making minimum wage. Unable to afford or drive a car, she walks to work and occasionally takes an Uber to training destinations.Sitting in her living room, I’m struck by her achievements – but also her lack of resources. How is it that a woman with such demonstrated accomplishment and skill is without sponsorship, and must risk nearly everything to continue to climb the Himalayan mountains she loves?Lhakpa makes tea while I chat with her 13-year-old daughter, Shiny, who – more fluent in technology and the English language – acts as her mother’s manager and occasional translator.“What’s it like for you,” I ask, “when your mother is away on an expedition?”> I want to show the world I can do it. I want to show women who look like me that they can do it, too.She turns her phone over in her hands. “It’s hard,” she says. “I’m proud of her, but I worry.” Each climbing season, six to 10 climbers die on the mountain.Everest expeditions last upwards of two months, usually in May, and there are only occasional opportunities to communicate via satellite phone and Skype. Avalanches, like the one that hit base camp in 2015, have kept them out of contact for weeks at a time.“I’m very good with the mountain,” Lhakpa says, bringing me a hot cup of tea, offering her warm smile. She has a long, lush ponytail and bright eyes. “I go, but I know I will come home. I have to come home.” She looks reassuringly at Shiny.Lhakpa, 45, grew up in Balakharka, a village in the Makalu region of the Nepalese Himalayas, where her father owned tea houses, and her mother still lives. Lhakpa tells me she isn’t sure of her exact age, as there were no birth certificates, and all of her mother’s 11 children were born at home. As a child, Lhakpa had no electricity, and young girls did not attend school.Lhapka Sherpa prepares tea at her home in West Hartford. Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The Guardian“You see my family on television,” she says. “Sherpas. Climbing Everest.” Her brother Mingma Gelu Sherpa directs an expedition outfitter in Kathmandu. Her oldest brother has summited “10 or 11 times,” she says. Another brother has summited eight times, her youngest brother five, and a sister has summited once.“If there weren’t any Sherpas,” she tells me, “nobody could climb Everest”.She worries when people say that anyone can climb Everest if they have the money – she’s heard people say that it’s just a matter of putting one foot in front of the other, and that Sherpas will do all the work. An average climb with a western outfitter costs upwards of $50,000, while a Nepalese outfitter costs upwards of $30,000.She has seen firsthand all the ways people can die on Everest: avalanches, falls, the thin air of the dead zone. Climbers must occasionally pass bodies, of which there are over a 100 on the mountain. (Bodies are dangerous to take down and doing so requires the effort of at least five sherpas.) Sherpas pass through the Khumbu icefall roughly 40 times just to make sure tourists have the supplies and ropes they need. If you spend enough time in the icefall, she says, you are guaranteed to die.“Why do we do this job?” she asks. “Because the alternative is to make money growing potatoes.”For Lhakpa, to say climbing Everest is easy is an insult. The fact that it is said at all reveals the problematic ways privilege has woven itself into adventure culture.Lhakpa Sherpa and her daughter Shiny, who says of her mother: ‘I’m proud of her, but I worry.’ Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The Guardian•••Serena Williams won the Australian Open while 23 weeks pregnant; Lhakpa Sherpa summited Everest eight months after the birth of her first child, and again while two months pregnant with Shiny.But unlike Williams, Lhakpa has no endorsement deals, no nutritionist, no trainer. She can’t afford to train full time, or much at all, because she works constantly in order to pay her rent.When she leaves her hourly jobs for climbing expeditions, she risks homelessness. When she returns, she picks up as much work as she can, working as a cashier at 7-Eleven and cleaning houses. “I never tell them about Everest,” she says, recounting a time when an employer realized that the woman mopping his floor was a world-renowned athlete.When I approached her for an interview, I asked her if we could hike together. As we prepare to leave for the walk, I notice that the grommet on Lhakpa’s hiking boots is broken, and she struggles to lace them. I’ve seen athletes with lesser accomplishments – but a higher number of Instagram followers – receive impressive amounts of free gear. Lhakpa mentions that her worn, orange Osprey backpack has summited Everest at least twice.Lhakpa Sherpa in 2006, when she broke her own record for the most Everest summits by a woman. Photograph: Prakash Mathema/AFP/GettyIn an era where many organizations profess a desire to diversify outdoors culture, it is difficult to process that such an accomplished athlete – with an authentic connection to the place she climbs - remains unsupported. I presume the root cause is that Lhakpa is not traditionally marketable, and brands want maximum visibility. She doesn’t have a curated Instagram presence. She’s a middle-aged woman of color, an immigrant single mother who speaks in broken English. She doesn’t exude “stoke”. She’s known to climb slowly on the lower slopes, at the advice of the Icefall Doctors, the Sherpas who manage the ropes and ladders over deep crevasses.In person, Lhakpa’s words are laced with intelligence and humor, and her passion for climbing is evident. “This is my gift,” she says of climbing. Though she would have liked to become a doctor or pilot in another life, she knows her talent is getting herself and others on top of some of the world’s largest peaks. Though Black Diamond sponsored an earlier climb, Lhakpa is currently without support.Her dream is to summit Everest in May 2020, followed by K2, a mountain whose summit once eluded her because of inclement weather. She knows this plan is ambitious, if not crazy. “All extreme athletes are crazy,” she says. “But I want to show the world I can do it. I want to show women who look like me that they can do it, too.”•••We take an easy hike on Talcott Mountain, a place she often goes with friends for a quick walk. She occasionally stops to place her hand on a rock face. We talk about the sounds of Everest, particularly the groaning ice. She shows me how she sleeps in a tent on the coldest nights, with her hands clasped underneath her body in the sleeping bag.Lhakpa began climbing in the same way many of her siblings and cousins did, helping an uncle move equipment for tourists on Makalu at 15, serving as a kitchen hand and porter. She says she was a tomboy, and that her mother worried she would never get married. She met her first husband on the mountain, and they moved to the United States in 2002. They often climbed together, until the relationship turned violent.> Climbing is my way out of washing dishes. It is the way to make a better life for the girlsIn 2004, her husband notoriously struck her on Everest, continuing a pattern of abuse that began upon the birth of their first child and continued on expeditions and at home. A difficult few years followed, with the family’s fortunes falling; by 2012 they were on food stamps. After further attacks, hospitalizations, and a stay at a shelter, the couple divorced, and Lhakpa was awarded full custody of the girls.I first learned about Lhakpa years ago, through the story of the 2004 climb, and have thought several times how damaging to her climbing career it must have been. She was forced to endure physical and emotional hardship in front of her professional community, and did not have the ability to control the public narrative. She left her marriage with no financial resources and two dependents. (Her oldest child, Nima, a son from another relationship, is now an adult.) She undoubtedly lost good climbing years to adversity, and yet her commitment to climbing persists.It has always seemed unfair to me to ask female athletes and artists about their marriage and children. Were the “great” male explorers of the past – or even the present – asked as often about how their children are cared for during an adventure, or if it’s OK to take certain risks – but to leave Lhakpa’s marriage and children out of the picture would perhaps be to hide one of her greatest challenges, and most profound motivations.“Climbing is my way out of washing dishes,” Lhakpa tells me. “It is the way to make a better life for the girls.”•••Lhakpa Sherpa: ‘If you don’t trust, you die.’ Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The GuardianAs we walk the well-worn paths of Talcott Mountain back to my car, Shiny becomes concerned about mosquitoes. “I don’t want you to get EEE when you’re out hiking,” she tells Lhakpa. I think about how difficult it must be to process the risks her mother takes, all while knowing her lifetime record of resilient comebacks. They look out for each other. Even when Lhakpa is posing for photographs at an outlook, she has one eye on her youngest daughter, and cautions her against stepping too close to the ridge line.Lhakpa and I talk about the difference between climbing Everest as a Sherpa, and as a climber. One you do for someone else, and the other you do for yourself. She expresses a moving amount of devotion to the clients Sherpas guide to the summit.“You make a promise,” she says, “and you keep it.” Lhakpa talks a lot about trust – trusting herself, trusting the climbing partner she’s tethered to, trusting the mountain. “If you don’t trust,” she says, “you die.”“I’m a small mouse climbing a big mountain,” Lhakpa tells me. Her relationship with the mountain is reverent, as if she’s in conversation with it. “Share with the mountain,” she says. “If you’re scared, your fear scares the mountain.” She even delayed 2019’s planned climb because of her beloved father’s death. “I didn’t want to carry the sadness,” she says. “It would not be safe.”When we get back to the apartment, Lhakpa shows me her boots and insulated Red Fox suit. “I look like a bear,” she says, slipping into the gear, which is reminiscent of a wearable sleeping bag. During climbing season, the temperatures on Everest’s summit range from -4F to -31F.Lhakpa displays the 50-year-old oxygen mask she wears because she says it’s more reliable than the new ones. Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The GuardianShe also wears a 50-year-old oxygen mask, because she believes it’s more reliable than the new ones. “I need smart students,” she says, asking me if I can find someone to design a better mask based on the old models. I picture a group of bright minds at MIT listening to this woman – this expert – who has grown up on the mountain and knows what climbers need as they step into the thin air of Everest.These are the other things Lhakpa wants: sponsorship for her historic 10th climb. Time to train and build her guiding business, Cloudscape Climbing. A life spent on the mountains and not cleaning dishes and taking out trash. A book and documentary about her life. Money to help send her bright daughters to college.“These are not quick dreams,” she adds. “They are long dreams.”Lhakpa has always worked hard to survive, and to subvert expectations. In the past, people have discounted the summits of Sherpas, saying that their familiarity with the altitude and location somehow diminishes the accomplishment. Lhakpa, who dared to step outside of a service culture and climb for herself, wants a 10th summit, and is serious about advancing her record.When I ask Shiny what she admires most about her mother, she pauses. “There is so much,” she says, her voice shaking. “But I would have to say her confidence.”Lhakpa is self-conscious of her hands, dried from washing dishes, and the jobs she must work in order to support her family. She is also driven to inspire others, particularly women and single parents. “I would like to hide in the mountain,” Lhakpa confesses on our descent, aware of her humble circumstances. “But I have to show my face here.”",http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aTsrZU.6T7nrIx0cghr9Rw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/924e3a16db3b93dd3a85bbed5207015e,She climbed Everest nine times and set a world record – so why doesn’t she have sponsors?
India Farmers Plan Nationwide Protest Against 16-Nation Trade Deal,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 08:50:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/india-farmers-plan-nationwide-protest-125007797.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. India’s farmers’ organizations have planned a nationwide protest on Nov. 4 to demand that the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi keep agriculture out of a 16-nation trade agreement currently being negotiated in Thailand.The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, an umbrella organization of about 250 farmers unions from across the country, said that they will burn effigies depicting the China-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership or RCEP, to mark their protest and warn the government.Indian farmers won’t be able to compete should the country agree to cut duties for agricultural and dairy products in the proposed trade pact, said V.M. Singh, a convener of the the farmers’ group. Imports of dairy and agricultural products including wheat, cotton and oil seeds would affect the livelihood of millions of Indian farmers, he said.The government should defer signing of the agreement and hold consultations with farmers, state governments and other stake holders before taking a final decision, said Singh. “We have to stop RCEP,” he said.It is not clear yet what terms India will agree to in order to join what could become the world’s largest trade deal. The final stage of negotiations have begun in Bangkok and Indian trade minister Piyush Goyal will travel for the ministerial meeting there on Nov. 1. The nations are seeking to conclude the negotiations by November end.To contact the reporter on this story: Bibhudatta Pradhan in New Delhi at bpradhan@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ruth Pollard at rpollard2@bloomberg.net, Muneeza Naqvi, Abhay SinghFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GF2o4tZmPCtqpE8IuBOemg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/38b9b9b23d04b76ac5ea78347d209b84,India Farmers Plan Nationwide Protest Against 16-Nation Trade Deal

Authorities Identify ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe’ Through DNA and Now the Real Questions Start,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:13:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/authorities-identify-fly-creek-jane-131307745.html,"On a chilly February Sunday in 1980, a father and son panning for gold along Fly Creek in Clark County, Washington, kicked up the remains of a human skeleton that appeared to have been buried in a shallow grave. They called the authorities who came to collect the skull and what bones hadn’t been dragged away by animals, and were able to use the remains to construct a facial reconstruction that produced a picture of a teenage girl. Detectives were able to deduce that she died from a cause that did not seem natural. Calls for information, searches through missing persons reports, and detective work turned up nothing. No one seemed to miss the teen, dubbed the ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe,’ and, for the last 40 years, that is as far as the case went–until now.This summer Clark County detectives decided to post a DNA sample from the old remains to the Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, a public genealogy database that has had recent success closing old cold cases. The lab found a tie to a distant cousin of a teen named Sandra “Sandy” Renee Morden who said she was last seen in 1977–three years before her skeletal remains were found. Courtesy of Clark County SheriffThe Oregonian then dug up an old birthday announcement that was tied to the case. On April 29, 1977, in the classified section of the paper, a tiny ad appeared that said: “Sandra Renee Morden, Happy 15th Birthday. Love Always—Mom.” Such published greetings were a common way to mark a birthday or anniversary in the era before Facebook and other social media. Morden’s parents were divorced, according to the DNA-linked cousin, who does not want to be named and who provided Clark County cold-case detective Lindsay Schultz with the only clues the teen’s life. Schultz told the Oregonian that Morden was a “latchkey kid” who was mostly “unsupervised.” There is no indication that the parents filed a missing persons report, and, as Schultz says, “We didn’t have [the National Crime Information Center] at that time.” The detective says Morden’s parents came from the San Francisco area and settled in Portland. They split up in the early 1970s, and did not communicate with each other. The girl’s mother, identified as Kathryn Irene Morden, apparently lost custody and the cousin said Sandy most often stayed with her father, identified as Andrew Bain Morden, a Marine Corps veteran who fought in the Korean War. Schultz says she likely fell through the cracks when one parent thought the other had her. She last attended Wilson High School in Portland. Schultz told the Oregonian that the father likely thought she was with her mother. He had left her alone for an extended period of time and when he came back, she was gone, so he assumed she had gone to her mother’s home. “We don’t know for certain,” Schultz says. “We know that’s what family members believe.”Both parents are dead, so there is no way to confirm what either of them knew. Schultz told the Oregonian that it is the birthday greeting that bothers him most. It was posted around the time the extended family says she disappeared. “Was it just a mom who loved her daughter–or did her mom know something and put it out there for that reason?” Schultz said. “It’s one of those two, right? You ponder it. You look at it and you think, ‘What does it mean?’”Now detectives are looking for the missing puzzle pieces. They are calling on anyone who might have any information about Morden, her parents, or how she might have died to contact the Clark County Medical Examiner's Office or Clark County Sheriff's Office Cold Case Tip Line.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

A Nobel Peace Prize for Vladimir Putin? That’s the Talk in Moscow.,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 05:40:49 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/nobel-peace-prize-vladimir-putin-094049080.html,"Adam Berry/GettyMOSCOW—For those who live outside Russia and the enormous bubble of admiration inflated around President Vladimir Putin, this story may be a bit hard to believe. But there is a movement afoot here, apparently in all sincerity, to nominate Putin for the Nobel Peace Prize.From the outside, one must wonder how the dossier for the former KGB operative might be prepared. Would it include the peace of the grave imposed on civilians in the Second Chechen War early in Putin’s presidency? Or would it be for backing quasi states broken away from the Republic of Georgia? Or, more recently, for the forcible annexation of Crimea and the instigation of a separatist war in Ukraine that continues to this day? Alex Gibney: How Donald Trump Is Morphing Into Vladimir PutinOr perhaps he’d win for Syria, where Putin is a strong supporter of the Assad dictatorship that has killed hundreds of thousands of people while half of the nation’s population has been driven into internal or external exile. Would that be the venue for Putin the peacemaker to earn his Nobel laurels?In fact, through the looking glass of Moscow’s media and Putin’s supporters, Ukraine and Syria are held up as prime examples of his eligibility for The Prize.The general secretary of the Russian-Turkish Public Forum, Sergey Markov, who is close to the Kremlin, tells The Daily Beast that there is no better candidate for the prestigious award than Putin: “Most Russian state officials believe that President Putin deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for saving the world from a nuclear war during the crisis in Ukraine in 2014—for holding back and not bringing Russian forces to Kharkiv, Dnepropetrovsk, [Ukrainian] cities full of Russian people,” Markov said, adding, “Of course Putin should be given the prize for solving the Turkish-Kurdish conflict, which risked taking thousands of lives.” Forget U.S. President Donald Trump’s efforts to claim credit for a ceasefire deal with Ankara, Putin’s supporters in Moscow believe that it was Putin alone who managed to find the solution and negotiate a deal with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that prevented a Turkish-Kurdish bloodbath. Whoever is responsible, the arrangement is essentially on Erdogan’s terms, opening the way for ethnic cleansing as Kurdish troops withdraw, Kurdish civilians flee, and Erdogan plans to move millions of Syrian Arabs, most of them from other parts of the country, into what Erdogan calls a “safe zone.”Yet Aleksey Venediktov, editor-in-chief of the influential independent radio station Echo of Moscow, tweeted last week as that deal came down: “They tell me at the top: ‘Now you understand, Putin deserves a Nobel Peace Prize.’” He said his high-level sources were telling him Putin’s Syria deal was like “the new Camp David Accord,” putting it on a par with the 1978 agreement brokered by President Jimmy Carter that ended generations of war between Israel and Egypt. In truth, the Russian leader has been looking to win The Prize for years. Ever since Time magazine put Putin on the cover as Person of the Year in 2007, the Kremlin’s ideologues have believed that the West recognizes Putin as the world’s preeminent politician—and peacemaker—and no wars in Georgia, Ukraine or Syria could dissuade them.Putin’s greatest accomplishment on that score probably came in 2013 when President Barack Obama was weighing the possibility of major military strikes on the Bashar al-Assad regime to retaliate for its use of chemical weapons, and Putin stepped in with a better—or at least more peaceful—plan. He persuaded Assad, first, to admit he had a chemical arsenal, which he had never done before. Then Assad agreed to U.N. inspections as he eliminated everything he admitted to having, and by all accounts the vast majority of those gruesome weapons were destroyed. At the time, that seemed like a major war averted, and therefore a pathway to peace.So at the beginning of 2014 a Russian advocacy group called the International Academy of Spiritual Unity and Cooperation of People put Putin up for the prize.Unfortunately for Putin’s aspirations, there’s quite a long delay between the nominations at the beginning of the year, and the awards at the end, and Putin was not exactly making peace in 2014. Reacting to a popular pro-European, largely anti-Russian uprising in Ukraine, he seized the Crimean Peninsula, annexed it to Russia, and poured support into separatist rebels in Eastern Ukraine. The death toll soon climbed into the thousands, with hundreds of thousands of people displaced. In July 2014 a Russian-supplied missile shot down a Malaysian Airliner en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur with 298 people on board, all of whom died.If anyone argued in 2014, as Markov suggests, that Putin should have gotten a peace prize for not staging a massive, direct invasion of Ukraine to take the large cities of Kharkiv and Dnepropetrovsk, the Nobel Committee in Norway clearly was not persuaded. It gave the 2014 prize to Kailash Satyarthi and Malala Yousafzai ""for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education.""Russia’s record in Syria has been equally bloody since it entered the fight directly to support Assad in 2015.  One recent example was a Russian-Syrian military strike on a center for hundreds of displaced people in the town of Haas in Idlib that killed 20 civilians in August. A Human Rights Watch investigation published in October qualified the attack as “an apparent war crime.” Sara Kayyali who monitors the violations on the ground for HRW, tells The Daily Beast that “Russian strikes on protected humanitarian infrastructure” have been common in the areas where they operate, with “severely negative consequences.”Now, says Kayyali, “Russia has brokered an agreement with Turkey around a so-called ‘safe zone,’ but as history has proved again and again, safe zones are rarely safe.” President Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov gloated last week, saying, ""The United States was the closest ally of the Kurds during the last few years, and in the end the U.S. ditched the Kurds and effectively betrayed them."" By arranging for the withdrawal of the fighters, Peskov suggested, Russia is at least saving their lives. The United States looks foolish and treacherous, to be sure. But some analysts suggest Russia’s schadenfreude is premature. David Aaron Miller at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace notes that among some in Washington, “Animosity toward Trump and Putin—richly deserved—is clouding the analysis on Syria  and triggering overreaction about Russia’s gains.”As Miller points out, “Russia has been the dominant external power in Syria since at least the 1970s. And the U.S. withdrawal has no doubt consolidated that and elevated Russia’s role in the region. But we shouldn’t overestimate Moscow’s gains.  They now preside over a broken country that will take years and billions to heal. They are shackled with a pariah regime—both entitled and dependent—that will continue to alienate the majority of the Sunni population; they face a resurgent ISIS and are now shackled with responsibility for managing both the Turkish-Syrian-Kurdish triangle and a potential Israeli-Iranian conflict.”“The idea of giving Putin a Nobel Peace Prize sounds ridiculous after years of this dirty war in Syria, the Russian military violating international law, using banned weapons, bombing hospitals and clinics,” Tania Lokshina, Europe and Central Asia associate director at Human Rights Watch Moscow, told The Daily Beast. But still the dream lives on, revived by the agreement moving the Kurds out of the region near the Turkish border. Last week the Russian news agency riafan.ru headlined: “Foreigners propose to award Putin with a Nobel Prize for peace in Syria.” The deadline for Nobel nominations is January 31. One can only guess at the peace initiatives Putin will carry out between now and then.Is Trump Saving Those Syrian Oil Fields for the Russians?Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Chris Christie Is Among Lawyers Reaping $15 Million in 1MDB Deal,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:33:49 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/chris-christie-among-lawyers-reaping-133349408.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest recovery ever from an American anti-corruption crackdown is proving lucrative for former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.A major deal struck by the U.S. for fugitive financier Jho Low to give up almost $1 billion in assets allegedly stolen from a Malaysian investment fund comes with a provision to pay his lawyers. As part of the 1MDB settlement, the Justice Department allowed for $15 million to be paid to a group advising Jho Low, including the law firm Christie set up after two terms as New Jersey’s governor.Those proceeds will come from Jho Low’s stake in EMI Music Publishing, which has grown to about $415 million. That investment ballooned after he initially put in a little more than $100 million stolen from 1MDB, according to prosecutors. The two sides agreed to the provision to allow the lawyers to extract fees from Low, whose assets and accounts have been seized or monitored by authorities across the world.“We were pleased to help negotiate this historic resolution in order to preserve the tremendous value of assets involved,” Christie said in a statement after the Justice Department announced the settlement agreement on Wednesday. It still needs approval from a federal judge.Christie, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 before dropping out and endorsing Donald Trump, set up his own law firm last year, the Christie Law Firm LLC. The other firms that will receive proceeds of the 1MDB deal for legal expenses are Kobre & Kim LLP and Lowenstein Sandler LLP.The agreement comes even before the criminal charges against Low have been resolved. In the settlement, the Justice Department cautioned that the released funds should be used only for the Low family’s legal fees and costs related to the lawsuits, and can’t be routed back to Low or his family.To contact the reporter on this story: Sridhar Natarajan in New York at snatarajan15@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

She climbed Everest nine times and set a world record – so why doesn’t she have sponsors?,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 02:00:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/she-climbed-everest-nine-times-060021913.html,"Lhakpa Sherpa works for minimum wages and currently washes dishes, as she trains for her 10th Everest summit with no endorsement deals, no nutritionist and no trainerLhakpa Sherpa in Talcott Mountain state park in Simsbury, Connecticut, where she hikes to prepare for her 10th summit of Everest in the spring of 2020. Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The GuardianI reach Lhakpa Sherpa’s West Hartford apartment at noon on an overcast Sunday in Connecticut. She bounds out of the front door, embraces me, and welcomes me inside. The small apartment is dimly lit. The living room has a few chairs, and a wall of sports medals from her two daughters’ 5Ks and gymnastic meets.Lhakpa was the first Nepalese woman to summit Everest and descend alive, which she accomplished in the spring of 2000. With nine summits, she holds the world record for women. She plans to summit the world’s highest mountain again in the spring of 2020, but as an unsponsored athlete and single mother of three, it’s difficult to afford training and travel. She currently works at Whole Foods washing dishes, making minimum wage. Unable to afford or drive a car, she walks to work and occasionally takes an Uber to training destinations.Sitting in her living room, I’m struck by her achievements – but also her lack of resources. How is it that a woman with such demonstrated accomplishment and skill is without sponsorship, and must risk nearly everything to continue to climb the Himalayan mountains she loves?Lhakpa makes tea while I chat with her 13-year-old daughter, Shiny, who – more fluent in technology and the English language – acts as her mother’s manager and occasional translator.“What’s it like for you,” I ask, “when your mother is away on an expedition?”> I want to show the world I can do it. I want to show women who look like me that they can do it, too.She turns her phone over in her hands. “It’s hard,” she says. “I’m proud of her, but I worry.” Each climbing season, six to 10 climbers die on the mountain.Everest expeditions last upwards of two months, usually in May, and there are only occasional opportunities to communicate via satellite phone and Skype. Avalanches, like the one that hit base camp in 2015, have kept them out of contact for weeks at a time.“I’m very good with the mountain,” Lhakpa says, bringing me a hot cup of tea, offering her warm smile. She has a long, lush ponytail and bright eyes. “I go, but I know I will come home. I have to come home.” She looks reassuringly at Shiny.Lhakpa, 45, grew up in Balakharka, a village in the Makalu region of the Nepalese Himalayas, where her father owned tea houses, and her mother still lives. Lhakpa tells me she isn’t sure of her exact age, as there were no birth certificates, and all of her mother’s 11 children were born at home. As a child, Lhakpa had no electricity, and young girls did not attend school.Lhapka Sherpa prepares tea at her home in West Hartford. Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The Guardian“You see my family on television,” she says. “Sherpas. Climbing Everest.” Her brother Mingma Gelu Sherpa directs an expedition outfitter in Kathmandu. Her oldest brother has summited “10 or 11 times,” she says. Another brother has summited eight times, her youngest brother five, and a sister has summited once.“If there weren’t any Sherpas,” she tells me, “nobody could climb Everest”.She worries when people say that anyone can climb Everest if they have the money – she’s heard people say that it’s just a matter of putting one foot in front of the other, and that Sherpas will do all the work. An average climb with a western outfitter costs upwards of $50,000, while a Nepalese outfitter costs upwards of $30,000.She has seen firsthand all the ways people can die on Everest: avalanches, falls, the thin air of the dead zone. Climbers must occasionally pass bodies, of which there are over a 100 on the mountain. (Bodies are dangerous to take down and doing so requires the effort of at least five sherpas.) Sherpas pass through the Khumbu icefall roughly 40 times just to make sure tourists have the supplies and ropes they need. If you spend enough time in the icefall, she says, you are guaranteed to die.“Why do we do this job?” she asks. “Because the alternative is to make money growing potatoes.”For Lhakpa, to say climbing Everest is easy is an insult. The fact that it is said at all reveals the problematic ways privilege has woven itself into adventure culture.Lhakpa Sherpa and her daughter Shiny, who says of her mother: ‘I’m proud of her, but I worry.’ Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The Guardian•••Serena Williams won the Australian Open while 23 weeks pregnant; Lhakpa Sherpa summited Everest eight months after the birth of her first child, and again while two months pregnant with Shiny.But unlike Williams, Lhakpa has no endorsement deals, no nutritionist, no trainer. She can’t afford to train full time, or much at all, because she works constantly in order to pay her rent.When she leaves her hourly jobs for climbing expeditions, she risks homelessness. When she returns, she picks up as much work as she can, working as a cashier at 7-Eleven and cleaning houses. “I never tell them about Everest,” she says, recounting a time when an employer realized that the woman mopping his floor was a world-renowned athlete.When I approached her for an interview, I asked her if we could hike together. As we prepare to leave for the walk, I notice that the grommet on Lhakpa’s hiking boots is broken, and she struggles to lace them. I’ve seen athletes with lesser accomplishments – but a higher number of Instagram followers – receive impressive amounts of free gear. Lhakpa mentions that her worn, orange Osprey backpack has summited Everest at least twice.Lhakpa Sherpa in 2006, when she broke her own record for the most Everest summits by a woman. Photograph: Prakash Mathema/AFP/GettyIn an era where many organizations profess a desire to diversify outdoors culture, it is difficult to process that such an accomplished athlete – with an authentic connection to the place she climbs - remains unsupported. I presume the root cause is that Lhakpa is not traditionally marketable, and brands want maximum visibility. She doesn’t have a curated Instagram presence. She’s a middle-aged woman of color, an immigrant single mother who speaks in broken English. She doesn’t exude “stoke”. She’s known to climb slowly on the lower slopes, at the advice of the Icefall Doctors, the Sherpas who manage the ropes and ladders over deep crevasses.In person, Lhakpa’s words are laced with intelligence and humor, and her passion for climbing is evident. “This is my gift,” she says of climbing. Though she would have liked to become a doctor or pilot in another life, she knows her talent is getting herself and others on top of some of the world’s largest peaks. Though Black Diamond sponsored an earlier climb, Lhakpa is currently without support.Her dream is to summit Everest in May 2020, followed by K2, a mountain whose summit once eluded her because of inclement weather. She knows this plan is ambitious, if not crazy. “All extreme athletes are crazy,” she says. “But I want to show the world I can do it. I want to show women who look like me that they can do it, too.”•••We take an easy hike on Talcott Mountain, a place she often goes with friends for a quick walk. She occasionally stops to place her hand on a rock face. We talk about the sounds of Everest, particularly the groaning ice. She shows me how she sleeps in a tent on the coldest nights, with her hands clasped underneath her body in the sleeping bag.Lhakpa began climbing in the same way many of her siblings and cousins did, helping an uncle move equipment for tourists on Makalu at 15, serving as a kitchen hand and porter. She says she was a tomboy, and that her mother worried she would never get married. She met her first husband on the mountain, and they moved to the United States in 2002. They often climbed together, until the relationship turned violent.> Climbing is my way out of washing dishes. It is the way to make a better life for the girlsIn 2004, her husband notoriously struck her on Everest, continuing a pattern of abuse that began upon the birth of their first child and continued on expeditions and at home. A difficult few years followed, with the family’s fortunes falling; by 2012 they were on food stamps. After further attacks, hospitalizations, and a stay at a shelter, the couple divorced, and Lhakpa was awarded full custody of the girls.I first learned about Lhakpa years ago, through the story of the 2004 climb, and have thought several times how damaging to her climbing career it must have been. She was forced to endure physical and emotional hardship in front of her professional community, and did not have the ability to control the public narrative. She left her marriage with no financial resources and two dependents. (Her oldest child, Nima, a son from another relationship, is now an adult.) She undoubtedly lost good climbing years to adversity, and yet her commitment to climbing persists.It has always seemed unfair to me to ask female athletes and artists about their marriage and children. Were the “great” male explorers of the past – or even the present – asked as often about how their children are cared for during an adventure, or if it’s OK to take certain risks – but to leave Lhakpa’s marriage and children out of the picture would perhaps be to hide one of her greatest challenges, and most profound motivations.“Climbing is my way out of washing dishes,” Lhakpa tells me. “It is the way to make a better life for the girls.”•••Lhakpa Sherpa: ‘If you don’t trust, you die.’ Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The GuardianAs we walk the well-worn paths of Talcott Mountain back to my car, Shiny becomes concerned about mosquitoes. “I don’t want you to get EEE when you’re out hiking,” she tells Lhakpa. I think about how difficult it must be to process the risks her mother takes, all while knowing her lifetime record of resilient comebacks. They look out for each other. Even when Lhakpa is posing for photographs at an outlook, she has one eye on her youngest daughter, and cautions her against stepping too close to the ridge line.Lhakpa and I talk about the difference between climbing Everest as a Sherpa, and as a climber. One you do for someone else, and the other you do for yourself. She expresses a moving amount of devotion to the clients Sherpas guide to the summit.“You make a promise,” she says, “and you keep it.” Lhakpa talks a lot about trust – trusting herself, trusting the climbing partner she’s tethered to, trusting the mountain. “If you don’t trust,” she says, “you die.”“I’m a small mouse climbing a big mountain,” Lhakpa tells me. Her relationship with the mountain is reverent, as if she’s in conversation with it. “Share with the mountain,” she says. “If you’re scared, your fear scares the mountain.” She even delayed 2019’s planned climb because of her beloved father’s death. “I didn’t want to carry the sadness,” she says. “It would not be safe.”When we get back to the apartment, Lhakpa shows me her boots and insulated Red Fox suit. “I look like a bear,” she says, slipping into the gear, which is reminiscent of a wearable sleeping bag. During climbing season, the temperatures on Everest’s summit range from -4F to -31F.Lhakpa displays the 50-year-old oxygen mask she wears because she says it’s more reliable than the new ones. Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The GuardianShe also wears a 50-year-old oxygen mask, because she believes it’s more reliable than the new ones. “I need smart students,” she says, asking me if I can find someone to design a better mask based on the old models. I picture a group of bright minds at MIT listening to this woman – this expert – who has grown up on the mountain and knows what climbers need as they step into the thin air of Everest.These are the other things Lhakpa wants: sponsorship for her historic 10th climb. Time to train and build her guiding business, Cloudscape Climbing. A life spent on the mountains and not cleaning dishes and taking out trash. A book and documentary about her life. Money to help send her bright daughters to college.“These are not quick dreams,” she adds. “They are long dreams.”Lhakpa has always worked hard to survive, and to subvert expectations. In the past, people have discounted the summits of Sherpas, saying that their familiarity with the altitude and location somehow diminishes the accomplishment. Lhakpa, who dared to step outside of a service culture and climb for herself, wants a 10th summit, and is serious about advancing her record.When I ask Shiny what she admires most about her mother, she pauses. “There is so much,” she says, her voice shaking. “But I would have to say her confidence.”Lhakpa is self-conscious of her hands, dried from washing dishes, and the jobs she must work in order to support her family. She is also driven to inspire others, particularly women and single parents. “I would like to hide in the mountain,” Lhakpa confesses on our descent, aware of her humble circumstances. “But I have to show my face here.”",http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aTsrZU.6T7nrIx0cghr9Rw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/924e3a16db3b93dd3a85bbed5207015e,She climbed Everest nine times and set a world record – so why doesn’t she have sponsors?
India Farmers Plan Nationwide Protest Against 16-Nation Trade Deal,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 08:50:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/india-farmers-plan-nationwide-protest-125007797.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. India’s farmers’ organizations have planned a nationwide protest on Nov. 4 to demand that the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi keep agriculture out of a 16-nation trade agreement currently being negotiated in Thailand.The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, an umbrella organization of about 250 farmers unions from across the country, said that they will burn effigies depicting the China-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership or RCEP, to mark their protest and warn the government.Indian farmers won’t be able to compete should the country agree to cut duties for agricultural and dairy products in the proposed trade pact, said V.M. Singh, a convener of the the farmers’ group. Imports of dairy and agricultural products including wheat, cotton and oil seeds would affect the livelihood of millions of Indian farmers, he said.The government should defer signing of the agreement and hold consultations with farmers, state governments and other stake holders before taking a final decision, said Singh. “We have to stop RCEP,” he said.It is not clear yet what terms India will agree to in order to join what could become the world’s largest trade deal. The final stage of negotiations have begun in Bangkok and Indian trade minister Piyush Goyal will travel for the ministerial meeting there on Nov. 1. The nations are seeking to conclude the negotiations by November end.To contact the reporter on this story: Bibhudatta Pradhan in New Delhi at bpradhan@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ruth Pollard at rpollard2@bloomberg.net, Muneeza Naqvi, Abhay SinghFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GF2o4tZmPCtqpE8IuBOemg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/38b9b9b23d04b76ac5ea78347d209b84,India Farmers Plan Nationwide Protest Against 16-Nation Trade Deal

Authorities Identify ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe’ Through DNA and Now the Real Questions Start,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:13:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/authorities-identify-fly-creek-jane-131307745.html,"On a chilly February Sunday in 1980, a father and son panning for gold along Fly Creek in Clark County, Washington, kicked up the remains of a human skeleton that appeared to have been buried in a shallow grave. They called the authorities who came to collect the skull and what bones hadn’t been dragged away by animals, and were able to use the remains to construct a facial reconstruction that produced a picture of a teenage girl. Detectives were able to deduce that she died from a cause that did not seem natural. Calls for information, searches through missing persons reports, and detective work turned up nothing. No one seemed to miss the teen, dubbed the ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe,’ and, for the last 40 years, that is as far as the case went–until now.This summer Clark County detectives decided to post a DNA sample from the old remains to the Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, a public genealogy database that has had recent success closing old cold cases. The lab found a tie to a distant cousin of a teen named Sandra “Sandy” Renee Morden who said she was last seen in 1977–three years before her skeletal remains were found. Courtesy of Clark County SheriffThe Oregonian then dug up an old birthday announcement that was tied to the case. On April 29, 1977, in the classified section of the paper, a tiny ad appeared that said: “Sandra Renee Morden, Happy 15th Birthday. Love Always—Mom.” Such published greetings were a common way to mark a birthday or anniversary in the era before Facebook and other social media. Morden’s parents were divorced, according to the DNA-linked cousin, who does not want to be named and who provided Clark County cold-case detective Lindsay Schultz with the only clues the teen’s life. Schultz told the Oregonian that Morden was a “latchkey kid” who was mostly “unsupervised.” There is no indication that the parents filed a missing persons report, and, as Schultz says, “We didn’t have [the National Crime Information Center] at that time.” The detective says Morden’s parents came from the San Francisco area and settled in Portland. They split up in the early 1970s, and did not communicate with each other. The girl’s mother, identified as Kathryn Irene Morden, apparently lost custody and the cousin said Sandy most often stayed with her father, identified as Andrew Bain Morden, a Marine Corps veteran who fought in the Korean War. Schultz says she likely fell through the cracks when one parent thought the other had her. She last attended Wilson High School in Portland. Schultz told the Oregonian that the father likely thought she was with her mother. He had left her alone for an extended period of time and when he came back, she was gone, so he assumed she had gone to her mother’s home. “We don’t know for certain,” Schultz says. “We know that’s what family members believe.”Both parents are dead, so there is no way to confirm what either of them knew. Schultz told the Oregonian that it is the birthday greeting that bothers him most. It was posted around the time the extended family says she disappeared. “Was it just a mom who loved her daughter–or did her mom know something and put it out there for that reason?” Schultz said. “It’s one of those two, right? You ponder it. You look at it and you think, ‘What does it mean?’”Now detectives are looking for the missing puzzle pieces. They are calling on anyone who might have any information about Morden, her parents, or how she might have died to contact the Clark County Medical Examiner's Office or Clark County Sheriff's Office Cold Case Tip Line.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

That’s the Talk in Moscow.,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 05:40:49 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/nobel-peace-prize-vladimir-putin-094049080.html,"Adam Berry/GettyMOSCOW—For those who live outside Russia and the enormous bubble of admiration inflated around President Vladimir Putin, this story may be a bit hard to believe. But there is a movement afoot here, apparently in all sincerity, to nominate Putin for the Nobel Peace Prize.From the outside, one must wonder how the dossier for the former KGB operative might be prepared. Would it include the peace of the grave imposed on civilians in the Second Chechen War early in Putin’s presidency? Or would it be for backing quasi states broken away from the Republic of Georgia? Or, more recently, for the forcible annexation of Crimea and the instigation of a separatist war in Ukraine that continues to this day? Alex Gibney: How Donald Trump Is Morphing Into Vladimir PutinOr perhaps he’d win for Syria, where Putin is a strong supporter of the Assad dictatorship that has killed hundreds of thousands of people while half of the nation’s population has been driven into internal or external exile. Would that be the venue for Putin the peacemaker to earn his Nobel laurels?In fact, through the looking glass of Moscow’s media and Putin’s supporters, Ukraine and Syria are held up as prime examples of his eligibility for The Prize.The general secretary of the Russian-Turkish Public Forum, Sergey Markov, who is close to the Kremlin, tells The Daily Beast that there is no better candidate for the prestigious award than Putin: “Most Russian state officials believe that President Putin deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for saving the world from a nuclear war during the crisis in Ukraine in 2014—for holding back and not bringing Russian forces to Kharkiv, Dnepropetrovsk, [Ukrainian] cities full of Russian people,” Markov said, adding, “Of course Putin should be given the prize for solving the Turkish-Kurdish conflict, which risked taking thousands of lives.” Forget U.S. President Donald Trump’s efforts to claim credit for a ceasefire deal with Ankara, Putin’s supporters in Moscow believe that it was Putin alone who managed to find the solution and negotiate a deal with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that prevented a Turkish-Kurdish bloodbath. Whoever is responsible, the arrangement is essentially on Erdogan’s terms, opening the way for ethnic cleansing as Kurdish troops withdraw, Kurdish civilians flee, and Erdogan plans to move millions of Syrian Arabs, most of them from other parts of the country, into what Erdogan calls a “safe zone.”Yet Aleksey Venediktov, editor-in-chief of the influential independent radio station Echo of Moscow, tweeted last week as that deal came down: “They tell me at the top: ‘Now you understand, Putin deserves a Nobel Peace Prize.’” He said his high-level sources were telling him Putin’s Syria deal was like “the new Camp David Accord,” putting it on a par with the 1978 agreement brokered by President Jimmy Carter that ended generations of war between Israel and Egypt. In truth, the Russian leader has been looking to win The Prize for years. Ever since Time magazine put Putin on the cover as Person of the Year in 2007, the Kremlin’s ideologues have believed that the West recognizes Putin as the world’s preeminent politician—and peacemaker—and no wars in Georgia, Ukraine or Syria could dissuade them.Putin’s greatest accomplishment on that score probably came in 2013 when President Barack Obama was weighing the possibility of major military strikes on the Bashar al-Assad regime to retaliate for its use of chemical weapons, and Putin stepped in with a better—or at least more peaceful—plan. He persuaded Assad, first, to admit he had a chemical arsenal, which he had never done before. Then Assad agreed to U.N. inspections as he eliminated everything he admitted to having, and by all accounts the vast majority of those gruesome weapons were destroyed. At the time, that seemed like a major war averted, and therefore a pathway to peace.So at the beginning of 2014 a Russian advocacy group called the International Academy of Spiritual Unity and Cooperation of People put Putin up for the prize.Unfortunately for Putin’s aspirations, there’s quite a long delay between the nominations at the beginning of the year, and the awards at the end, and Putin was not exactly making peace in 2014. Reacting to a popular pro-European, largely anti-Russian uprising in Ukraine, he seized the Crimean Peninsula, annexed it to Russia, and poured support into separatist rebels in Eastern Ukraine. The death toll soon climbed into the thousands, with hundreds of thousands of people displaced. In July 2014 a Russian-supplied missile shot down a Malaysian Airliner en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur with 298 people on board, all of whom died.If anyone argued in 2014, as Markov suggests, that Putin should have gotten a peace prize for not staging a massive, direct invasion of Ukraine to take the large cities of Kharkiv and Dnepropetrovsk, the Nobel Committee in Norway clearly was not persuaded. It gave the 2014 prize to Kailash Satyarthi and Malala Yousafzai ""for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education.""Russia’s record in Syria has been equally bloody since it entered the fight directly to support Assad in 2015.  One recent example was a Russian-Syrian military strike on a center for hundreds of displaced people in the town of Haas in Idlib that killed 20 civilians in August. A Human Rights Watch investigation published in October qualified the attack as “an apparent war crime.” Sara Kayyali who monitors the violations on the ground for HRW, tells The Daily Beast that “Russian strikes on protected humanitarian infrastructure” have been common in the areas where they operate, with “severely negative consequences.”Now, says Kayyali, “Russia has brokered an agreement with Turkey around a so-called ‘safe zone,’ but as history has proved again and again, safe zones are rarely safe.” President Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov gloated last week, saying, ""The United States was the closest ally of the Kurds during the last few years, and in the end the U.S. ditched the Kurds and effectively betrayed them."" By arranging for the withdrawal of the fighters, Peskov suggested, Russia is at least saving their lives. The United States looks foolish and treacherous, to be sure. But some analysts suggest Russia’s schadenfreude is premature. David Aaron Miller at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace notes that among some in Washington, “Animosity toward Trump and Putin—richly deserved—is clouding the analysis on Syria  and triggering overreaction about Russia’s gains.”As Miller points out, “Russia has been the dominant external power in Syria since at least the 1970s. And the U.S. withdrawal has no doubt consolidated that and elevated Russia’s role in the region. But we shouldn’t overestimate Moscow’s gains.  They now preside over a broken country that will take years and billions to heal. They are shackled with a pariah regime—both entitled and dependent—that will continue to alienate the majority of the Sunni population; they face a resurgent ISIS and are now shackled with responsibility for managing both the Turkish-Syrian-Kurdish triangle and a potential Israeli-Iranian conflict.”“The idea of giving Putin a Nobel Peace Prize sounds ridiculous after years of this dirty war in Syria, the Russian military violating international law, using banned weapons, bombing hospitals and clinics,” Tania Lokshina, Europe and Central Asia associate director at Human Rights Watch Moscow, told The Daily Beast. But still the dream lives on, revived by the agreement moving the Kurds out of the region near the Turkish border. Last week the Russian news agency riafan.ru headlined: “Foreigners propose to award Putin with a Nobel Prize for peace in Syria.” The deadline for Nobel nominations is January 31. One can only guess at the peace initiatives Putin will carry out between now and then.Is Trump Saving Those Syrian Oil Fields for the Russians?Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Chris Christie Is Among Lawyers Reaping $15 Million in 1MDB Deal,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:33:49 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/chris-christie-among-lawyers-reaping-133349408.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest recovery ever from an American anti-corruption crackdown is proving lucrative for former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.A major deal struck by the U.S. for fugitive financier Jho Low to give up almost $1 billion in assets allegedly stolen from a Malaysian investment fund comes with a provision to pay his lawyers. As part of the 1MDB settlement, the Justice Department allowed for $15 million to be paid to a group advising Jho Low, including the law firm Christie set up after two terms as New Jersey’s governor.Those proceeds will come from Jho Low’s stake in EMI Music Publishing, which has grown to about $415 million. That investment ballooned after he initially put in a little more than $100 million stolen from 1MDB, according to prosecutors. The two sides agreed to the provision to allow the lawyers to extract fees from Low, whose assets and accounts have been seized or monitored by authorities across the world.“We were pleased to help negotiate this historic resolution in order to preserve the tremendous value of assets involved,” Christie said in a statement after the Justice Department announced the settlement agreement on Wednesday. It still needs approval from a federal judge.Christie, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 before dropping out and endorsing Donald Trump, set up his own law firm last year, the Christie Law Firm LLC. The other firms that will receive proceeds of the 1MDB deal for legal expenses are Kobre & Kim LLP and Lowenstein Sandler LLP.The agreement comes even before the criminal charges against Low have been resolved. In the settlement, the Justice Department cautioned that the released funds should be used only for the Low family’s legal fees and costs related to the lawsuits, and can’t be routed back to Low or his family.To contact the reporter on this story: Sridhar Natarajan in New York at snatarajan15@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

She climbed Everest nine times and set a world record – so why doesn’t she have sponsors?,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 02:00:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/she-climbed-everest-nine-times-060021913.html,"Lhakpa Sherpa works for minimum wages and currently washes dishes, as she trains for her 10th Everest summit with no endorsement deals, no nutritionist and no trainerLhakpa Sherpa in Talcott Mountain state park in Simsbury, Connecticut, where she hikes to prepare for her 10th summit of Everest in the spring of 2020. Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The GuardianI reach Lhakpa Sherpa’s West Hartford apartment at noon on an overcast Sunday in Connecticut. She bounds out of the front door, embraces me, and welcomes me inside. The small apartment is dimly lit. The living room has a few chairs, and a wall of sports medals from her two daughters’ 5Ks and gymnastic meets.Lhakpa was the first Nepalese woman to summit Everest and descend alive, which she accomplished in the spring of 2000. With nine summits, she holds the world record for women. She plans to summit the world’s highest mountain again in the spring of 2020, but as an unsponsored athlete and single mother of three, it’s difficult to afford training and travel. She currently works at Whole Foods washing dishes, making minimum wage. Unable to afford or drive a car, she walks to work and occasionally takes an Uber to training destinations.Sitting in her living room, I’m struck by her achievements – but also her lack of resources. How is it that a woman with such demonstrated accomplishment and skill is without sponsorship, and must risk nearly everything to continue to climb the Himalayan mountains she loves?Lhakpa makes tea while I chat with her 13-year-old daughter, Shiny, who – more fluent in technology and the English language – acts as her mother’s manager and occasional translator.“What’s it like for you,” I ask, “when your mother is away on an expedition?”> I want to show the world I can do it. I want to show women who look like me that they can do it, too.She turns her phone over in her hands. “It’s hard,” she says. “I’m proud of her, but I worry.” Each climbing season, six to 10 climbers die on the mountain.Everest expeditions last upwards of two months, usually in May, and there are only occasional opportunities to communicate via satellite phone and Skype. Avalanches, like the one that hit base camp in 2015, have kept them out of contact for weeks at a time.“I’m very good with the mountain,” Lhakpa says, bringing me a hot cup of tea, offering her warm smile. She has a long, lush ponytail and bright eyes. “I go, but I know I will come home. I have to come home.” She looks reassuringly at Shiny.Lhakpa, 45, grew up in Balakharka, a village in the Makalu region of the Nepalese Himalayas, where her father owned tea houses, and her mother still lives. Lhakpa tells me she isn’t sure of her exact age, as there were no birth certificates, and all of her mother’s 11 children were born at home. As a child, Lhakpa had no electricity, and young girls did not attend school.Lhapka Sherpa prepares tea at her home in West Hartford. Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The Guardian“You see my family on television,” she says. “Sherpas. Climbing Everest.” Her brother Mingma Gelu Sherpa directs an expedition outfitter in Kathmandu. Her oldest brother has summited “10 or 11 times,” she says. Another brother has summited eight times, her youngest brother five, and a sister has summited once.“If there weren’t any Sherpas,” she tells me, “nobody could climb Everest”.She worries when people say that anyone can climb Everest if they have the money – she’s heard people say that it’s just a matter of putting one foot in front of the other, and that Sherpas will do all the work. An average climb with a western outfitter costs upwards of $50,000, while a Nepalese outfitter costs upwards of $30,000.She has seen firsthand all the ways people can die on Everest: avalanches, falls, the thin air of the dead zone. Climbers must occasionally pass bodies, of which there are over a 100 on the mountain. (Bodies are dangerous to take down and doing so requires the effort of at least five sherpas.) Sherpas pass through the Khumbu icefall roughly 40 times just to make sure tourists have the supplies and ropes they need. If you spend enough time in the icefall, she says, you are guaranteed to die.“Why do we do this job?” she asks. “Because the alternative is to make money growing potatoes.”For Lhakpa, to say climbing Everest is easy is an insult. The fact that it is said at all reveals the problematic ways privilege has woven itself into adventure culture.Lhakpa Sherpa and her daughter Shiny, who says of her mother: ‘I’m proud of her, but I worry.’ Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The Guardian•••Serena Williams won the Australian Open while 23 weeks pregnant; Lhakpa Sherpa summited Everest eight months after the birth of her first child, and again while two months pregnant with Shiny.But unlike Williams, Lhakpa has no endorsement deals, no nutritionist, no trainer. She can’t afford to train full time, or much at all, because she works constantly in order to pay her rent.When she leaves her hourly jobs for climbing expeditions, she risks homelessness. When she returns, she picks up as much work as she can, working as a cashier at 7-Eleven and cleaning houses. “I never tell them about Everest,” she says, recounting a time when an employer realized that the woman mopping his floor was a world-renowned athlete.When I approached her for an interview, I asked her if we could hike together. As we prepare to leave for the walk, I notice that the grommet on Lhakpa’s hiking boots is broken, and she struggles to lace them. I’ve seen athletes with lesser accomplishments – but a higher number of Instagram followers – receive impressive amounts of free gear. Lhakpa mentions that her worn, orange Osprey backpack has summited Everest at least twice.Lhakpa Sherpa in 2006, when she broke her own record for the most Everest summits by a woman. Photograph: Prakash Mathema/AFP/GettyIn an era where many organizations profess a desire to diversify outdoors culture, it is difficult to process that such an accomplished athlete – with an authentic connection to the place she climbs - remains unsupported. I presume the root cause is that Lhakpa is not traditionally marketable, and brands want maximum visibility. She doesn’t have a curated Instagram presence. She’s a middle-aged woman of color, an immigrant single mother who speaks in broken English. She doesn’t exude “stoke”. She’s known to climb slowly on the lower slopes, at the advice of the Icefall Doctors, the Sherpas who manage the ropes and ladders over deep crevasses.In person, Lhakpa’s words are laced with intelligence and humor, and her passion for climbing is evident. “This is my gift,” she says of climbing. Though she would have liked to become a doctor or pilot in another life, she knows her talent is getting herself and others on top of some of the world’s largest peaks. Though Black Diamond sponsored an earlier climb, Lhakpa is currently without support.Her dream is to summit Everest in May 2020, followed by K2, a mountain whose summit once eluded her because of inclement weather. She knows this plan is ambitious, if not crazy. “All extreme athletes are crazy,” she says. “But I want to show the world I can do it. I want to show women who look like me that they can do it, too.”•••We take an easy hike on Talcott Mountain, a place she often goes with friends for a quick walk. She occasionally stops to place her hand on a rock face. We talk about the sounds of Everest, particularly the groaning ice. She shows me how she sleeps in a tent on the coldest nights, with her hands clasped underneath her body in the sleeping bag.Lhakpa began climbing in the same way many of her siblings and cousins did, helping an uncle move equipment for tourists on Makalu at 15, serving as a kitchen hand and porter. She says she was a tomboy, and that her mother worried she would never get married. She met her first husband on the mountain, and they moved to the United States in 2002. They often climbed together, until the relationship turned violent.> Climbing is my way out of washing dishes. It is the way to make a better life for the girlsIn 2004, her husband notoriously struck her on Everest, continuing a pattern of abuse that began upon the birth of their first child and continued on expeditions and at home. A difficult few years followed, with the family’s fortunes falling; by 2012 they were on food stamps. After further attacks, hospitalizations, and a stay at a shelter, the couple divorced, and Lhakpa was awarded full custody of the girls.I first learned about Lhakpa years ago, through the story of the 2004 climb, and have thought several times how damaging to her climbing career it must have been. She was forced to endure physical and emotional hardship in front of her professional community, and did not have the ability to control the public narrative. She left her marriage with no financial resources and two dependents. (Her oldest child, Nima, a son from another relationship, is now an adult.) She undoubtedly lost good climbing years to adversity, and yet her commitment to climbing persists.It has always seemed unfair to me to ask female athletes and artists about their marriage and children. Were the “great” male explorers of the past – or even the present – asked as often about how their children are cared for during an adventure, or if it’s OK to take certain risks – but to leave Lhakpa’s marriage and children out of the picture would perhaps be to hide one of her greatest challenges, and most profound motivations.“Climbing is my way out of washing dishes,” Lhakpa tells me. “It is the way to make a better life for the girls.”•••Lhakpa Sherpa: ‘If you don’t trust, you die.’ Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The GuardianAs we walk the well-worn paths of Talcott Mountain back to my car, Shiny becomes concerned about mosquitoes. “I don’t want you to get EEE when you’re out hiking,” she tells Lhakpa. I think about how difficult it must be to process the risks her mother takes, all while knowing her lifetime record of resilient comebacks. They look out for each other. Even when Lhakpa is posing for photographs at an outlook, she has one eye on her youngest daughter, and cautions her against stepping too close to the ridge line.Lhakpa and I talk about the difference between climbing Everest as a Sherpa, and as a climber. One you do for someone else, and the other you do for yourself. She expresses a moving amount of devotion to the clients Sherpas guide to the summit.“You make a promise,” she says, “and you keep it.” Lhakpa talks a lot about trust – trusting herself, trusting the climbing partner she’s tethered to, trusting the mountain. “If you don’t trust,” she says, “you die.”“I’m a small mouse climbing a big mountain,” Lhakpa tells me. Her relationship with the mountain is reverent, as if she’s in conversation with it. “Share with the mountain,” she says. “If you’re scared, your fear scares the mountain.” She even delayed 2019’s planned climb because of her beloved father’s death. “I didn’t want to carry the sadness,” she says. “It would not be safe.”When we get back to the apartment, Lhakpa shows me her boots and insulated Red Fox suit. “I look like a bear,” she says, slipping into the gear, which is reminiscent of a wearable sleeping bag. During climbing season, the temperatures on Everest’s summit range from -4F to -31F.Lhakpa displays the 50-year-old oxygen mask she wears because she says it’s more reliable than the new ones. Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The GuardianShe also wears a 50-year-old oxygen mask, because she believes it’s more reliable than the new ones. “I need smart students,” she says, asking me if I can find someone to design a better mask based on the old models. I picture a group of bright minds at MIT listening to this woman – this expert – who has grown up on the mountain and knows what climbers need as they step into the thin air of Everest.These are the other things Lhakpa wants: sponsorship for her historic 10th climb. Time to train and build her guiding business, Cloudscape Climbing. A life spent on the mountains and not cleaning dishes and taking out trash. A book and documentary about her life. Money to help send her bright daughters to college.“These are not quick dreams,” she adds. “They are long dreams.”Lhakpa has always worked hard to survive, and to subvert expectations. In the past, people have discounted the summits of Sherpas, saying that their familiarity with the altitude and location somehow diminishes the accomplishment. Lhakpa, who dared to step outside of a service culture and climb for herself, wants a 10th summit, and is serious about advancing her record.When I ask Shiny what she admires most about her mother, she pauses. “There is so much,” she says, her voice shaking. “But I would have to say her confidence.”Lhakpa is self-conscious of her hands, dried from washing dishes, and the jobs she must work in order to support her family. She is also driven to inspire others, particularly women and single parents. “I would like to hide in the mountain,” Lhakpa confesses on our descent, aware of her humble circumstances. “But I have to show my face here.”",http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aTsrZU.6T7nrIx0cghr9Rw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/924e3a16db3b93dd3a85bbed5207015e,She climbed Everest nine times and set a world record – so why doesn’t she have sponsors?
India Farmers Plan Nationwide Protest Against 16-Nation Trade Deal,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 08:50:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/india-farmers-plan-nationwide-protest-125007797.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. India’s farmers’ organizations have planned a nationwide protest on Nov. 4 to demand that the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi keep agriculture out of a 16-nation trade agreement currently being negotiated in Thailand.The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, an umbrella organization of about 250 farmers unions from across the country, said that they will burn effigies depicting the China-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership or RCEP, to mark their protest and warn the government.Indian farmers won’t be able to compete should the country agree to cut duties for agricultural and dairy products in the proposed trade pact, said V.M. Singh, a convener of the the farmers’ group. Imports of dairy and agricultural products including wheat, cotton and oil seeds would affect the livelihood of millions of Indian farmers, he said.The government should defer signing of the agreement and hold consultations with farmers, state governments and other stake holders before taking a final decision, said Singh. “We have to stop RCEP,” he said.It is not clear yet what terms India will agree to in order to join what could become the world’s largest trade deal. The final stage of negotiations have begun in Bangkok and Indian trade minister Piyush Goyal will travel for the ministerial meeting there on Nov. 1. The nations are seeking to conclude the negotiations by November end.To contact the reporter on this story: Bibhudatta Pradhan in New Delhi at bpradhan@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ruth Pollard at rpollard2@bloomberg.net, Muneeza Naqvi, Abhay SinghFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GF2o4tZmPCtqpE8IuBOemg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/38b9b9b23d04b76ac5ea78347d209b84,India Farmers Plan Nationwide Protest Against 16-Nation Trade Deal

Authorities Identify ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe’ Through DNA and Now the Real Questions Start,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:13:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/authorities-identify-fly-creek-jane-131307745.html,"On a chilly February Sunday in 1980, a father and son panning for gold along Fly Creek in Clark County, Washington, kicked up the remains of a human skeleton that appeared to have been buried in a shallow grave. They called the authorities who came to collect the skull and what bones hadn’t been dragged away by animals, and were able to use the remains to construct a facial reconstruction that produced a picture of a teenage girl. Detectives were able to deduce that she died from a cause that did not seem natural. Calls for information, searches through missing persons reports, and detective work turned up nothing. No one seemed to miss the teen, dubbed the ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe,’ and, for the last 40 years, that is as far as the case went–until now.This summer Clark County detectives decided to post a DNA sample from the old remains to the Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, a public genealogy database that has had recent success closing old cold cases. The lab found a tie to a distant cousin of a teen named Sandra “Sandy” Renee Morden who said she was last seen in 1977–three years before her skeletal remains were found. Courtesy of Clark County SheriffThe Oregonian then dug up an old birthday announcement that was tied to the case. On April 29, 1977, in the classified section of the paper, a tiny ad appeared that said: “Sandra Renee Morden, Happy 15th Birthday. Love Always—Mom.” Such published greetings were a common way to mark a birthday or anniversary in the era before Facebook and other social media. Morden’s parents were divorced, according to the DNA-linked cousin, who does not want to be named and who provided Clark County cold-case detective Lindsay Schultz with the only clues the teen’s life. Schultz told the Oregonian that Morden was a “latchkey kid” who was mostly “unsupervised.” There is no indication that the parents filed a missing persons report, and, as Schultz says, “We didn’t have [the National Crime Information Center] at that time.” The detective says Morden’s parents came from the San Francisco area and settled in Portland. They split up in the early 1970s, and did not communicate with each other. The girl’s mother, identified as Kathryn Irene Morden, apparently lost custody and the cousin said Sandy most often stayed with her father, identified as Andrew Bain Morden, a Marine Corps veteran who fought in the Korean War. Schultz says she likely fell through the cracks when one parent thought the other had her. She last attended Wilson High School in Portland. Schultz told the Oregonian that the father likely thought she was with her mother. He had left her alone for an extended period of time and when he came back, she was gone, so he assumed she had gone to her mother’s home. “We don’t know for certain,” Schultz says. “We know that’s what family members believe.”Both parents are dead, so there is no way to confirm what either of them knew. Schultz told the Oregonian that it is the birthday greeting that bothers him most. It was posted around the time the extended family says she disappeared. “Was it just a mom who loved her daughter–or did her mom know something and put it out there for that reason?” Schultz said. “It’s one of those two, right? You ponder it. You look at it and you think, ‘What does it mean?’”Now detectives are looking for the missing puzzle pieces. They are calling on anyone who might have any information about Morden, her parents, or how she might have died to contact the Clark County Medical Examiner's Office or Clark County Sheriff's Office Cold Case Tip Line.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

A Nobel Peace Prize for Vladimir Putin? That’s the Talk in Moscow.,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 05:40:49 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/nobel-peace-prize-vladimir-putin-094049080.html,"Adam Berry/GettyMOSCOW—For those who live outside Russia and the enormous bubble of admiration inflated around President Vladimir Putin, this story may be a bit hard to believe. But there is a movement afoot here, apparently in all sincerity, to nominate Putin for the Nobel Peace Prize.From the outside, one must wonder how the dossier for the former KGB operative might be prepared. Would it include the peace of the grave imposed on civilians in the Second Chechen War early in Putin’s presidency? Or would it be for backing quasi states broken away from the Republic of Georgia? Or, more recently, for the forcible annexation of Crimea and the instigation of a separatist war in Ukraine that continues to this day? Alex Gibney: How Donald Trump Is Morphing Into Vladimir PutinOr perhaps he’d win for Syria, where Putin is a strong supporter of the Assad dictatorship that has killed hundreds of thousands of people while half of the nation’s population has been driven into internal or external exile. Would that be the venue for Putin the peacemaker to earn his Nobel laurels?In fact, through the looking glass of Moscow’s media and Putin’s supporters, Ukraine and Syria are held up as prime examples of his eligibility for The Prize.The general secretary of the Russian-Turkish Public Forum, Sergey Markov, who is close to the Kremlin, tells The Daily Beast that there is no better candidate for the prestigious award than Putin: “Most Russian state officials believe that President Putin deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for saving the world from a nuclear war during the crisis in Ukraine in 2014—for holding back and not bringing Russian forces to Kharkiv, Dnepropetrovsk, [Ukrainian] cities full of Russian people,” Markov said, adding, “Of course Putin should be given the prize for solving the Turkish-Kurdish conflict, which risked taking thousands of lives.” Forget U.S. President Donald Trump’s efforts to claim credit for a ceasefire deal with Ankara, Putin’s supporters in Moscow believe that it was Putin alone who managed to find the solution and negotiate a deal with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that prevented a Turkish-Kurdish bloodbath. Whoever is responsible, the arrangement is essentially on Erdogan’s terms, opening the way for ethnic cleansing as Kurdish troops withdraw, Kurdish civilians flee, and Erdogan plans to move millions of Syrian Arabs, most of them from other parts of the country, into what Erdogan calls a “safe zone.”Yet Aleksey Venediktov, editor-in-chief of the influential independent radio station Echo of Moscow, tweeted last week as that deal came down: “They tell me at the top: ‘Now you understand, Putin deserves a Nobel Peace Prize.’” He said his high-level sources were telling him Putin’s Syria deal was like “the new Camp David Accord,” putting it on a par with the 1978 agreement brokered by President Jimmy Carter that ended generations of war between Israel and Egypt. In truth, the Russian leader has been looking to win The Prize for years. Ever since Time magazine put Putin on the cover as Person of the Year in 2007, the Kremlin’s ideologues have believed that the West recognizes Putin as the world’s preeminent politician—and peacemaker—and no wars in Georgia, Ukraine or Syria could dissuade them.Putin’s greatest accomplishment on that score probably came in 2013 when President Barack Obama was weighing the possibility of major military strikes on the Bashar al-Assad regime to retaliate for its use of chemical weapons, and Putin stepped in with a better—or at least more peaceful—plan. He persuaded Assad, first, to admit he had a chemical arsenal, which he had never done before. Then Assad agreed to U.N. inspections as he eliminated everything he admitted to having, and by all accounts the vast majority of those gruesome weapons were destroyed. At the time, that seemed like a major war averted, and therefore a pathway to peace.So at the beginning of 2014 a Russian advocacy group called the International Academy of Spiritual Unity and Cooperation of People put Putin up for the prize.Unfortunately for Putin’s aspirations, there’s quite a long delay between the nominations at the beginning of the year, and the awards at the end, and Putin was not exactly making peace in 2014. Reacting to a popular pro-European, largely anti-Russian uprising in Ukraine, he seized the Crimean Peninsula, annexed it to Russia, and poured support into separatist rebels in Eastern Ukraine. The death toll soon climbed into the thousands, with hundreds of thousands of people displaced. In July 2014 a Russian-supplied missile shot down a Malaysian Airliner en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur with 298 people on board, all of whom died.If anyone argued in 2014, as Markov suggests, that Putin should have gotten a peace prize for not staging a massive, direct invasion of Ukraine to take the large cities of Kharkiv and Dnepropetrovsk, the Nobel Committee in Norway clearly was not persuaded. It gave the 2014 prize to Kailash Satyarthi and Malala Yousafzai ""for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education.""Russia’s record in Syria has been equally bloody since it entered the fight directly to support Assad in 2015.  One recent example was a Russian-Syrian military strike on a center for hundreds of displaced people in the town of Haas in Idlib that killed 20 civilians in August. A Human Rights Watch investigation published in October qualified the attack as “an apparent war crime.” Sara Kayyali who monitors the violations on the ground for HRW, tells The Daily Beast that “Russian strikes on protected humanitarian infrastructure” have been common in the areas where they operate, with “severely negative consequences.”Now, says Kayyali, “Russia has brokered an agreement with Turkey around a so-called ‘safe zone,’ but as history has proved again and again, safe zones are rarely safe.” President Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov gloated last week, saying, ""The United States was the closest ally of the Kurds during the last few years, and in the end the U.S. ditched the Kurds and effectively betrayed them."" By arranging for the withdrawal of the fighters, Peskov suggested, Russia is at least saving their lives. The United States looks foolish and treacherous, to be sure. But some analysts suggest Russia’s schadenfreude is premature. David Aaron Miller at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace notes that among some in Washington, “Animosity toward Trump and Putin—richly deserved—is clouding the analysis on Syria  and triggering overreaction about Russia’s gains.”As Miller points out, “Russia has been the dominant external power in Syria since at least the 1970s. And the U.S. withdrawal has no doubt consolidated that and elevated Russia’s role in the region. But we shouldn’t overestimate Moscow’s gains.  They now preside over a broken country that will take years and billions to heal. They are shackled with a pariah regime—both entitled and dependent—that will continue to alienate the majority of the Sunni population; they face a resurgent ISIS and are now shackled with responsibility for managing both the Turkish-Syrian-Kurdish triangle and a potential Israeli-Iranian conflict.”“The idea of giving Putin a Nobel Peace Prize sounds ridiculous after years of this dirty war in Syria, the Russian military violating international law, using banned weapons, bombing hospitals and clinics,” Tania Lokshina, Europe and Central Asia associate director at Human Rights Watch Moscow, told The Daily Beast. But still the dream lives on, revived by the agreement moving the Kurds out of the region near the Turkish border. Last week the Russian news agency riafan.ru headlined: “Foreigners propose to award Putin with a Nobel Prize for peace in Syria.” The deadline for Nobel nominations is January 31. One can only guess at the peace initiatives Putin will carry out between now and then.Is Trump Saving Those Syrian Oil Fields for the Russians?Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Chris Christie Is Among Lawyers Reaping $15 Million in 1MDB Deal,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:33:49 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/chris-christie-among-lawyers-reaping-133349408.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest recovery ever from an American anti-corruption crackdown is proving lucrative for former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.A major deal struck by the U.S. for fugitive financier Jho Low to give up almost $1 billion in assets allegedly stolen from a Malaysian investment fund comes with a provision to pay his lawyers. As part of the 1MDB settlement, the Justice Department allowed for $15 million to be paid to a group advising Jho Low, including the law firm Christie set up after two terms as New Jersey’s governor.Those proceeds will come from Jho Low’s stake in EMI Music Publishing, which has grown to about $415 million. That investment ballooned after he initially put in a little more than $100 million stolen from 1MDB, according to prosecutors. The two sides agreed to the provision to allow the lawyers to extract fees from Low, whose assets and accounts have been seized or monitored by authorities across the world.“We were pleased to help negotiate this historic resolution in order to preserve the tremendous value of assets involved,” Christie said in a statement after the Justice Department announced the settlement agreement on Wednesday. It still needs approval from a federal judge.Christie, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 before dropping out and endorsing Donald Trump, set up his own law firm last year, the Christie Law Firm LLC. The other firms that will receive proceeds of the 1MDB deal for legal expenses are Kobre & Kim LLP and Lowenstein Sandler LLP.The agreement comes even before the criminal charges against Low have been resolved. In the settlement, the Justice Department cautioned that the released funds should be used only for the Low family’s legal fees and costs related to the lawsuits, and can’t be routed back to Low or his family.To contact the reporter on this story: Sridhar Natarajan in New York at snatarajan15@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

She climbed Everest nine times and set a world record – so why doesn’t she have sponsors?,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 02:00:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/she-climbed-everest-nine-times-060021913.html,"Lhakpa Sherpa works for minimum wages and currently washes dishes, as she trains for her 10th Everest summit with no endorsement deals, no nutritionist and no trainerLhakpa Sherpa in Talcott Mountain state park in Simsbury, Connecticut, where she hikes to prepare for her 10th summit of Everest in the spring of 2020. Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The GuardianI reach Lhakpa Sherpa’s West Hartford apartment at noon on an overcast Sunday in Connecticut. She bounds out of the front door, embraces me, and welcomes me inside. The small apartment is dimly lit. The living room has a few chairs, and a wall of sports medals from her two daughters’ 5Ks and gymnastic meets.Lhakpa was the first Nepalese woman to summit Everest and descend alive, which she accomplished in the spring of 2000. With nine summits, she holds the world record for women. She plans to summit the world’s highest mountain again in the spring of 2020, but as an unsponsored athlete and single mother of three, it’s difficult to afford training and travel. She currently works at Whole Foods washing dishes, making minimum wage. Unable to afford or drive a car, she walks to work and occasionally takes an Uber to training destinations.Sitting in her living room, I’m struck by her achievements – but also her lack of resources. How is it that a woman with such demonstrated accomplishment and skill is without sponsorship, and must risk nearly everything to continue to climb the Himalayan mountains she loves?Lhakpa makes tea while I chat with her 13-year-old daughter, Shiny, who – more fluent in technology and the English language – acts as her mother’s manager and occasional translator.“What’s it like for you,” I ask, “when your mother is away on an expedition?”> I want to show the world I can do it. I want to show women who look like me that they can do it, too.She turns her phone over in her hands. “It’s hard,” she says. “I’m proud of her, but I worry.” Each climbing season, six to 10 climbers die on the mountain.Everest expeditions last upwards of two months, usually in May, and there are only occasional opportunities to communicate via satellite phone and Skype. Avalanches, like the one that hit base camp in 2015, have kept them out of contact for weeks at a time.“I’m very good with the mountain,” Lhakpa says, bringing me a hot cup of tea, offering her warm smile. She has a long, lush ponytail and bright eyes. “I go, but I know I will come home. I have to come home.” She looks reassuringly at Shiny.Lhakpa, 45, grew up in Balakharka, a village in the Makalu region of the Nepalese Himalayas, where her father owned tea houses, and her mother still lives. Lhakpa tells me she isn’t sure of her exact age, as there were no birth certificates, and all of her mother’s 11 children were born at home. As a child, Lhakpa had no electricity, and young girls did not attend school.Lhapka Sherpa prepares tea at her home in West Hartford. Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The Guardian“You see my family on television,” she says. “Sherpas. Climbing Everest.” Her brother Mingma Gelu Sherpa directs an expedition outfitter in Kathmandu. Her oldest brother has summited “10 or 11 times,” she says. Another brother has summited eight times, her youngest brother five, and a sister has summited once.“If there weren’t any Sherpas,” she tells me, “nobody could climb Everest”.She worries when people say that anyone can climb Everest if they have the money – she’s heard people say that it’s just a matter of putting one foot in front of the other, and that Sherpas will do all the work. An average climb with a western outfitter costs upwards of $50,000, while a Nepalese outfitter costs upwards of $30,000.She has seen firsthand all the ways people can die on Everest: avalanches, falls, the thin air of the dead zone. Climbers must occasionally pass bodies, of which there are over a 100 on the mountain. (Bodies are dangerous to take down and doing so requires the effort of at least five sherpas.) Sherpas pass through the Khumbu icefall roughly 40 times just to make sure tourists have the supplies and ropes they need. If you spend enough time in the icefall, she says, you are guaranteed to die.“Why do we do this job?” she asks. “Because the alternative is to make money growing potatoes.”For Lhakpa, to say climbing Everest is easy is an insult. The fact that it is said at all reveals the problematic ways privilege has woven itself into adventure culture.Lhakpa Sherpa and her daughter Shiny, who says of her mother: ‘I’m proud of her, but I worry.’ Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The Guardian•••Serena Williams won the Australian Open while 23 weeks pregnant; Lhakpa Sherpa summited Everest eight months after the birth of her first child, and again while two months pregnant with Shiny.But unlike Williams, Lhakpa has no endorsement deals, no nutritionist, no trainer. She can’t afford to train full time, or much at all, because she works constantly in order to pay her rent.When she leaves her hourly jobs for climbing expeditions, she risks homelessness. When she returns, she picks up as much work as she can, working as a cashier at 7-Eleven and cleaning houses. “I never tell them about Everest,” she says, recounting a time when an employer realized that the woman mopping his floor was a world-renowned athlete.When I approached her for an interview, I asked her if we could hike together. As we prepare to leave for the walk, I notice that the grommet on Lhakpa’s hiking boots is broken, and she struggles to lace them. I’ve seen athletes with lesser accomplishments – but a higher number of Instagram followers – receive impressive amounts of free gear. Lhakpa mentions that her worn, orange Osprey backpack has summited Everest at least twice.Lhakpa Sherpa in 2006, when she broke her own record for the most Everest summits by a woman. Photograph: Prakash Mathema/AFP/GettyIn an era where many organizations profess a desire to diversify outdoors culture, it is difficult to process that such an accomplished athlete – with an authentic connection to the place she climbs - remains unsupported. I presume the root cause is that Lhakpa is not traditionally marketable, and brands want maximum visibility. She doesn’t have a curated Instagram presence. She’s a middle-aged woman of color, an immigrant single mother who speaks in broken English. She doesn’t exude “stoke”. She’s known to climb slowly on the lower slopes, at the advice of the Icefall Doctors, the Sherpas who manage the ropes and ladders over deep crevasses.In person, Lhakpa’s words are laced with intelligence and humor, and her passion for climbing is evident. “This is my gift,” she says of climbing. Though she would have liked to become a doctor or pilot in another life, she knows her talent is getting herself and others on top of some of the world’s largest peaks. Though Black Diamond sponsored an earlier climb, Lhakpa is currently without support.Her dream is to summit Everest in May 2020, followed by K2, a mountain whose summit once eluded her because of inclement weather. She knows this plan is ambitious, if not crazy. “All extreme athletes are crazy,” she says. “But I want to show the world I can do it. I want to show women who look like me that they can do it, too.”•••We take an easy hike on Talcott Mountain, a place she often goes with friends for a quick walk. She occasionally stops to place her hand on a rock face. We talk about the sounds of Everest, particularly the groaning ice. She shows me how she sleeps in a tent on the coldest nights, with her hands clasped underneath her body in the sleeping bag.Lhakpa began climbing in the same way many of her siblings and cousins did, helping an uncle move equipment for tourists on Makalu at 15, serving as a kitchen hand and porter. She says she was a tomboy, and that her mother worried she would never get married. She met her first husband on the mountain, and they moved to the United States in 2002. They often climbed together, until the relationship turned violent.> Climbing is my way out of washing dishes. It is the way to make a better life for the girlsIn 2004, her husband notoriously struck her on Everest, continuing a pattern of abuse that began upon the birth of their first child and continued on expeditions and at home. A difficult few years followed, with the family’s fortunes falling; by 2012 they were on food stamps. After further attacks, hospitalizations, and a stay at a shelter, the couple divorced, and Lhakpa was awarded full custody of the girls.I first learned about Lhakpa years ago, through the story of the 2004 climb, and have thought several times how damaging to her climbing career it must have been. She was forced to endure physical and emotional hardship in front of her professional community, and did not have the ability to control the public narrative. She left her marriage with no financial resources and two dependents. (Her oldest child, Nima, a son from another relationship, is now an adult.) She undoubtedly lost good climbing years to adversity, and yet her commitment to climbing persists.It has always seemed unfair to me to ask female athletes and artists about their marriage and children. Were the “great” male explorers of the past – or even the present – asked as often about how their children are cared for during an adventure, or if it’s OK to take certain risks – but to leave Lhakpa’s marriage and children out of the picture would perhaps be to hide one of her greatest challenges, and most profound motivations.“Climbing is my way out of washing dishes,” Lhakpa tells me. “It is the way to make a better life for the girls.”•••Lhakpa Sherpa: ‘If you don’t trust, you die.’ Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The GuardianAs we walk the well-worn paths of Talcott Mountain back to my car, Shiny becomes concerned about mosquitoes. “I don’t want you to get EEE when you’re out hiking,” she tells Lhakpa. I think about how difficult it must be to process the risks her mother takes, all while knowing her lifetime record of resilient comebacks. They look out for each other. Even when Lhakpa is posing for photographs at an outlook, she has one eye on her youngest daughter, and cautions her against stepping too close to the ridge line.Lhakpa and I talk about the difference between climbing Everest as a Sherpa, and as a climber. One you do for someone else, and the other you do for yourself. She expresses a moving amount of devotion to the clients Sherpas guide to the summit.“You make a promise,” she says, “and you keep it.” Lhakpa talks a lot about trust – trusting herself, trusting the climbing partner she’s tethered to, trusting the mountain. “If you don’t trust,” she says, “you die.”“I’m a small mouse climbing a big mountain,” Lhakpa tells me. Her relationship with the mountain is reverent, as if she’s in conversation with it. “Share with the mountain,” she says. “If you’re scared, your fear scares the mountain.” She even delayed 2019’s planned climb because of her beloved father’s death. “I didn’t want to carry the sadness,” she says. “It would not be safe.”When we get back to the apartment, Lhakpa shows me her boots and insulated Red Fox suit. “I look like a bear,” she says, slipping into the gear, which is reminiscent of a wearable sleeping bag. During climbing season, the temperatures on Everest’s summit range from -4F to -31F.Lhakpa displays the 50-year-old oxygen mask she wears because she says it’s more reliable than the new ones. Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The GuardianShe also wears a 50-year-old oxygen mask, because she believes it’s more reliable than the new ones. “I need smart students,” she says, asking me if I can find someone to design a better mask based on the old models. I picture a group of bright minds at MIT listening to this woman – this expert – who has grown up on the mountain and knows what climbers need as they step into the thin air of Everest.These are the other things Lhakpa wants: sponsorship for her historic 10th climb. Time to train and build her guiding business, Cloudscape Climbing. A life spent on the mountains and not cleaning dishes and taking out trash. A book and documentary about her life. Money to help send her bright daughters to college.“These are not quick dreams,” she adds. “They are long dreams.”Lhakpa has always worked hard to survive, and to subvert expectations. In the past, people have discounted the summits of Sherpas, saying that their familiarity with the altitude and location somehow diminishes the accomplishment. Lhakpa, who dared to step outside of a service culture and climb for herself, wants a 10th summit, and is serious about advancing her record.When I ask Shiny what she admires most about her mother, she pauses. “There is so much,” she says, her voice shaking. “But I would have to say her confidence.”Lhakpa is self-conscious of her hands, dried from washing dishes, and the jobs she must work in order to support her family. She is also driven to inspire others, particularly women and single parents. “I would like to hide in the mountain,” Lhakpa confesses on our descent, aware of her humble circumstances. “But I have to show my face here.”",http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aTsrZU.6T7nrIx0cghr9Rw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/924e3a16db3b93dd3a85bbed5207015e,She climbed Everest nine times and set a world record – so why doesn’t she have sponsors?
India Farmers Plan Nationwide Protest Against 16-Nation Trade Deal,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 08:50:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/india-farmers-plan-nationwide-protest-125007797.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. India’s farmers’ organizations have planned a nationwide protest on Nov. 4 to demand that the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi keep agriculture out of a 16-nation trade agreement currently being negotiated in Thailand.The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, an umbrella organization of about 250 farmers unions from across the country, said that they will burn effigies depicting the China-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership or RCEP, to mark their protest and warn the government.Indian farmers won’t be able to compete should the country agree to cut duties for agricultural and dairy products in the proposed trade pact, said V.M. Singh, a convener of the the farmers’ group. Imports of dairy and agricultural products including wheat, cotton and oil seeds would affect the livelihood of millions of Indian farmers, he said.The government should defer signing of the agreement and hold consultations with farmers, state governments and other stake holders before taking a final decision, said Singh. “We have to stop RCEP,” he said.It is not clear yet what terms India will agree to in order to join what could become the world’s largest trade deal. The final stage of negotiations have begun in Bangkok and Indian trade minister Piyush Goyal will travel for the ministerial meeting there on Nov. 1. The nations are seeking to conclude the negotiations by November end.To contact the reporter on this story: Bibhudatta Pradhan in New Delhi at bpradhan@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ruth Pollard at rpollard2@bloomberg.net, Muneeza Naqvi, Abhay SinghFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GF2o4tZmPCtqpE8IuBOemg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/38b9b9b23d04b76ac5ea78347d209b84,India Farmers Plan Nationwide Protest Against 16-Nation Trade Deal

Authorities Identify ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe’ Through DNA and Now the Real Questions Start,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:13:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/authorities-identify-fly-creek-jane-131307745.html,"On a chilly February Sunday in 1980, a father and son panning for gold along Fly Creek in Clark County, Washington, kicked up the remains of a human skeleton that appeared to have been buried in a shallow grave. They called the authorities who came to collect the skull and what bones hadn’t been dragged away by animals, and were able to use the remains to construct a facial reconstruction that produced a picture of a teenage girl. Detectives were able to deduce that she died from a cause that did not seem natural. Calls for information, searches through missing persons reports, and detective work turned up nothing. No one seemed to miss the teen, dubbed the ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe,’ and, for the last 40 years, that is as far as the case went–until now.This summer Clark County detectives decided to post a DNA sample from the old remains to the Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, a public genealogy database that has had recent success closing old cold cases. The lab found a tie to a distant cousin of a teen named Sandra “Sandy” Renee Morden who said she was last seen in 1977–three years before her skeletal remains were found. Courtesy of Clark County SheriffThe Oregonian then dug up an old birthday announcement that was tied to the case. On April 29, 1977, in the classified section of the paper, a tiny ad appeared that said: “Sandra Renee Morden, Happy 15th Birthday. Love Always—Mom.” Such published greetings were a common way to mark a birthday or anniversary in the era before Facebook and other social media. Morden’s parents were divorced, according to the DNA-linked cousin, who does not want to be named and who provided Clark County cold-case detective Lindsay Schultz with the only clues the teen’s life. Schultz told the Oregonian that Morden was a “latchkey kid” who was mostly “unsupervised.” There is no indication that the parents filed a missing persons report, and, as Schultz says, “We didn’t have [the National Crime Information Center] at that time.” The detective says Morden’s parents came from the San Francisco area and settled in Portland. They split up in the early 1970s, and did not communicate with each other. The girl’s mother, identified as Kathryn Irene Morden, apparently lost custody and the cousin said Sandy most often stayed with her father, identified as Andrew Bain Morden, a Marine Corps veteran who fought in the Korean War. Schultz says she likely fell through the cracks when one parent thought the other had her. She last attended Wilson High School in Portland. Schultz told the Oregonian that the father likely thought she was with her mother. He had left her alone for an extended period of time and when he came back, she was gone, so he assumed she had gone to her mother’s home. “We don’t know for certain,” Schultz says. “We know that’s what family members believe.”Both parents are dead, so there is no way to confirm what either of them knew. Schultz told the Oregonian that it is the birthday greeting that bothers him most. It was posted around the time the extended family says she disappeared. “Was it just a mom who loved her daughter–or did her mom know something and put it out there for that reason?” Schultz said. “It’s one of those two, right? You ponder it. You look at it and you think, ‘What does it mean?’”Now detectives are looking for the missing puzzle pieces. They are calling on anyone who might have any information about Morden, her parents, or how she might have died to contact the Clark County Medical Examiner's Office or Clark County Sheriff's Office Cold Case Tip Line.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

A Nobel Peace Prize for Vladimir Putin? That’s the Talk in Moscow.,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 05:40:49 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/nobel-peace-prize-vladimir-putin-094049080.html,"Adam Berry/GettyMOSCOW—For those who live outside Russia and the enormous bubble of admiration inflated around President Vladimir Putin, this story may be a bit hard to believe. But there is a movement afoot here, apparently in all sincerity, to nominate Putin for the Nobel Peace Prize.From the outside, one must wonder how the dossier for the former KGB operative might be prepared. Would it include the peace of the grave imposed on civilians in the Second Chechen War early in Putin’s presidency? Or would it be for backing quasi states broken away from the Republic of Georgia? Or, more recently, for the forcible annexation of Crimea and the instigation of a separatist war in Ukraine that continues to this day? Alex Gibney: How Donald Trump Is Morphing Into Vladimir PutinOr perhaps he’d win for Syria, where Putin is a strong supporter of the Assad dictatorship that has killed hundreds of thousands of people while half of the nation’s population has been driven into internal or external exile. Would that be the venue for Putin the peacemaker to earn his Nobel laurels?In fact, through the looking glass of Moscow’s media and Putin’s supporters, Ukraine and Syria are held up as prime examples of his eligibility for The Prize.The general secretary of the Russian-Turkish Public Forum, Sergey Markov, who is close to the Kremlin, tells The Daily Beast that there is no better candidate for the prestigious award than Putin: “Most Russian state officials believe that President Putin deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for saving the world from a nuclear war during the crisis in Ukraine in 2014—for holding back and not bringing Russian forces to Kharkiv, Dnepropetrovsk, [Ukrainian] cities full of Russian people,” Markov said, adding, “Of course Putin should be given the prize for solving the Turkish-Kurdish conflict, which risked taking thousands of lives.” Forget U.S. President Donald Trump’s efforts to claim credit for a ceasefire deal with Ankara, Putin’s supporters in Moscow believe that it was Putin alone who managed to find the solution and negotiate a deal with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that prevented a Turkish-Kurdish bloodbath. Whoever is responsible, the arrangement is essentially on Erdogan’s terms, opening the way for ethnic cleansing as Kurdish troops withdraw, Kurdish civilians flee, and Erdogan plans to move millions of Syrian Arabs, most of them from other parts of the country, into what Erdogan calls a “safe zone.”Yet Aleksey Venediktov, editor-in-chief of the influential independent radio station Echo of Moscow, tweeted last week as that deal came down: “They tell me at the top: ‘Now you understand, Putin deserves a Nobel Peace Prize.’” He said his high-level sources were telling him Putin’s Syria deal was like “the new Camp David Accord,” putting it on a par with the 1978 agreement brokered by President Jimmy Carter that ended generations of war between Israel and Egypt. In truth, the Russian leader has been looking to win The Prize for years. Ever since Time magazine put Putin on the cover as Person of the Year in 2007, the Kremlin’s ideologues have believed that the West recognizes Putin as the world’s preeminent politician—and peacemaker—and no wars in Georgia, Ukraine or Syria could dissuade them.Putin’s greatest accomplishment on that score probably came in 2013 when President Barack Obama was weighing the possibility of major military strikes on the Bashar al-Assad regime to retaliate for its use of chemical weapons, and Putin stepped in with a better—or at least more peaceful—plan. He persuaded Assad, first, to admit he had a chemical arsenal, which he had never done before. Then Assad agreed to U.N. inspections as he eliminated everything he admitted to having, and by all accounts the vast majority of those gruesome weapons were destroyed. At the time, that seemed like a major war averted, and therefore a pathway to peace.So at the beginning of 2014 a Russian advocacy group called the International Academy of Spiritual Unity and Cooperation of People put Putin up for the prize.Unfortunately for Putin’s aspirations, there’s quite a long delay between the nominations at the beginning of the year, and the awards at the end, and Putin was not exactly making peace in 2014. Reacting to a popular pro-European, largely anti-Russian uprising in Ukraine, he seized the Crimean Peninsula, annexed it to Russia, and poured support into separatist rebels in Eastern Ukraine. The death toll soon climbed into the thousands, with hundreds of thousands of people displaced. In July 2014 a Russian-supplied missile shot down a Malaysian Airliner en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur with 298 people on board, all of whom died.If anyone argued in 2014, as Markov suggests, that Putin should have gotten a peace prize for not staging a massive, direct invasion of Ukraine to take the large cities of Kharkiv and Dnepropetrovsk, the Nobel Committee in Norway clearly was not persuaded. It gave the 2014 prize to Kailash Satyarthi and Malala Yousafzai ""for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education.""Russia’s record in Syria has been equally bloody since it entered the fight directly to support Assad in 2015.  One recent example was a Russian-Syrian military strike on a center for hundreds of displaced people in the town of Haas in Idlib that killed 20 civilians in August. A Human Rights Watch investigation published in October qualified the attack as “an apparent war crime.” Sara Kayyali who monitors the violations on the ground for HRW, tells The Daily Beast that “Russian strikes on protected humanitarian infrastructure” have been common in the areas where they operate, with “severely negative consequences.”Now, says Kayyali, “Russia has brokered an agreement with Turkey around a so-called ‘safe zone,’ but as history has proved again and again, safe zones are rarely safe.” President Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov gloated last week, saying, ""The United States was the closest ally of the Kurds during the last few years, and in the end the U.S. ditched the Kurds and effectively betrayed them."" By arranging for the withdrawal of the fighters, Peskov suggested, Russia is at least saving their lives. The United States looks foolish and treacherous, to be sure. But some analysts suggest Russia’s schadenfreude is premature. David Aaron Miller at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace notes that among some in Washington, “Animosity toward Trump and Putin—richly deserved—is clouding the analysis on Syria  and triggering overreaction about Russia’s gains.”As Miller points out, “Russia has been the dominant external power in Syria since at least the 1970s. And the U.S. withdrawal has no doubt consolidated that and elevated Russia’s role in the region. But we shouldn’t overestimate Moscow’s gains.  They now preside over a broken country that will take years and billions to heal. They are shackled with a pariah regime—both entitled and dependent—that will continue to alienate the majority of the Sunni population; they face a resurgent ISIS and are now shackled with responsibility for managing both the Turkish-Syrian-Kurdish triangle and a potential Israeli-Iranian conflict.”“The idea of giving Putin a Nobel Peace Prize sounds ridiculous after years of this dirty war in Syria, the Russian military violating international law, using banned weapons, bombing hospitals and clinics,” Tania Lokshina, Europe and Central Asia associate director at Human Rights Watch Moscow, told The Daily Beast. But still the dream lives on, revived by the agreement moving the Kurds out of the region near the Turkish border. Last week the Russian news agency riafan.ru headlined: “Foreigners propose to award Putin with a Nobel Prize for peace in Syria.” The deadline for Nobel nominations is January 31.

Chris Christie Is Among Lawyers Reaping $15 Million in 1MDB Deal,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:33:49 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/chris-christie-among-lawyers-reaping-133349408.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest recovery ever from an American anti-corruption crackdown is proving lucrative for former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.A major deal struck by the U.S. for fugitive financier Jho Low to give up almost $1 billion in assets allegedly stolen from a Malaysian investment fund comes with a provision to pay his lawyers. As part of the 1MDB settlement, the Justice Department allowed for $15 million to be paid to a group advising Jho Low, including the law firm Christie set up after two terms as New Jersey’s governor.Those proceeds will come from Jho Low’s stake in EMI Music Publishing, which has grown to about $415 million. That investment ballooned after he initially put in a little more than $100 million stolen from 1MDB, according to prosecutors. The two sides agreed to the provision to allow the lawyers to extract fees from Low, whose assets and accounts have been seized or monitored by authorities across the world.“We were pleased to help negotiate this historic resolution in order to preserve the tremendous value of assets involved,” Christie said in a statement after the Justice Department announced the settlement agreement on Wednesday. It still needs approval from a federal judge.Christie, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 before dropping out and endorsing Donald Trump, set up his own law firm last year, the Christie Law Firm LLC. The other firms that will receive proceeds of the 1MDB deal for legal expenses are Kobre & Kim LLP and Lowenstein Sandler LLP.The agreement comes even before the criminal charges against Low have been resolved. In the settlement, the Justice Department cautioned that the released funds should be used only for the Low family’s legal fees and costs related to the lawsuits, and can’t be routed back to Low or his family.To contact the reporter on this story: Sridhar Natarajan in New York at snatarajan15@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

She climbed Everest nine times and set a world record – so why doesn’t she have sponsors?,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 02:00:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/she-climbed-everest-nine-times-060021913.html,"Lhakpa Sherpa works for minimum wages and currently washes dishes, as she trains for her 10th Everest summit with no endorsement deals, no nutritionist and no trainerLhakpa Sherpa in Talcott Mountain state park in Simsbury, Connecticut, where she hikes to prepare for her 10th summit of Everest in the spring of 2020. Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The GuardianI reach Lhakpa Sherpa’s West Hartford apartment at noon on an overcast Sunday in Connecticut. She bounds out of the front door, embraces me, and welcomes me inside. The small apartment is dimly lit. The living room has a few chairs, and a wall of sports medals from her two daughters’ 5Ks and gymnastic meets.Lhakpa was the first Nepalese woman to summit Everest and descend alive, which she accomplished in the spring of 2000. With nine summits, she holds the world record for women. She plans to summit the world’s highest mountain again in the spring of 2020, but as an unsponsored athlete and single mother of three, it’s difficult to afford training and travel. She currently works at Whole Foods washing dishes, making minimum wage. Unable to afford or drive a car, she walks to work and occasionally takes an Uber to training destinations.Sitting in her living room, I’m struck by her achievements – but also her lack of resources. How is it that a woman with such demonstrated accomplishment and skill is without sponsorship, and must risk nearly everything to continue to climb the Himalayan mountains she loves?Lhakpa makes tea while I chat with her 13-year-old daughter, Shiny, who – more fluent in technology and the English language – acts as her mother’s manager and occasional translator.“What’s it like for you,” I ask, “when your mother is away on an expedition?”> I want to show the world I can do it. I want to show women who look like me that they can do it, too.She turns her phone over in her hands. “It’s hard,” she says. “I’m proud of her, but I worry.” Each climbing season, six to 10 climbers die on the mountain.Everest expeditions last upwards of two months, usually in May, and there are only occasional opportunities to communicate via satellite phone and Skype. Avalanches, like the one that hit base camp in 2015, have kept them out of contact for weeks at a time.“I’m very good with the mountain,” Lhakpa says, bringing me a hot cup of tea, offering her warm smile. She has a long, lush ponytail and bright eyes. “I go, but I know I will come home. I have to come home.” She looks reassuringly at Shiny.Lhakpa, 45, grew up in Balakharka, a village in the Makalu region of the Nepalese Himalayas, where her father owned tea houses, and her mother still lives. Lhakpa tells me she isn’t sure of her exact age, as there were no birth certificates, and all of her mother’s 11 children were born at home. As a child, Lhakpa had no electricity, and young girls did not attend school.Lhapka Sherpa prepares tea at her home in West Hartford. Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The Guardian“You see my family on television,” she says. “Sherpas. Climbing Everest.” Her brother Mingma Gelu Sherpa directs an expedition outfitter in Kathmandu. Her oldest brother has summited “10 or 11 times,” she says. Another brother has summited eight times, her youngest brother five, and a sister has summited once.“If there weren’t any Sherpas,” she tells me, “nobody could climb Everest”.She worries when people say that anyone can climb Everest if they have the money – she’s heard people say that it’s just a matter of putting one foot in front of the other, and that Sherpas will do all the work. An average climb with a western outfitter costs upwards of $50,000, while a Nepalese outfitter costs upwards of $30,000.She has seen firsthand all the ways people can die on Everest: avalanches, falls, the thin air of the dead zone. Climbers must occasionally pass bodies, of which there are over a 100 on the mountain. (Bodies are dangerous to take down and doing so requires the effort of at least five sherpas.) Sherpas pass through the Khumbu icefall roughly 40 times just to make sure tourists have the supplies and ropes they need. If you spend enough time in the icefall, she says, you are guaranteed to die.“Why do we do this job?” she asks. “Because the alternative is to make money growing potatoes.”For Lhakpa, to say climbing Everest is easy is an insult. The fact that it is said at all reveals the problematic ways privilege has woven itself into adventure culture.Lhakpa Sherpa and her daughter Shiny, who says of her mother: ‘I’m proud of her, but I worry.’ Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The Guardian•••Serena Williams won the Australian Open while 23 weeks pregnant; Lhakpa Sherpa summited Everest eight months after the birth of her first child, and again while two months pregnant with Shiny.But unlike Williams, Lhakpa has no endorsement deals, no nutritionist, no trainer. She can’t afford to train full time, or much at all, because she works constantly in order to pay her rent.When she leaves her hourly jobs for climbing expeditions, she risks homelessness. When she returns, she picks up as much work as she can, working as a cashier at 7-Eleven and cleaning houses. “I never tell them about Everest,” she says, recounting a time when an employer realized that the woman mopping his floor was a world-renowned athlete.When I approached her for an interview, I asked her if we could hike together. As we prepare to leave for the walk, I notice that the grommet on Lhakpa’s hiking boots is broken, and she struggles to lace them. I’ve seen athletes with lesser accomplishments – but a higher number of Instagram followers – receive impressive amounts of free gear. Lhakpa mentions that her worn, orange Osprey backpack has summited Everest at least twice.Lhakpa Sherpa in 2006, when she broke her own record for the most Everest summits by a woman. Photograph: Prakash Mathema/AFP/GettyIn an era where many organizations profess a desire to diversify outdoors culture, it is difficult to process that such an accomplished athlete – with an authentic connection to the place she climbs - remains unsupported. I presume the root cause is that Lhakpa is not traditionally marketable, and brands want maximum visibility. She doesn’t have a curated Instagram presence. She’s a middle-aged woman of color, an immigrant single mother who speaks in broken English. She doesn’t exude “stoke”. She’s known to climb slowly on the lower slopes, at the advice of the Icefall Doctors, the Sherpas who manage the ropes and ladders over deep crevasses.In person, Lhakpa’s words are laced with intelligence and humor, and her passion for climbing is evident. “This is my gift,” she says of climbing. Though she would have liked to become a doctor or pilot in another life, she knows her talent is getting herself and others on top of some of the world’s largest peaks. Though Black Diamond sponsored an earlier climb, Lhakpa is currently without support.Her dream is to summit Everest in May 2020, followed by K2, a mountain whose summit once eluded her because of inclement weather. She knows this plan is ambitious, if not crazy. “All extreme athletes are crazy,” she says. “But I want to show the world I can do it. I want to show women who look like me that they can do it, too.”•••We take an easy hike on Talcott Mountain, a place she often goes with friends for a quick walk. She occasionally stops to place her hand on a rock face. We talk about the sounds of Everest, particularly the groaning ice. She shows me how she sleeps in a tent on the coldest nights, with her hands clasped underneath her body in the sleeping bag.Lhakpa began climbing in the same way many of her siblings and cousins did, helping an uncle move equipment for tourists on Makalu at 15, serving as a kitchen hand and porter. She says she was a tomboy, and that her mother worried she would never get married. She met her first husband on the mountain, and they moved to the United States in 2002. They often climbed together, until the relationship turned violent.> Climbing is my way out of washing dishes. It is the way to make a better life for the girlsIn 2004, her husband notoriously struck her on Everest, continuing a pattern of abuse that began upon the birth of their first child and continued on expeditions and at home. A difficult few years followed, with the family’s fortunes falling; by 2012 they were on food stamps. After further attacks, hospitalizations, and a stay at a shelter, the couple divorced, and Lhakpa was awarded full custody of the girls.I first learned about Lhakpa years ago, through the story of the 2004 climb, and have thought several times how damaging to her climbing career it must have been. She was forced to endure physical and emotional hardship in front of her professional community, and did not have the ability to control the public narrative. She left her marriage with no financial resources and two dependents. (Her oldest child, Nima, a son from another relationship, is now an adult.) She undoubtedly lost good climbing years to adversity, and yet her commitment to climbing persists.It has always seemed unfair to me to ask female athletes and artists about their marriage and children. Were the “great” male explorers of the past – or even the present – asked as often about how their children are cared for during an adventure, or if it’s OK to take certain risks – but to leave Lhakpa’s marriage and children out of the picture would perhaps be to hide one of her greatest challenges, and most profound motivations.“Climbing is my way out of washing dishes,” Lhakpa tells me. “It is the way to make a better life for the girls.”•••Lhakpa Sherpa: ‘If you don’t trust, you die.’ Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The GuardianAs we walk the well-worn paths of Talcott Mountain back to my car, Shiny becomes concerned about mosquitoes. “I don’t want you to get EEE when you’re out hiking,” she tells Lhakpa. I think about how difficult it must be to process the risks her mother takes, all while knowing her lifetime record of resilient comebacks. They look out for each other. Even when Lhakpa is posing for photographs at an outlook, she has one eye on her youngest daughter, and cautions her against stepping too close to the ridge line.Lhakpa and I talk about the difference between climbing Everest as a Sherpa, and as a climber. One you do for someone else, and the other you do for yourself. She expresses a moving amount of devotion to the clients Sherpas guide to the summit.“You make a promise,” she says, “and you keep it.” Lhakpa talks a lot about trust – trusting herself, trusting the climbing partner she’s tethered to, trusting the mountain. “If you don’t trust,” she says, “you die.”“I’m a small mouse climbing a big mountain,” Lhakpa tells me. Her relationship with the mountain is reverent, as if she’s in conversation with it. “Share with the mountain,” she says. “If you’re scared, your fear scares the mountain.” She even delayed 2019’s planned climb because of her beloved father’s death. “I didn’t want to carry the sadness,” she says. “It would not be safe.”When we get back to the apartment, Lhakpa shows me her boots and insulated Red Fox suit. “I look like a bear,” she says, slipping into the gear, which is reminiscent of a wearable sleeping bag. During climbing season, the temperatures on Everest’s summit range from -4F to -31F.Lhakpa displays the 50-year-old oxygen mask she wears because she says it’s more reliable than the new ones. Photograph: Kayana Szymczak/The GuardianShe also wears a 50-year-old oxygen mask, because she believes it’s more reliable than the new ones. “I need smart students,” she says, asking me if I can find someone to design a better mask based on the old models. I picture a group of bright minds at MIT listening to this woman – this expert – who has grown up on the mountain and knows what climbers need as they step into the thin air of Everest.These are the other things Lhakpa wants: sponsorship for her historic 10th climb. Time to train and build her guiding business, Cloudscape Climbing. A life spent on the mountains and not cleaning dishes and taking out trash. A book and documentary about her life. Money to help send her bright daughters to college.“These are not quick dreams,” she adds. “They are long dreams.”Lhakpa has always worked hard to survive, and to subvert expectations. In the past, people have discounted the summits of Sherpas, saying that their familiarity with the altitude and location somehow diminishes the accomplishment. Lhakpa, who dared to step outside of a service culture and climb for herself, wants a 10th summit, and is serious about advancing her record.When I ask Shiny what she admires most about her mother, she pauses. “There is so much,” she says, her voice shaking. “But I would have to say her confidence.”Lhakpa is self-conscious of her hands, dried from washing dishes, and the jobs she must work in order to support her family. She is also driven to inspire others, particularly women and single parents. “I would like to hide in the mountain,” Lhakpa confesses on our descent, aware of her humble circumstances. “But I have to show my face here.”",http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aTsrZU.6T7nrIx0cghr9Rw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/924e3a16db3b93dd3a85bbed5207015e,She climbed Everest nine times and set a world record – so why doesn’t she have sponsors?
India Farmers Plan Nationwide Protest Against 16-Nation Trade Deal,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 08:50:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/india-farmers-plan-nationwide-protest-125007797.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. India’s farmers’ organizations have planned a nationwide protest on Nov. 4 to demand that the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi keep agriculture out of a 16-nation trade agreement currently being negotiated in Thailand.The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, an umbrella organization of about 250 farmers unions from across the country, said that they will burn effigies depicting the China-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership or RCEP, to mark their protest and warn the government.Indian farmers won’t be able to compete should the country agree to cut duties for agricultural and dairy products in the proposed trade pact, said V.M. Singh, a convener of the the farmers’ group.

Authorities Identify ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe’ Through DNA and Now the Real Questions Start,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:13:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/authorities-identify-fly-creek-jane-131307745.html,"On a chilly February Sunday in 1980, a father and son panning for gold along Fly Creek in Clark County, Washington, kicked up the remains of a human skeleton that appeared to have been buried in a shallow grave. They called the authorities who came to collect the skull and what bones hadn’t been dragged away by animals, and were able to use the remains to construct a facial reconstruction that produced a picture of a teenage girl. Detectives were able to deduce that she died from a cause that did not seem natural. Calls for information, searches through missing persons reports, and detective work turned up nothing. No one seemed to miss the teen, dubbed the ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe,’ and, for the last 40 years, that is as far as the case went–until now.This summer Clark County detectives decided to post a DNA sample from the old remains to the Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, a public genealogy database that has had recent success closing old cold cases. The lab found a tie to a distant cousin of a teen named Sandra “Sandy” Renee Morden who said she was last seen in 1977–three years before her skeletal remains were found. Courtesy of Clark County SheriffThe Oregonian then dug up an old birthday announcement that was tied to the case. On April 29, 1977, in the classified section of the paper, a tiny ad appeared that said: “Sandra Renee Morden, Happy 15th Birthday. Love Always—Mom.” Such published greetings were a common way to mark a birthday or anniversary in the era before Facebook and other social media. Morden’s parents were divorced, according to the DNA-linked cousin, who does not want to be named and who provided Clark County cold-case detective Lindsay Schultz with the only clues the teen’s life. Schultz told the Oregonian that Morden was a “latchkey kid” who was mostly “unsupervised.” There is no indication that the parents filed a missing persons report, and, as Schultz says, “We didn’t have [the National Crime Information Center] at that time.” The detective says Morden’s parents came from the San Francisco area and settled in Portland. They split up in the early 1970s, and did not communicate with each other. The girl’s mother, identified as Kathryn Irene Morden, apparently lost custody and the cousin said Sandy most often stayed with her father, identified as Andrew Bain Morden, a Marine Corps veteran who fought in the Korean War. Schultz says she likely fell through the cracks when one parent thought the other had her. She last attended Wilson High School in Portland. Schultz told the Oregonian that the father likely thought she was with her mother. He had left her alone for an extended period of time and when he came back, she was gone, so he assumed she had gone to her mother’s home. “We don’t know for certain,” Schultz says. “We know that’s what family members believe.”Both parents are dead, so there is no way to confirm what either of them knew. Schultz told the Oregonian that it is the birthday greeting that bothers him most. It was posted around the time the extended family says she disappeared. “Was it just a mom who loved her daughter–or did her mom know something and put it out there for that reason?” Schultz said. “It’s one of those two, right? You ponder it. You look at it and you think, ‘What does it mean?’”Now detectives are looking for the missing puzzle pieces. They are calling on anyone who might have any information about Morden, her parents, or how she might have died to contact the Clark County Medical Examiner's Office or Clark County Sheriff's Office Cold Case Tip Line.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

A Nobel Peace Prize for Vladimir Putin? That’s the Talk in Moscow.,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 05:40:49 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/nobel-peace-prize-vladimir-putin-094049080.html,"Adam Berry/GettyMOSCOW—For those who live outside Russia and the enormous bubble of admiration inflated around President Vladimir Putin, this story may be a bit hard to believe. But there is a movement afoot here, apparently in all sincerity, to nominate Putin for the Nobel Peace Prize.From the outside, one must wonder how the dossier for the former KGB operative might be prepared. Would it include the peace of the grave imposed on civilians in the Second Chechen War early in Putin’s presidency? Or would it be for backing quasi states broken away from the Republic of Georgia? Or, more recently, for the forcible annexation of Crimea and the instigation of a separatist war in Ukraine that continues to this day? Alex Gibney: How Donald Trump Is Morphing Into Vladimir PutinOr perhaps he’d win for Syria, where Putin is a strong supporter of the Assad dictatorship that has killed hundreds of thousands of people while half of the nation’s population has been driven into internal or external exile. Would that be the venue for Putin the peacemaker to earn his Nobel laurels?In fact, through the looking glass of Moscow’s media and Putin’s supporters, Ukraine and Syria are held up as prime examples of his eligibility for The Prize.The general secretary of the Russian-Turkish Public Forum, Sergey Markov, who is close to the Kremlin, tells The Daily Beast that there is no better candidate for the prestigious award than Putin: “Most Russian state officials believe that President Putin deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for saving the world from a nuclear war during the crisis in Ukraine in 2014—for holding back and not bringing Russian forces to Kharkiv, Dnepropetrovsk, [Ukrainian] cities full of Russian people,” Markov said, adding, “Of course Putin should be given the prize for solving the Turkish-Kurdish conflict, which risked taking thousands of lives.” Forget U.S. President Donald Trump’s efforts to claim credit for a ceasefire deal with Ankara, Putin’s supporters in Moscow believe that it was Putin alone who managed to find the solution and negotiate a deal with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that prevented a Turkish-Kurdish bloodbath. Whoever is responsible, the arrangement is essentially on Erdogan’s terms, opening the way for ethnic cleansing as Kurdish troops withdraw, Kurdish civilians flee, and Erdogan plans to move millions of Syrian Arabs, most of them from other parts of the country, into what Erdogan calls a “safe zone.”Yet Aleksey Venediktov, editor-in-chief of the influential independent radio station Echo of Moscow, tweeted last week as that deal came down: “They tell me at the top: ‘Now you understand, Putin deserves a Nobel Peace Prize.’” He said his high-level sources were telling him Putin’s Syria deal was like “the new Camp David Accord,” putting it on a par with the 1978 agreement brokered by President Jimmy Carter that ended generations of war between Israel and Egypt. In truth, the Russian leader has been looking to win The Prize for years. Ever since Time magazine put Putin on the cover as Person of the Year in 2007, the Kremlin’s ideologues have believed that the West recognizes Putin as the world’s preeminent politician—and peacemaker—and no wars in Georgia, Ukraine or Syria could dissuade them.Putin’s greatest accomplishment on that score probably came in 2013 when President Barack Obama was weighing the possibility of major military strikes on the Bashar al-Assad regime to retaliate for its use of chemical weapons, and Putin stepped in with a better—or at least more peaceful—plan. He persuaded Assad, first, to admit he had a chemical arsenal, which he had never done before. Then Assad agreed to U.N. inspections as he eliminated everything he admitted to having, and by all accounts the vast majority of those gruesome weapons were destroyed. At the time, that seemed like a major war averted, and therefore a pathway to peace.So at the beginning of 2014 a Russian advocacy group called the International Academy of Spiritual Unity and Cooperation of People put Putin up for the prize.Unfortunately for Putin’s aspirations, there’s quite a long delay between the nominations at the beginning of the year, and the awards at the end, and Putin was not exactly making peace in 2014. Reacting to a popular pro-European, largely anti-Russian uprising in Ukraine, he seized the Crimean Peninsula, annexed it to Russia, and poured support into separatist rebels in Eastern Ukraine. The death toll soon climbed into the thousands, with hundreds of thousands of people displaced. In July 2014 a Russian-supplied missile shot down a Malaysian Airliner en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur with 298 people on board, all of whom died.If anyone argued in 2014, as Markov suggests, that Putin should have gotten a peace prize for not staging a massive, direct invasion of Ukraine to take the large cities of Kharkiv and Dnepropetrovsk, the Nobel Committee in Norway clearly was not persuaded. It gave the 2014 prize to Kailash Satyarthi and Malala Yousafzai ""for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education.""Russia’s record in Syria has been equally bloody since it entered the fight directly to support Assad in 2015.  One recent example was a Russian-Syrian military strike on a center for hundreds of displaced people in the town of Haas in Idlib that killed 20 civilians in August. A Human Rights Watch investigation published in October qualified the attack as “an apparent war crime.” Sara Kayyali who monitors the violations on the ground for HRW, tells The Daily Beast that “Russian strikes on protected humanitarian infrastructure” have been common in the areas where they operate, with “severely negative consequences.”Now, says Kayyali, “Russia has brokered an agreement with Turkey around a so-called ‘safe zone,’ but as history has proved again and again, safe zones are rarely safe.” President Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov gloated last week, saying, ""The United States was the closest ally of the Kurds during the last few years, and in the end the U.S. ditched the Kurds and effectively betrayed them."" By arranging for the withdrawal of the fighters, Peskov suggested, Russia is at least saving their lives. The United States looks foolish and treacherous, to be sure. But some analysts suggest Russia’s schadenfreude is premature. David Aaron Miller at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace notes that among some in Washington, “Animosity toward Trump and Putin—richly deserved—is clouding the analysis on Syria  and triggering overreaction about Russia’s gains.”As Miller points out, “Russia has been the dominant external power in Syria since at least the 1970s. And the U.S. withdrawal has no doubt consolidated that and elevated Russia’s role in the region. But we shouldn’t overestimate Moscow’s gains.  They now preside over a broken country that will take years and billions to heal. They are shackled with a pariah regime—both entitled and dependent—that will continue to alienate the majority of the Sunni population; they face a resurgent ISIS and are now shackled with responsibility for managing both the Turkish-Syrian-Kurdish triangle and a potential Israeli-Iranian conflict.”“The idea of giving Putin a Nobel Peace Prize sounds ridiculous after years of this dirty war in Syria, the Russian military violating international law, using banned weapons, bombing hospitals and clinics,” Tania Lokshina, Europe and Central Asia associate director at Human Rights Watch Moscow, told The Daily Beast. But still the dream lives on, revived by the agreement moving the Kurds out of the region near the Turkish border. Last week the Russian news agency riafan.ru headlined: “Foreigners propose to award Putin with a Nobel Prize for peace in Syria.” The deadline for Nobel nominations is January 31. One can only guess at the peace initiatives Putin will carry out between now and then.Is Trump Saving Those Syrian Oil Fields for the Russians?Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Why the Tories are cruising toward a big win in Britain,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 05:50:02 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/why-tories-cruising-toward-big-095002680.html,"The polling is clear. Over the more than three years since they voted to leave the European Union, British voters have come to regret their choice. Polls consistently show a several-point margin in favor of Remain, only one in three voters will endorse the proposition that getting Brexit over with is better than further delay, and two thirds believe that a no-deal Brexit should require another referendum.So why are Boris Johnson's Tories, running on a clearer stance for Brexit than ever before, currently projected to win a decisive victory in the December election?The simplest answer is: the opposition is divided. But that answer obscures more than it reveals, because it presumes that the question of Brexit is as dominant among the opposition as it is among the Tories. And the division of the opposition itself proves that this is not the case. On the contrary: Brexit is a truly existential question for a far larger fraction of Leave voters than it is of Remain voters, and that has had and continues to have material electoral consequences.Consider the largest opposition party. Labour under Jeremy Corbin has trended in an overwhelmingly left-wing direction, not only on economic matters but also on immigration and foreign policy. A ""no enemies on the left"" approach has even seen extremist illiberal and anti-Semitic elements gain a greater foothold within the party. But on Brexit, Corbyn has taken a somewhat ambiguous stance, reflecting the fact that while a majority of Labourites voted Remain, a not insignificant number had always been skeptical of an economic arrangement that gave financial interests greater influence at both the national and European levels of government.That combination of stridency and straddle hasn't played well in electoral terms, and has opened space for two other parties to establish themselves as alternatives: the Liberal Democrats, a longstanding centrist liberal party that has positioned itself as the unequivocal party of Remain, and the Brexit Party, a newly-minted political faction founded by Nigel Farage, the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party. At one point this past summer, both parties looked capable of surpassing the Tories, and possibly Labour as well.Since Boris Johnson took the premiership, though, the picture has changed dramatically. The Brexit party has fallen back to 10-12 percent in the polls, while the Tories have surged to the mid-to-high 30s. Moreover, Farage has intimated that he might cooperate with the Tories strategically, targeting constituencies where left-wing Leave voters are concentrated to pull them away from Labour, while staying away from seats that would be contested between the Remain-oriented Liberal Democrats and the Leave-oriented Tories.How could such a strategy work if Brexit is only getting less-popular with time? The answer comes down to intensity and cohesion.If Tory Remain voters -- of which there were many -- cared more about stopping Brexit than they did about the fate of their party, they would defect to the Liberal Democrats, badly damaging the Tories' chances of winning a majority. Similarly, if Labour Remain voters felt that Brexit was the most important issue, they would either have pushed Corbyn to a more decisive Remain stance, or would be working strategically with the Liberal Democrats in the way that the Brexit Party may work with the Tories. And the Liberal Democrats would be doing the same.But while Brexit may be a politically-defining event for the liberal center, for the left this is their first chance at power since the 1970s -- not something to be traded away lightly for the sake of free trade with Germany or even stability in Ireland. Even for liberal centrists, the choice between Corbyn and Johnson may be a tough one. For the right, meanwhile, the party as a whole seems to have come to realize that while the hard Leave voters are a minority in the country, they hold the balance of power within the Tory coalition. If they are not given the wheel, the coach isn't going anywhere.Now they have the wheel, and a Leave coalition looks likely to triumph decisively, in spite of all regrets.What happens then? The opposition could continue to come up with explanations for why the result doesn't truly reflect the will of the people -- blaming the electoral system, for instance (though in current polling the Tory-plus-Brexit coalition outpolls Labour-plus-Lib-Dems by an average of five points, suggesting even proportional representation would give victory to the Brexiteers). But they would be wiser to focus on the future. No longer dependent on the votes of Irish Unionists, nor needing to cater to the concerns of the Scottish Nationalists, a big Tory majority could govern from the center of England rather than Britain.The biggest post-Brexit challenge may not be how to get Britain back into Europe, but how to hold Britain itself together.Want more essential commentary and analysis like this delivered straight to your inbox?

Chris Christie Is Among Lawyers Reaping $15 Million in 1MDB Deal,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:33:49 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/chris-christie-among-lawyers-reaping-133349408.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest recovery ever from an American anti-corruption crackdown is proving lucrative for former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.A major deal struck by the U.S. for fugitive financier Jho Low to give up almost $1 billion in assets allegedly stolen from a Malaysian investment fund comes with a provision to pay his lawyers. As part of the 1MDB settlement, the Justice Department allowed for $15 million to be paid to a group advising Jho Low, including the law firm Christie set up after two terms as New Jersey’s governor.Those proceeds will come from Jho Low’s stake in EMI Music Publishing, which has grown to about $415 million. That investment ballooned after he initially put in a little more than $100 million stolen from 1MDB, according to prosecutors. The two sides agreed to the provision to allow the lawyers to extract fees from Low, whose assets and accounts have been seized or monitored by authorities across the world.“We were pleased to help negotiate this historic resolution in order to preserve the tremendous value of assets involved,” Christie said in a statement after the Justice Department announced the settlement agreement on Wednesday. It still needs approval from a federal judge.Christie, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 before dropping out and endorsing Donald Trump, set up his own law firm last year, the Christie Law Firm LLC. The other firms that will receive proceeds of the 1MDB deal for legal expenses are Kobre & Kim LLP and Lowenstein Sandler LLP.The agreement comes even before the criminal charges against Low have been resolved. In the settlement, the Justice Department cautioned that the released funds should be used only for the Low family’s legal fees and costs related to the lawsuits, and can’t be routed back to Low or his family.To contact the reporter on this story: Sridhar Natarajan in New York at snatarajan15@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

India Farmers Plan Nationwide Protest Against 16-Nation Trade Deal,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 08:50:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/india-farmers-plan-nationwide-protest-125007797.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. India’s farmers’ organizations have planned a nationwide protest on Nov. 4 to demand that the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi keep agriculture out of a 16-nation trade agreement currently being negotiated in Thailand.The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, an umbrella organization of about 250 farmers unions from across the country, said that they will burn effigies depicting the China-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership or RCEP, to mark their protest and warn the government.Indian farmers won’t be able to compete should the country agree to cut duties for agricultural and dairy products in the proposed trade pact, said V.M. Singh, a convener of the the farmers’ group.

Authorities Identify ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe’ Through DNA and Now the Real Questions Start,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:13:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/authorities-identify-fly-creek-jane-131307745.html,"On a chilly February Sunday in 1980, a father and son panning for gold along Fly Creek in Clark County, Washington, kicked up the remains of a human skeleton that appeared to have been buried in a shallow grave. They called the authorities who came to collect the skull and what bones hadn’t been dragged away by animals, and were able to use the remains to construct a facial reconstruction that produced a picture of a teenage girl. Detectives were able to deduce that she died from a cause that did not seem natural. Calls for information, searches through missing persons reports, and detective work turned up nothing. No one seemed to miss the teen, dubbed the ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe,’ and, for the last 40 years, that is as far as the case went–until now.This summer Clark County detectives decided to post a DNA sample from the old remains to the Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, a public genealogy database that has had recent success closing old cold cases. The lab found a tie to a distant cousin of a teen named Sandra “Sandy” Renee Morden who said she was last seen in 1977–three years before her skeletal remains were found. Courtesy of Clark County SheriffThe Oregonian then dug up an old birthday announcement that was tied to the case. On April 29, 1977, in the classified section of the paper, a tiny ad appeared that said: “Sandra Renee Morden, Happy 15th Birthday. Love Always—Mom.” Such published greetings were a common way to mark a birthday or anniversary in the era before Facebook and other social media. Morden’s parents were divorced, according to the DNA-linked cousin, who does not want to be named and who provided Clark County cold-case detective Lindsay Schultz with the only clues the teen’s life. Schultz told the Oregonian that Morden was a “latchkey kid” who was mostly “unsupervised.” There is no indication that the parents filed a missing persons report, and, as Schultz says, “We didn’t have [the National Crime Information Center] at that time.” The detective says Morden’s parents came from the San Francisco area and settled in Portland. They split up in the early 1970s, and did not communicate with each other. The girl’s mother, identified as Kathryn Irene Morden, apparently lost custody and the cousin said Sandy most often stayed with her father, identified as Andrew Bain Morden, a Marine Corps veteran who fought in the Korean War. Schultz says she likely fell through the cracks when one parent thought the other had her. She last attended Wilson High School in Portland. Schultz told the Oregonian that the father likely thought she was with her mother. He had left her alone for an extended period of time and when he came back, she was gone, so he assumed she had gone to her mother’s home. “We don’t know for certain,” Schultz says. “We know that’s what family members believe.”Both parents are dead, so there is no way to confirm what either of them knew. Schultz told the Oregonian that it is the birthday greeting that bothers him most. It was posted around the time the extended family says she disappeared. “Was it just a mom who loved her daughter–or did her mom know something and put it out there for that reason?” Schultz said. “It’s one of those two, right? You ponder it. You look at it and you think, ‘What does it mean?’”Now detectives are looking for the missing puzzle pieces. They are calling on anyone who might have any information about Morden, her parents, or how she might have died to contact the Clark County Medical Examiner's Office or Clark County Sheriff's Office Cold Case Tip Line.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

A Nobel Peace Prize for Vladimir Putin? That’s the Talk in Moscow.,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 05:40:49 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/nobel-peace-prize-vladimir-putin-094049080.html,"Adam Berry/GettyMOSCOW—For those who live outside Russia and the enormous bubble of admiration inflated around President Vladimir Putin, this story may be a bit hard to believe. But there is a movement afoot here, apparently in all sincerity, to nominate Putin for the Nobel Peace Prize.From the outside, one must wonder how the dossier for the former KGB operative might be prepared. Would it include the peace of the grave imposed on civilians in the Second Chechen War early in Putin’s presidency? Or would it be for backing quasi states broken away from the Republic of Georgia? Or, more recently, for the forcible annexation of Crimea and the instigation of a separatist war in Ukraine that continues to this day? Alex Gibney: How Donald Trump Is Morphing Into Vladimir PutinOr perhaps he’d win for Syria, where Putin is a strong supporter of the Assad dictatorship that has killed hundreds of thousands of people while half of the nation’s population has been driven into internal or external exile. Would that be the venue for Putin the peacemaker to earn his Nobel laurels?In fact, through the looking glass of Moscow’s media and Putin’s supporters, Ukraine and Syria are held up as prime examples of his eligibility for The Prize.The general secretary of the Russian-Turkish Public Forum, Sergey Markov, who is close to the Kremlin, tells The Daily Beast that there is no better candidate for the prestigious award than Putin: “Most Russian state officials believe that President Putin deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for saving the world from a nuclear war during the crisis in Ukraine in 2014—for holding back and not bringing Russian forces to Kharkiv, Dnepropetrovsk, [Ukrainian] cities full of Russian people,” Markov said, adding, “Of course Putin should be given the prize for solving the Turkish-Kurdish conflict, which risked taking thousands of lives.” Forget U.S. President Donald Trump’s efforts to claim credit for a ceasefire deal with Ankara, Putin’s supporters in Moscow believe that it was Putin alone who managed to find the solution and negotiate a deal with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that prevented a Turkish-Kurdish bloodbath. Whoever is responsible, the arrangement is essentially on Erdogan’s terms, opening the way for ethnic cleansing as Kurdish troops withdraw, Kurdish civilians flee, and Erdogan plans to move millions of Syrian Arabs, most of them from other parts of the country, into what Erdogan calls a “safe zone.”Yet Aleksey Venediktov, editor-in-chief of the influential independent radio station Echo of Moscow, tweeted last week as that deal came down: “They tell me at the top: ‘Now you understand, Putin deserves a Nobel Peace Prize.’” He said his high-level sources were telling him Putin’s Syria deal was like “the new Camp David Accord,” putting it on a par with the 1978 agreement brokered by President Jimmy Carter that ended generations of war between Israel and Egypt. In truth, the Russian leader has been looking to win The Prize for years. Ever since Time magazine put Putin on the cover as Person of the Year in 2007, the Kremlin’s ideologues have believed that the West recognizes Putin as the world’s preeminent politician—and peacemaker—and no wars in Georgia, Ukraine or Syria could dissuade them.Putin’s greatest accomplishment on that score probably came in 2013 when President Barack Obama was weighing the possibility of major military strikes on the Bashar al-Assad regime to retaliate for its use of chemical weapons, and Putin stepped in with a better—or at least more peaceful—plan. He persuaded Assad, first, to admit he had a chemical arsenal, which he had never done before. Then Assad agreed to U.N. inspections as he eliminated everything he admitted to having, and by all accounts the vast majority of those gruesome weapons were destroyed. At the time, that seemed like a major war averted, and therefore a pathway to peace.So at the beginning of 2014 a Russian advocacy group called the International Academy of Spiritual Unity and Cooperation of People put Putin up for the prize.Unfortunately for Putin’s aspirations, there’s quite a long delay between the nominations at the beginning of the year, and the awards at the end, and Putin was not exactly making peace in 2014. Reacting to a popular pro-European, largely anti-Russian uprising in Ukraine, he seized the Crimean Peninsula, annexed it to Russia, and poured support into separatist rebels in Eastern Ukraine. The death toll soon climbed into the thousands, with hundreds of thousands of people displaced. In July 2014 a Russian-supplied missile shot down a Malaysian Airliner en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur with 298 people on board, all of whom died.If anyone argued in 2014, as Markov suggests, that Putin should have gotten a peace prize for not staging a massive, direct invasion of Ukraine to take the large cities of Kharkiv and Dnepropetrovsk, the Nobel Committee in Norway clearly was not persuaded. It gave the 2014 prize to Kailash Satyarthi and Malala Yousafzai ""for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education.""Russia’s record in Syria has been equally bloody since it entered the fight directly to support Assad in 2015.  One recent example was a Russian-Syrian military strike on a center for hundreds of displaced people in the town of Haas in Idlib that killed 20 civilians in August. A Human Rights Watch investigation published in October qualified the attack as “an apparent war crime.” Sara Kayyali who monitors the violations on the ground for HRW, tells The Daily Beast that “Russian strikes on protected humanitarian infrastructure” have been common in the areas where they operate, with “severely negative consequences.”Now, says Kayyali, “Russia has brokered an agreement with Turkey around a so-called ‘safe zone,’ but as history has proved again and again, safe zones are rarely safe.” President Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov gloated last week, saying, ""The United States was the closest ally of the Kurds during the last few years, and in the end the U.S. ditched the Kurds and effectively betrayed them."" By arranging for the withdrawal of the fighters, Peskov suggested, Russia is at least saving their lives. The United States looks foolish and treacherous, to be sure. But some analysts suggest Russia’s schadenfreude is premature. David Aaron Miller at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace notes that among some in Washington, “Animosity toward Trump and Putin—richly deserved—is clouding the analysis on Syria  and triggering overreaction about Russia’s gains.”As Miller points out, “Russia has been the dominant external power in Syria since at least the 1970s. And the U.S. withdrawal has no doubt consolidated that and elevated Russia’s role in the region. But we shouldn’t overestimate Moscow’s gains.  They now preside over a broken country that will take years and billions to heal. They are shackled with a pariah regime—both entitled and dependent—that will continue to alienate the majority of the Sunni population; they face a resurgent ISIS and are now shackled with responsibility for managing both the Turkish-Syrian-Kurdish triangle and a potential Israeli-Iranian conflict.”“The idea of giving Putin a Nobel Peace Prize sounds ridiculous after years of this dirty war in Syria, the Russian military violating international law, using banned weapons, bombing hospitals and clinics,” Tania Lokshina, Europe and Central Asia associate director at Human Rights Watch Moscow, told The Daily Beast. But still the dream lives on, revived by the agreement moving the Kurds out of the region near the Turkish border. Last week the Russian news agency riafan.ru headlined: “Foreigners propose to award Putin with a Nobel Prize for peace in Syria.” The deadline for Nobel nominations is January 31. One can only guess at the peace initiatives Putin will carry out between now and then.Is Trump Saving Those Syrian Oil Fields for the Russians?Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Why the Tories are cruising toward a big win in Britain,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 05:50:02 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/why-tories-cruising-toward-big-095002680.html,"The polling is clear. Over the more than three years since they voted to leave the European Union, British voters have come to regret their choice. Polls consistently show a several-point margin in favor of Remain, only one in three voters will endorse the proposition that getting Brexit over with is better than further delay, and two thirds believe that a no-deal Brexit should require another referendum.So why are Boris Johnson's Tories, running on a clearer stance for Brexit than ever before, currently projected to win a decisive victory in the December election?The simplest answer is: the opposition is divided. But that answer obscures more than it reveals, because it presumes that the question of Brexit is as dominant among the opposition as it is among the Tories. And the division of the opposition itself proves that this is not the case. On the contrary: Brexit is a truly existential question for a far larger fraction of Leave voters than it is of Remain voters, and that has had and continues to have material electoral consequences.Consider the largest opposition party. Labour under Jeremy Corbin has trended in an overwhelmingly left-wing direction, not only on economic matters but also on immigration and foreign policy. A ""no enemies on the left"" approach has even seen extremist illiberal and anti-Semitic elements gain a greater foothold within the party. But on Brexit, Corbyn has taken a somewhat ambiguous stance, reflecting the fact that while a majority of Labourites voted Remain, a not insignificant number had always been skeptical of an economic arrangement that gave financial interests greater influence at both the national and European levels of government.That combination of stridency and straddle hasn't played well in electoral terms, and has opened space for two other parties to establish themselves as alternatives: the Liberal Democrats, a longstanding centrist liberal party that has positioned itself as the unequivocal party of Remain, and the Brexit Party, a newly-minted political faction founded by Nigel Farage, the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party. At one point this past summer, both parties looked capable of surpassing the Tories, and possibly Labour as well.Since Boris Johnson took the premiership, though, the picture has changed dramatically. The Brexit party has fallen back to 10-12 percent in the polls, while the Tories have surged to the mid-to-high 30s. Moreover, Farage has intimated that he might cooperate with the Tories strategically, targeting constituencies where left-wing Leave voters are concentrated to pull them away from Labour, while staying away from seats that would be contested between the Remain-oriented Liberal Democrats and the Leave-oriented Tories.How could such a strategy work if Brexit is only getting less-popular with time? The answer comes down to intensity and cohesion.If Tory Remain voters -- of which there were many -- cared more about stopping Brexit than they did about the fate of their party, they would defect to the Liberal Democrats, badly damaging the Tories' chances of winning a majority. Similarly, if Labour Remain voters felt that Brexit was the most important issue, they would either have pushed Corbyn to a more decisive Remain stance, or would be working strategically with the Liberal Democrats in the way that the Brexit Party may work with the Tories. And the Liberal Democrats would be doing the same.But while Brexit may be a politically-defining event for the liberal center, for the left this is their first chance at power since the 1970s -- not something to be traded away lightly for the sake of free trade with Germany or even stability in Ireland. Even for liberal centrists, the choice between Corbyn and Johnson may be a tough one. For the right, meanwhile, the party as a whole seems to have come to realize that while the hard Leave voters are a minority in the country, they hold the balance of power within the Tory coalition. If they are not given the wheel, the coach isn't going anywhere.Now they have the wheel, and a Leave coalition looks likely to triumph decisively, in spite of all regrets.What happens then? The opposition could continue to come up with explanations for why the result doesn't truly reflect the will of the people -- blaming the electoral system, for instance (though in current polling the Tory-plus-Brexit coalition outpolls Labour-plus-Lib-Dems by an average of five points, suggesting even proportional representation would give victory to the Brexiteers). But they would be wiser to focus on the future. No longer dependent on the votes of Irish Unionists, nor needing to cater to the concerns of the Scottish Nationalists, a big Tory majority could govern from the center of England rather than Britain.The biggest post-Brexit challenge may not be how to get Britain back into Europe, but how to hold Britain itself together.Want more essential commentary and analysis like this delivered straight to your inbox?

Chris Christie Is Among Lawyers Reaping $15 Million in 1MDB Deal,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:33:49 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/chris-christie-among-lawyers-reaping-133349408.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest recovery ever from an American anti-corruption crackdown is proving lucrative for former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.A major deal struck by the U.S. for fugitive financier Jho Low to give up almost $1 billion in assets allegedly stolen from a Malaysian investment fund comes with a provision to pay his lawyers. As part of the 1MDB settlement, the Justice Department allowed for $15 million to be paid to a group advising Jho Low, including the law firm Christie set up after two terms as New Jersey’s governor.Those proceeds will come from Jho Low’s stake in EMI Music Publishing, which has grown to about $415 million. That investment ballooned after he initially put in a little more than $100 million stolen from 1MDB, according to prosecutors. The two sides agreed to the provision to allow the lawyers to extract fees from Low, whose assets and accounts have been seized or monitored by authorities across the world.“We were pleased to help negotiate this historic resolution in order to preserve the tremendous value of assets involved,” Christie said in a statement after the Justice Department announced the settlement agreement on Wednesday. It still needs approval from a federal judge.Christie, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 before dropping out and endorsing Donald Trump, set up his own law firm last year, the Christie Law Firm LLC. The other firms that will receive proceeds of the 1MDB deal for legal expenses are Kobre & Kim LLP and Lowenstein Sandler LLP.The agreement comes even before the criminal charges against Low have been resolved. In the settlement, the Justice Department cautioned that the released funds should be used only for the Low family’s legal fees and costs related to the lawsuits, and can’t be routed back to Low or his family.To contact the reporter on this story: Sridhar Natarajan in New York at snatarajan15@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

India Farmers Plan Nationwide Protest Against 16-Nation Trade Deal,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 08:50:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/india-farmers-plan-nationwide-protest-125007797.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. India’s farmers’ organizations have planned a nationwide protest on Nov. 4 to demand that the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi keep agriculture out of a 16-nation trade agreement currently being negotiated in Thailand.The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, an umbrella organization of about 250 farmers unions from across the country, said that they will burn effigies depicting the China-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership or RCEP, to mark their protest and warn the government.Indian farmers won’t be able to compete should the country agree to cut duties for agricultural and dairy products in the proposed trade pact, said V.M. Singh, a convener of the the farmers’ group. Imports of dairy and agricultural products including wheat, cotton and oil seeds would affect the livelihood of millions of Indian farmers, he said.The government should defer signing of the agreement and hold consultations with farmers, state governments and other stake holders before taking a final decision, said Singh. “We have to stop RCEP,” he said.It is not clear yet what terms India will agree to in order to join what could become the world’s largest trade deal. The final stage of negotiations have begun in Bangkok and Indian trade minister Piyush Goyal will travel for the ministerial meeting there on Nov. 1. The nations are seeking to conclude the negotiations by November end.To contact the reporter on this story: Bibhudatta Pradhan in New Delhi at bpradhan@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ruth Pollard at rpollard2@bloomberg.net, Muneeza Naqvi, Abhay SinghFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GF2o4tZmPCtqpE8IuBOemg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/38b9b9b23d04b76ac5ea78347d209b84,India Farmers Plan Nationwide Protest Against 16-Nation Trade Deal

Authorities Identify ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe’ Through DNA and Now the Real Questions Start,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:13:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/authorities-identify-fly-creek-jane-131307745.html,"On a chilly February Sunday in 1980, a father and son panning for gold along Fly Creek in Clark County, Washington, kicked up the remains of a human skeleton that appeared to have been buried in a shallow grave. They called the authorities who came to collect the skull and what bones hadn’t been dragged away by animals, and were able to use the remains to construct a facial reconstruction that produced a picture of a teenage girl. Detectives were able to deduce that she died from a cause that did not seem natural. Calls for information, searches through missing persons reports, and detective work turned up nothing. No one seemed to miss the teen, dubbed the ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe,’ and, for the last 40 years, that is as far as the case went–until now.This summer Clark County detectives decided to post a DNA sample from the old remains to the Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, a public genealogy database that has had recent success closing old cold cases. The lab found a tie to a distant cousin of a teen named Sandra “Sandy” Renee Morden who said she was last seen in 1977–three years before her skeletal remains were found. Courtesy of Clark County SheriffThe Oregonian then dug up an old birthday announcement that was tied to the case. On April 29, 1977, in the classified section of the paper, a tiny ad appeared that said: “Sandra Renee Morden, Happy 15th Birthday. Love Always—Mom.” Such published greetings were a common way to mark a birthday or anniversary in the era before Facebook and other social media. Morden’s parents were divorced, according to the DNA-linked cousin, who does not want to be named and who provided Clark County cold-case detective Lindsay Schultz with the only clues the teen’s life. Schultz told the Oregonian that Morden was a “latchkey kid” who was mostly “unsupervised.” There is no indication that the parents filed a missing persons report, and, as Schultz says, “We didn’t have [the National Crime Information Center] at that time.” The detective says Morden’s parents came from the San Francisco area and settled in Portland. They split up in the early 1970s, and did not communicate with each other. The girl’s mother, identified as Kathryn Irene Morden, apparently lost custody and the cousin said Sandy most often stayed with her father, identified as Andrew Bain Morden, a Marine Corps veteran who fought in the Korean War. Schultz says she likely fell through the cracks when one parent thought the other had her. She last attended Wilson High School in Portland. Schultz told the Oregonian that the father likely thought she was with her mother. He had left her alone for an extended period of time and when he came back, she was gone, so he assumed she had gone to her mother’s home. “We don’t know for certain,” Schultz says. “We know that’s what family members believe.”Both parents are dead, so there is no way to confirm what either of them knew. Schultz told the Oregonian that it is the birthday greeting that bothers him most. It was posted around the time the extended family says she disappeared. “Was it just a mom who loved her daughter–or did her mom know something and put it out there for that reason?” Schultz said. “It’s one of those two, right? You ponder it. You look at it and you think, ‘What does it mean?’”Now detectives are looking for the missing puzzle pieces. They are calling on anyone who might have any information about Morden, her parents, or how she might have died to contact the Clark County Medical Examiner's Office or Clark County Sheriff's Office Cold Case Tip Line.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

A Nobel Peace Prize for Vladimir Putin? That’s the Talk in Moscow.,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 05:40:49 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/nobel-peace-prize-vladimir-putin-094049080.html,"Adam Berry/GettyMOSCOW—For those who live outside Russia and the enormous bubble of admiration inflated around President Vladimir Putin, this story may be a bit hard to believe. But there is a movement afoot here, apparently in all sincerity, to nominate Putin for the Nobel Peace Prize.From the outside, one must wonder how the dossier for the former KGB operative might be prepared. Would it include the peace of the grave imposed on civilians in the Second Chechen War early in Putin’s presidency? Or would it be for backing quasi states broken away from the Republic of Georgia? Or, more recently, for the forcible annexation of Crimea and the instigation of a separatist war in Ukraine that continues to this day? Alex Gibney: How Donald Trump Is Morphing Into Vladimir PutinOr perhaps he’d win for Syria, where Putin is a strong supporter of the Assad dictatorship that has killed hundreds of thousands of people while half of the nation’s population has been driven into internal or external exile. Would that be the venue for Putin the peacemaker to earn his Nobel laurels?In fact, through the looking glass of Moscow’s media and Putin’s supporters, Ukraine and Syria are held up as prime examples of his eligibility for The Prize.The general secretary of the Russian-Turkish Public Forum, Sergey Markov, who is close to the Kremlin, tells The Daily Beast that there is no better candidate for the prestigious award than Putin: “Most Russian state officials believe that President Putin deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for saving the world from a nuclear war during the crisis in Ukraine in 2014—for holding back and not bringing Russian forces to Kharkiv, Dnepropetrovsk, [Ukrainian] cities full of Russian people,” Markov said, adding, “Of course Putin should be given the prize for solving the Turkish-Kurdish conflict, which risked taking thousands of lives.” Forget U.S. President Donald Trump’s efforts to claim credit for a ceasefire deal with Ankara, Putin’s supporters in Moscow believe that it was Putin alone who managed to find the solution and negotiate a deal with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that prevented a Turkish-Kurdish bloodbath. Whoever is responsible, the arrangement is essentially on Erdogan’s terms, opening the way for ethnic cleansing as Kurdish troops withdraw, Kurdish civilians flee, and Erdogan plans to move millions of Syrian Arabs, most of them from other parts of the country, into what Erdogan calls a “safe zone.”Yet Aleksey Venediktov, editor-in-chief of the influential independent radio station Echo of Moscow, tweeted last week as that deal came down: “They tell me at the top: ‘Now you understand, Putin deserves a Nobel Peace Prize.’” He said his high-level sources were telling him Putin’s Syria deal was like “the new Camp David Accord,” putting it on a par with the 1978 agreement brokered by President Jimmy Carter that ended generations of war between Israel and Egypt. In truth, the Russian leader has been looking to win The Prize for years. Ever since Time magazine put Putin on the cover as Person of the Year in 2007, the Kremlin’s ideologues have believed that the West recognizes Putin as the world’s preeminent politician—and peacemaker—and no wars in Georgia, Ukraine or Syria could dissuade them.Putin’s greatest accomplishment on that score probably came in 2013 when President Barack Obama was weighing the possibility of major military strikes on the Bashar al-Assad regime to retaliate for its use of chemical weapons, and Putin stepped in with a better—or at least more peaceful—plan. He persuaded Assad, first, to admit he had a chemical arsenal, which he had never done before. Then Assad agreed to U.N. inspections as he eliminated everything he admitted to having, and by all accounts the vast majority of those gruesome weapons were destroyed. At the time, that seemed like a major war averted, and therefore a pathway to peace.So at the beginning of 2014 a Russian advocacy group called the International Academy of Spiritual Unity and Cooperation of People put Putin up for the prize.Unfortunately for Putin’s aspirations, there’s quite a long delay between the nominations at the beginning of the year, and the awards at the end, and Putin was not exactly making peace in 2014. Reacting to a popular pro-European, largely anti-Russian uprising in Ukraine, he seized the Crimean Peninsula, annexed it to Russia, and poured support into separatist rebels in Eastern Ukraine. The death toll soon climbed into the thousands, with hundreds of thousands of people displaced. In July 2014 a Russian-supplied missile shot down a Malaysian Airliner en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur with 298 people on board, all of whom died.If anyone argued in 2014, as Markov suggests, that Putin should have gotten a peace prize for not staging a massive, direct invasion of Ukraine to take the large cities of Kharkiv and Dnepropetrovsk, the Nobel Committee in Norway clearly was not persuaded. It gave the 2014 prize to Kailash Satyarthi and Malala Yousafzai ""for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education.""Russia’s record in Syria has been equally bloody since it entered the fight directly to support Assad in 2015.  One recent example was a Russian-Syrian military strike on a center for hundreds of displaced people in the town of Haas in Idlib that killed 20 civilians in August. A Human Rights Watch investigation published in October qualified the attack as “an apparent war crime.” Sara Kayyali who monitors the violations on the ground for HRW, tells The Daily Beast that “Russian strikes on protected humanitarian infrastructure” have been common in the areas where they operate, with “severely negative consequences.”Now, says Kayyali, “Russia has brokered an agreement with Turkey around a so-called ‘safe zone,’ but as history has proved again and again, safe zones are rarely safe.” President Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov gloated last week, saying, ""The United States was the closest ally of the Kurds during the last few years, and in the end the U.S. ditched the Kurds and effectively betrayed them."" By arranging for the withdrawal of the fighters, Peskov suggested, Russia is at least saving their lives. The United States looks foolish and treacherous, to be sure. But some analysts suggest Russia’s schadenfreude is premature. David Aaron Miller at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace notes that among some in Washington, “Animosity toward Trump and Putin—richly deserved—is clouding the analysis on Syria  and triggering overreaction about Russia’s gains.”As Miller points out, “Russia has been the dominant external power in Syria since at least the 1970s. And the U.S. withdrawal has no doubt consolidated that and elevated Russia’s role in the region. But we shouldn’t overestimate Moscow’s gains.  They now preside over a broken country that will take years and billions to heal. They are shackled with a pariah regime—both entitled and dependent—that will continue to alienate the majority of the Sunni population; they face a resurgent ISIS and are now shackled with responsibility for managing both the Turkish-Syrian-Kurdish triangle and a potential Israeli-Iranian conflict.”“The idea of giving Putin a Nobel Peace Prize sounds ridiculous after years of this dirty war in Syria, the Russian military violating international law, using banned weapons, bombing hospitals and clinics,” Tania Lokshina, Europe and Central Asia associate director at Human Rights Watch Moscow, told The Daily Beast. But still the dream lives on, revived by the agreement moving the Kurds out of the region near the Turkish border. Last week the Russian news agency riafan.ru headlined: “Foreigners propose to award Putin with a Nobel Prize for peace in Syria.” The deadline for Nobel nominations is January 31. One can only guess at the peace initiatives Putin will carry out between now and then.Is Trump Saving Those Syrian Oil Fields for the Russians?Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Chris Christie Among Lawyers Making $15 Million in 1MDB Pact,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 12:10:31 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/chris-christie-among-lawyers-reaping-133349408.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest recovery ever from an American anti-corruption crackdown is proving lucrative for former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.A major deal struck by the U.S. for fugitive financier Jho Low to give up almost $1 billion in assets allegedly stolen from a Malaysian investment fund comes with a provision to pay his lawyers. As part of the 1MDB settlement, the Justice Department allowed for $15 million to be paid to a group advising Jho Low, including the law firm Christie set up after two terms as New Jersey’s governor.Those proceeds will come from Jho Low’s stake in EMI Music Publishing, which has grown to about $415 million. That investment ballooned after he initially put in a little more than $100 million stolen from 1MDB, according to prosecutors. The two sides agreed to the provision to allow the lawyers to extract fees from Low, whose assets and accounts have been seized or monitored by authorities across the world.“We were pleased to help negotiate this historic resolution in order to preserve the tremendous value of assets involved,” Christie said in a statement after the Justice Department announced the settlement agreement on Wednesday. It still needs approval from a federal judge.Christie, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 before dropping out and endorsing Donald Trump, set up his own law firm last year, the Christie Law Firm LLC. The other firms that will receive proceeds of the 1MDB deal for legal expenses are Kobre & Kim LLP and Lowenstein Sandler LLP.The agreement comes even before the criminal charges against Low have been resolved. In the settlement, the Justice Department cautioned that the released funds should be used only for the Low family’s legal fees and costs related to the lawsuits, and can’t be routed back to Low or his family.The cases were resolved in a “collaborative and fair way that includes payment of our legal fees,” said Robin Rathmell, a lawyer at Kobre & Kim.(Updates with lawyer’s comment in last paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Sridhar Natarajan in New York at snatarajan15@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

Courtesy of Clark County SheriffThe Oregonian then dug up an old birthday announcement that was tied to the case. On April 29, 1977, in the classified section of the paper, a tiny ad appeared that said: “Sandra Renee Morden, Happy 15th Birthday. Love Always—Mom.” Such published greetings were a common way to mark a birthday or anniversary in the era before Facebook and other social media. Morden’s parents were divorced, according to the DNA-linked cousin, who does not want to be named and who provided Clark County cold-case detective Lindsay Schultz with the only clues the teen’s life. Schultz told the Oregonian that Morden was a “latchkey kid” who was mostly “unsupervised.” There is no indication that the parents filed a missing persons report, and, as Schultz says, “We didn’t have [the National Crime Information Center] at that time.” The detective says Morden’s parents came from the San Francisco area and settled in Portland. They split up in the early 1970s, and did not communicate with each other. The girl’s mother, identified as Kathryn Irene Morden, apparently lost custody and the cousin said Sandy most often stayed with her father, identified as Andrew Bain Morden, a Marine Corps veteran who fought in the Korean War. Schultz says she likely fell through the cracks when one parent thought the other had her. She last attended Wilson High School in Portland. Schultz told the Oregonian that the father likely thought she was with her mother. He had left her alone for an extended period of time and when he came back, she was gone, so he assumed she had gone to her mother’s home. “We don’t know for certain,” Schultz says. “We know that’s what family members believe.”Both parents are dead, so there is no way to confirm what either of them knew. Schultz told the Oregonian that it is the birthday greeting that bothers him most. It was posted around the time the extended family says she disappeared. “Was it just a mom who loved her daughter–or did her mom know something and put it out there for that reason?” Schultz said. “It’s one of those two, right? You ponder it. You look at it and you think, ‘What does it mean?’”Now detectives are looking for the missing puzzle pieces. They are calling on anyone who might have any information about Morden, her parents, or how she might have died to contact the Clark County Medical Examiner's Office or Clark County Sheriff's Office Cold Case Tip Line.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

"KGB Judged ‘Comrade V.V. Putin’ a Disciplined, Conscientious Spy","Thu, 31 Oct 2019 06:46:29 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/kgb-judged-comrade-v-v-104629972.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin was “prompt, disciplined and conscientious” as a spy in the KGB, according to a declassified profile from the Soviet Union’s feared security service.“Comrade V.V. Putin constantly improves his ideological and political standards,” according to the document exhibited at the Central State Archive for Historical-Political Documents of St. Petersburg, the Russian leader’s home city. “He’s actively engaged in party education work.”The profile, which is also on show at a Moscow exhibition of “outstanding figures” of modern Russian history, describes Putin as “morally upstanding” and enjoying “well-deserved authority among colleagues,” noting that he won a judo championship in 1978.Putin joined the KGB in 1975 after graduating from the law faculty of Leningrad State University, located in what’s now St. Petersburg, and served as a spy for more than 15 years until the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991. Putin asked to become a KGB officer even before he finished school, according to his Kremlin biography, which cites him saying his view of the organization “was based on idealistic stories I heard about intelligence.”He served in Dresden in East Germany from 1985 until 1990, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel during a largely undistinguished stint, and was awarded a bronze medal for service to the National People’s Army of the German Democratic Republic. He headed the Federal Security Service, the main successor agency of the KGB, in 1998-1999 before President Boris Yeltsin made him prime minister and named Putin as his chosen successor. Putin was elected president in 2000.The KGB’s appraisal of Putin, which appears to be from the late 1970s or early 1980s, was absolutely standard and showed that he hadn’t stood out or achieved anything in particular, according to Alexei Kondaurov, a former KGB general. “Usually we wrote ‘morally upstanding’ when there was nothing else to say,” he said.Still, there’s been “colossal” public interest in the document, shown as part of commemorations of the archive’s 90th anniversary, said Olga Bobrova, deputy head of the institution.To contact the reporters on this story: Irina Reznik in Moscow at ireznik@bloomberg.net;Henry Meyer in Moscow at hmeyer4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Gregory L.

Why the Tories are cruising toward a big win in Britain,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 05:50:02 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/why-tories-cruising-toward-big-095002680.html,"The polling is clear. Over the more than three years since they voted to leave the European Union, British voters have come to regret their choice. Polls consistently show a several-point margin in favor of Remain, only one in three voters will endorse the proposition that getting Brexit over with is better than further delay, and two thirds believe that a no-deal Brexit should require another referendum.So why are Boris Johnson's Tories, running on a clearer stance for Brexit than ever before, currently projected to win a decisive victory in the December election?The simplest answer is: the opposition is divided. But that answer obscures more than it reveals, because it presumes that the question of Brexit is as dominant among the opposition as it is among the Tories. And the division of the opposition itself proves that this is not the case. On the contrary: Brexit is a truly existential question for a far larger fraction of Leave voters than it is of Remain voters, and that has had and continues to have material electoral consequences.Consider the largest opposition party. Labour under Jeremy Corbin has trended in an overwhelmingly left-wing direction, not only on economic matters but also on immigration and foreign policy. A ""no enemies on the left"" approach has even seen extremist illiberal and anti-Semitic elements gain a greater foothold within the party. But on Brexit, Corbyn has taken a somewhat ambiguous stance, reflecting the fact that while a majority of Labourites voted Remain, a not insignificant number had always been skeptical of an economic arrangement that gave financial interests greater influence at both the national and European levels of government.That combination of stridency and straddle hasn't played well in electoral terms, and has opened space for two other parties to establish themselves as alternatives: the Liberal Democrats, a longstanding centrist liberal party that has positioned itself as the unequivocal party of Remain, and the Brexit Party, a newly-minted political faction founded by Nigel Farage, the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party. At one point this past summer, both parties looked capable of surpassing the Tories, and possibly Labour as well.Since Boris Johnson took the premiership, though, the picture has changed dramatically. The Brexit party has fallen back to 10-12 percent in the polls, while the Tories have surged to the mid-to-high 30s. Moreover, Farage has intimated that he might cooperate with the Tories strategically, targeting constituencies where left-wing Leave voters are concentrated to pull them away from Labour, while staying away from seats that would be contested between the Remain-oriented Liberal Democrats and the Leave-oriented Tories.How could such a strategy work if Brexit is only getting less-popular with time? The answer comes down to intensity and cohesion.If Tory Remain voters -- of which there were many -- cared more about stopping Brexit than they did about the fate of their party, they would defect to the Liberal Democrats, badly damaging the Tories' chances of winning a majority. Similarly, if Labour Remain voters felt that Brexit was the most important issue, they would either have pushed Corbyn to a more decisive Remain stance, or would be working strategically with the Liberal Democrats in the way that the Brexit Party may work with the Tories. And the Liberal Democrats would be doing the same.But while Brexit may be a politically-defining event for the liberal center, for the left this is their first chance at power since the 1970s -- not something to be traded away lightly for the sake of free trade with Germany or even stability in Ireland. Even for liberal centrists, the choice between Corbyn and Johnson may be a tough one. For the right, meanwhile, the party as a whole seems to have come to realize that while the hard Leave voters are a minority in the country, they hold the balance of power within the Tory coalition. If they are not given the wheel, the coach isn't going anywhere.Now they have the wheel, and a Leave coalition looks likely to triumph decisively, in spite of all regrets.What happens then? The opposition could continue to come up with explanations for why the result doesn't truly reflect the will of the people -- blaming the electoral system, for instance (though in current polling the Tory-plus-Brexit coalition outpolls Labour-plus-Lib-Dems by an average of five points, suggesting even proportional representation would give victory to the Brexiteers). But they would be wiser to focus on the future. No longer dependent on the votes of Irish Unionists, nor needing to cater to the concerns of the Scottish Nationalists, a big Tory majority could govern from the center of England rather than Britain.The biggest post-Brexit challenge may not be how to get Britain back into Europe, but how to hold Britain itself together.Want more essential commentary and analysis like this delivered straight to your inbox?

Chris Christie Is Among Lawyers Reaping $15 Million in 1MDB Deal,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:33:49 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/chris-christie-among-lawyers-reaping-133349408.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest recovery ever from an American anti-corruption crackdown is proving lucrative for former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.A major deal struck by the U.S. for fugitive financier Jho Low to give up almost $1 billion in assets allegedly stolen from a Malaysian investment fund comes with a provision to pay his lawyers. As part of the 1MDB settlement, the Justice Department allowed for $15 million to be paid to a group advising Jho Low, including the law firm Christie set up after two terms as New Jersey’s governor.Those proceeds will come from Jho Low’s stake in EMI Music Publishing, which has grown to about $415 million. That investment ballooned after he initially put in a little more than $100 million stolen from 1MDB, according to prosecutors. The two sides agreed to the provision to allow the lawyers to extract fees from Low, whose assets and accounts have been seized or monitored by authorities across the world.“We were pleased to help negotiate this historic resolution in order to preserve the tremendous value of assets involved,” Christie said in a statement after the Justice Department announced the settlement agreement on Wednesday. It still needs approval from a federal judge.Christie, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 before dropping out and endorsing Donald Trump, set up his own law firm last year, the Christie Law Firm LLC. The other firms that will receive proceeds of the 1MDB deal for legal expenses are Kobre & Kim LLP and Lowenstein Sandler LLP.The agreement comes even before the criminal charges against Low have been resolved. In the settlement, the Justice Department cautioned that the released funds should be used only for the Low family’s legal fees and costs related to the lawsuits, and can’t be routed back to Low or his family.To contact the reporter on this story: Sridhar Natarajan in New York at snatarajan15@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

Authorities Identify ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe’ Through DNA and Now the Real Questions Start,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:13:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/authorities-identify-fly-creek-jane-131307745.html,"On a chilly February Sunday in 1980, a father and son panning for gold along Fly Creek in Clark County, Washington, kicked up the remains of a human skeleton that appeared to have been buried in a shallow grave. They called the authorities who came to collect the skull and what bones hadn’t been dragged away by animals, and were able to use the remains to construct a facial reconstruction that produced a picture of a teenage girl. Detectives were able to deduce that she died from a cause that did not seem natural. Calls for information, searches through missing persons reports, and detective work turned up nothing. No one seemed to miss the teen, dubbed the ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe,’ and, for the last 40 years, that is as far as the case went–until now.This summer Clark County detectives decided to post a DNA sample from the old remains to the Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, a public genealogy database that has had recent success closing old cold cases. The lab found a tie to a distant cousin of a teen named Sandra “Sandy” Renee Morden who said she was last seen in 1977–three years before her skeletal remains were found. Courtesy of Clark County SheriffThe Oregonian then dug up an old birthday announcement that was tied to the case. On April 29, 1977, in the classified section of the paper, a tiny ad appeared that said: “Sandra Renee Morden, Happy 15th Birthday. Love Always—Mom.” Such published greetings were a common way to mark a birthday or anniversary in the era before Facebook and other social media. Morden’s parents were divorced, according to the DNA-linked cousin, who does not want to be named and who provided Clark County cold-case detective Lindsay Schultz with the only clues the teen’s life. Schultz told the Oregonian that Morden was a “latchkey kid” who was mostly “unsupervised.” There is no indication that the parents filed a missing persons report, and, as Schultz says, “We didn’t have [the National Crime Information Center] at that time.” The detective says Morden’s parents came from the San Francisco area and settled in Portland. They split up in the early 1970s, and did not communicate with each other. The girl’s mother, identified as Kathryn Irene Morden, apparently lost custody and the cousin said Sandy most often stayed with her father, identified as Andrew Bain Morden, a Marine Corps veteran who fought in the Korean War. Schultz says she likely fell through the cracks when one parent thought the other had her. She last attended Wilson High School in Portland. Schultz told the Oregonian that the father likely thought she was with her mother. He had left her alone for an extended period of time and when he came back, she was gone, so he assumed she had gone to her mother’s home. “We don’t know for certain,” Schultz says. “We know that’s what family members believe.”Both parents are dead, so there is no way to confirm what either of them knew. Schultz told the Oregonian that it is the birthday greeting that bothers him most. It was posted around the time the extended family says she disappeared. “Was it just a mom who loved her daughter–or did her mom know something and put it out there for that reason?” Schultz said. “It’s one of those two, right? You ponder it. You look at it and you think, ‘What does it mean?’”Now detectives are looking for the missing puzzle pieces.

A Nobel Peace Prize for Vladimir Putin? That’s the Talk in Moscow.,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 05:40:49 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/nobel-peace-prize-vladimir-putin-094049080.html,"Adam Berry/GettyMOSCOW—For those who live outside Russia and the enormous bubble of admiration inflated around President Vladimir Putin, this story may be a bit hard to believe. But there is a movement afoot here, apparently in all sincerity, to nominate Putin for the Nobel Peace Prize.From the outside, one must wonder how the dossier for the former KGB operative might be prepared. Would it include the peace of the grave imposed on civilians in the Second Chechen War early in Putin’s presidency? Or would it be for backing quasi states broken away from the Republic of Georgia? Or, more recently, for the forcible annexation of Crimea and the instigation of a separatist war in Ukraine that continues to this day? Alex Gibney: How Donald Trump Is Morphing Into Vladimir PutinOr perhaps he’d win for Syria, where Putin is a strong supporter of the Assad dictatorship that has killed hundreds of thousands of people while half of the nation’s population has been driven into internal or external exile. Would that be the venue for Putin the peacemaker to earn his Nobel laurels?In fact, through the looking glass of Moscow’s media and Putin’s supporters, Ukraine and Syria are held up as prime examples of his eligibility for The Prize.The general secretary of the Russian-Turkish Public Forum, Sergey Markov, who is close to the Kremlin, tells The Daily Beast that there is no better candidate for the prestigious award than Putin: “Most Russian state officials believe that President Putin deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for saving the world from a nuclear war during the crisis in Ukraine in 2014—for holding back and not bringing Russian forces to Kharkiv, Dnepropetrovsk, [Ukrainian] cities full of Russian people,” Markov said, adding, “Of course Putin should be given the prize for solving the Turkish-Kurdish conflict, which risked taking thousands of lives.” Forget U.S. President Donald Trump’s efforts to claim credit for a ceasefire deal with Ankara, Putin’s supporters in Moscow believe that it was Putin alone who managed to find the solution and negotiate a deal with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that prevented a Turkish-Kurdish bloodbath. Whoever is responsible, the arrangement is essentially on Erdogan’s terms, opening the way for ethnic cleansing as Kurdish troops withdraw, Kurdish civilians flee, and Erdogan plans to move millions of Syrian Arabs, most of them from other parts of the country, into what Erdogan calls a “safe zone.”Yet Aleksey Venediktov, editor-in-chief of the influential independent radio station Echo of Moscow, tweeted last week as that deal came down: “They tell me at the top: ‘Now you understand, Putin deserves a Nobel Peace Prize.’” He said his high-level sources were telling him Putin’s Syria deal was like “the new Camp David Accord,” putting it on a par with the 1978 agreement brokered by President Jimmy Carter that ended generations of war between Israel and Egypt. In truth, the Russian leader has been looking to win The Prize for years. Ever since Time magazine put Putin on the cover as Person of the Year in 2007, the Kremlin’s ideologues have believed that the West recognizes Putin as the world’s preeminent politician—and peacemaker—and no wars in Georgia, Ukraine or Syria could dissuade them.Putin’s greatest accomplishment on that score probably came in 2013 when President Barack Obama was weighing the possibility of major military strikes on the Bashar al-Assad regime to retaliate for its use of chemical weapons, and Putin stepped in with a better—or at least more peaceful—plan. He persuaded Assad, first, to admit he had a chemical arsenal, which he had never done before. Then Assad agreed to U.N. inspections as he eliminated everything he admitted to having, and by all accounts the vast majority of those gruesome weapons were destroyed. At the time, that seemed like a major war averted, and therefore a pathway to peace.So at the beginning of 2014 a Russian advocacy group called the International Academy of Spiritual Unity and Cooperation of People put Putin up for the prize.Unfortunately for Putin’s aspirations, there’s quite a long delay between the nominations at the beginning of the year, and the awards at the end, and Putin was not exactly making peace in 2014. Reacting to a popular pro-European, largely anti-Russian uprising in Ukraine, he seized the Crimean Peninsula, annexed it to Russia, and poured support into separatist rebels in Eastern Ukraine. The death toll soon climbed into the thousands, with hundreds of thousands of people displaced. In July 2014 a Russian-supplied missile shot down a Malaysian Airliner en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur with 298 people on board, all of whom died.If anyone argued in 2014, as Markov suggests, that Putin should have gotten a peace prize for not staging a massive, direct invasion of Ukraine to take the large cities of Kharkiv and Dnepropetrovsk, the Nobel Committee in Norway clearly was not persuaded. It gave the 2014 prize to Kailash Satyarthi and Malala Yousafzai ""for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education.""Russia’s record in Syria has been equally bloody since it entered the fight directly to support Assad in 2015.  One recent example was a Russian-Syrian military strike on a center for hundreds of displaced people in the town of Haas in Idlib that killed 20 civilians in August. A Human Rights Watch investigation published in October qualified the attack as “an apparent war crime.” Sara Kayyali who monitors the violations on the ground for HRW, tells The Daily Beast that “Russian strikes on protected humanitarian infrastructure” have been common in the areas where they operate, with “severely negative consequences.”Now, says Kayyali, “Russia has brokered an agreement with Turkey around a so-called ‘safe zone,’ but as history has proved again and again, safe zones are rarely safe.” President Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov gloated last week, saying, ""The United States was the closest ally of the Kurds during the last few years, and in the end the U.S. ditched the Kurds and effectively betrayed them."" By arranging for the withdrawal of the fighters, Peskov suggested, Russia is at least saving their lives. The United States looks foolish and treacherous, to be sure. But some analysts suggest Russia’s schadenfreude is premature. David Aaron Miller at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace notes that among some in Washington, “Animosity toward Trump and Putin—richly deserved—is clouding the analysis on Syria  and triggering overreaction about Russia’s gains.”As Miller points out, “Russia has been the dominant external power in Syria since at least the 1970s. And the U.S. withdrawal has no doubt consolidated that and elevated Russia’s role in the region. But we shouldn’t overestimate Moscow’s gains.  They now preside over a broken country that will take years and billions to heal. They are shackled with a pariah regime—both entitled and dependent—that will continue to alienate the majority of the Sunni population; they face a resurgent ISIS and are now shackled with responsibility for managing both the Turkish-Syrian-Kurdish triangle and a potential Israeli-Iranian conflict.”“The idea of giving Putin a Nobel Peace Prize sounds ridiculous after years of this dirty war in Syria, the Russian military violating international law, using banned weapons, bombing hospitals and clinics,” Tania Lokshina, Europe and Central Asia associate director at Human Rights Watch Moscow, told The Daily Beast. But still the dream lives on, revived by the agreement moving the Kurds out of the region near the Turkish border. Last week the Russian news agency riafan.ru headlined: “Foreigners propose to award Putin with a Nobel Prize for peace in Syria.” The deadline for Nobel nominations is January 31. One can only guess at the peace initiatives Putin will carry out between now and then.Is Trump Saving Those Syrian Oil Fields for the Russians?Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Why the Tories are cruising toward a big win in Britain,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 05:50:02 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/why-tories-cruising-toward-big-095002680.html,"The polling is clear. Over the more than three years since they voted to leave the European Union, British voters have come to regret their choice. Polls consistently show a several-point margin in favor of Remain, only one in three voters will endorse the proposition that getting Brexit over with is better than further delay, and two thirds believe that a no-deal Brexit should require another referendum.So why are Boris Johnson's Tories, running on a clearer stance for Brexit than ever before, currently projected to win a decisive victory in the December election?The simplest answer is: the opposition is divided. But that answer obscures more than it reveals, because it presumes that the question of Brexit is as dominant among the opposition as it is among the Tories. And the division of the opposition itself proves that this is not the case. On the contrary: Brexit is a truly existential question for a far larger fraction of Leave voters than it is of Remain voters, and that has had and continues to have material electoral consequences.Consider the largest opposition party. Labour under Jeremy Corbin has trended in an overwhelmingly left-wing direction, not only on economic matters but also on immigration and foreign policy. A ""no enemies on the left"" approach has even seen extremist illiberal and anti-Semitic elements gain a greater foothold within the party. But on Brexit, Corbyn has taken a somewhat ambiguous stance, reflecting the fact that while a majority of Labourites voted Remain, a not insignificant number had always been skeptical of an economic arrangement that gave financial interests greater influence at both the national and European levels of government.That combination of stridency and straddle hasn't played well in electoral terms, and has opened space for two other parties to establish themselves as alternatives: the Liberal Democrats, a longstanding centrist liberal party that has positioned itself as the unequivocal party of Remain, and the Brexit Party, a newly-minted political faction founded by Nigel Farage, the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party. At one point this past summer, both parties looked capable of surpassing the Tories, and possibly Labour as well.Since Boris Johnson took the premiership, though, the picture has changed dramatically. The Brexit party has fallen back to 10-12 percent in the polls, while the Tories have surged to the mid-to-high 30s. Moreover, Farage has intimated that he might cooperate with the Tories strategically, targeting constituencies where left-wing Leave voters are concentrated to pull them away from Labour, while staying away from seats that would be contested between the Remain-oriented Liberal Democrats and the Leave-oriented Tories.How could such a strategy work if Brexit is only getting less-popular with time? The answer comes down to intensity and cohesion.If Tory Remain voters -- of which there were many -- cared more about stopping Brexit than they did about the fate of their party, they would defect to the Liberal Democrats, badly damaging the Tories' chances of winning a majority. Similarly, if Labour Remain voters felt that Brexit was the most important issue, they would either have pushed Corbyn to a more decisive Remain stance, or would be working strategically with the Liberal Democrats in the way that the Brexit Party may work with the Tories. And the Liberal Democrats would be doing the same.But while Brexit may be a politically-defining event for the liberal center, for the left this is their first chance at power since the 1970s -- not something to be traded away lightly for the sake of free trade with Germany or even stability in Ireland. Even for liberal centrists, the choice between Corbyn and Johnson may be a tough one. For the right, meanwhile, the party as a whole seems to have come to realize that while the hard Leave voters are a minority in the country, they hold the balance of power within the Tory coalition. If they are not given the wheel, the coach isn't going anywhere.Now they have the wheel, and a Leave coalition looks likely to triumph decisively, in spite of all regrets.What happens then? The opposition could continue to come up with explanations for why the result doesn't truly reflect the will of the people -- blaming the electoral system, for instance (though in current polling the Tory-plus-Brexit coalition outpolls Labour-plus-Lib-Dems by an average of five points, suggesting even proportional representation would give victory to the Brexiteers). But they would be wiser to focus on the future. No longer dependent on the votes of Irish Unionists, nor needing to cater to the concerns of the Scottish Nationalists, a big Tory majority could govern from the center of England rather than Britain.The biggest post-Brexit challenge may not be how to get Britain back into Europe, but how to hold Britain itself together.Want more essential commentary and analysis like this delivered straight to your inbox?

Chris Christie Is Among Lawyers Reaping $15 Million in 1MDB Deal,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:33:49 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/chris-christie-among-lawyers-reaping-133349408.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest recovery ever from an American anti-corruption crackdown is proving lucrative for former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.A major deal struck by the U.S. for fugitive financier Jho Low to give up almost $1 billion in assets allegedly stolen from a Malaysian investment fund comes with a provision to pay his lawyers. As part of the 1MDB settlement, the Justice Department allowed for $15 million to be paid to a group advising Jho Low, including the law firm Christie set up after two terms as New Jersey’s governor.Those proceeds will come from Jho Low’s stake in EMI Music Publishing, which has grown to about $415 million. That investment ballooned after he initially put in a little more than $100 million stolen from 1MDB, according to prosecutors. The two sides agreed to the provision to allow the lawyers to extract fees from Low, whose assets and accounts have been seized or monitored by authorities across the world.“We were pleased to help negotiate this historic resolution in order to preserve the tremendous value of assets involved,” Christie said in a statement after the Justice Department announced the settlement agreement on Wednesday. It still needs approval from a federal judge.Christie, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 before dropping out and endorsing Donald Trump, set up his own law firm last year, the Christie Law Firm LLC. The other firms that will receive proceeds of the 1MDB deal for legal expenses are Kobre & Kim LLP and Lowenstein Sandler LLP.The agreement comes even before the criminal charges against Low have been resolved. In the settlement, the Justice Department cautioned that the released funds should be used only for the Low family’s legal fees and costs related to the lawsuits, and can’t be routed back to Low or his family.To contact the reporter on this story: Sridhar Natarajan in New York at snatarajan15@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

Singh, a convener of the the farmers’ group. Imports of dairy and agricultural products including wheat, cotton and oil seeds would affect the livelihood of millions of Indian farmers, he said.The government should defer signing of the agreement and hold consultations with farmers, state governments and other stake holders before taking a final decision, said Singh. “We have to stop RCEP,” he said.It is not clear yet what terms India will agree to in order to join what could become the world’s largest trade deal. The final stage of negotiations have begun in Bangkok and Indian trade minister Piyush Goyal will travel for the ministerial meeting there on Nov. 1.

Authorities Identify ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe’ Through DNA and Now the Real Questions Start,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:13:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/authorities-identify-fly-creek-jane-131307745.html,"On a chilly February Sunday in 1980, a father and son panning for gold along Fly Creek in Clark County, Washington, kicked up the remains of a human skeleton that appeared to have been buried in a shallow grave. They called the authorities who came to collect the skull and what bones hadn’t been dragged away by animals, and were able to use the remains to construct a facial reconstruction that produced a picture of a teenage girl. Detectives were able to deduce that she died from a cause that did not seem natural. Calls for information, searches through missing persons reports, and detective work turned up nothing. No one seemed to miss the teen, dubbed the ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe,’ and, for the last 40 years, that is as far as the case went–until now.This summer Clark County detectives decided to post a DNA sample from the old remains to the Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, a public genealogy database that has had recent success closing old cold cases. The lab found a tie to a distant cousin of a teen named Sandra “Sandy” Renee Morden who said she was last seen in 1977–three years before her skeletal remains were found. Courtesy of Clark County SheriffThe Oregonian then dug up an old birthday announcement that was tied to the case. On April 29, 1977, in the classified section of the paper, a tiny ad appeared that said: “Sandra Renee Morden, Happy 15th Birthday. Love Always—Mom.” Such published greetings were a common way to mark a birthday or anniversary in the era before Facebook and other social media. Morden’s parents were divorced, according to the DNA-linked cousin, who does not want to be named and who provided Clark County cold-case detective Lindsay Schultz with the only clues the teen’s life. Schultz told the Oregonian that Morden was a “latchkey kid” who was mostly “unsupervised.” There is no indication that the parents filed a missing persons report, and, as Schultz says, “We didn’t have [the National Crime Information Center] at that time.” The detective says Morden’s parents came from the San Francisco area and settled in Portland. They split up in the early 1970s, and did not communicate with each other. The girl’s mother, identified as Kathryn Irene Morden, apparently lost custody and the cousin said Sandy most often stayed with her father, identified as Andrew Bain Morden, a Marine Corps veteran who fought in the Korean War. Schultz says she likely fell through the cracks when one parent thought the other had her. She last attended Wilson High School in Portland. Schultz told the Oregonian that the father likely thought she was with her mother. He had left her alone for an extended period of time and when he came back, she was gone, so he assumed she had gone to her mother’s home. “We don’t know for certain,” Schultz says. “We know that’s what family members believe.”Both parents are dead, so there is no way to confirm what either of them knew. Schultz told the Oregonian that it is the birthday greeting that bothers him most. It was posted around the time the extended family says she disappeared. “Was it just a mom who loved her daughter–or did her mom know something and put it out there for that reason?” Schultz said. “It’s one of those two, right? You ponder it. You look at it and you think, ‘What does it mean?’”Now detectives are looking for the missing puzzle pieces. They are calling on anyone who might have any information about Morden, her parents, or how she might have died to contact the Clark County Medical Examiner's Office or Clark County Sheriff's Office Cold Case Tip Line.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

A Nobel Peace Prize for Vladimir Putin? That’s the Talk in Moscow.,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 05:40:49 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/nobel-peace-prize-vladimir-putin-094049080.html,"Adam Berry/GettyMOSCOW—For those who live outside Russia and the enormous bubble of admiration inflated around President Vladimir Putin, this story may be a bit hard to believe. But there is a movement afoot here, apparently in all sincerity, to nominate Putin for the Nobel Peace Prize.From the outside, one must wonder how the dossier for the former KGB operative might be prepared. Would it include the peace of the grave imposed on civilians in the Second Chechen War early in Putin’s presidency? Or would it be for backing quasi states broken away from the Republic of Georgia? Or, more recently, for the forcible annexation of Crimea and the instigation of a separatist war in Ukraine that continues to this day? Alex Gibney: How Donald Trump Is Morphing Into Vladimir PutinOr perhaps he’d win for Syria, where Putin is a strong supporter of the Assad dictatorship that has killed hundreds of thousands of people while half of the nation’s population has been driven into internal or external exile. Would that be the venue for Putin the peacemaker to earn his Nobel laurels?In fact, through the looking glass of Moscow’s media and Putin’s supporters, Ukraine and Syria are held up as prime examples of his eligibility for The Prize.The general secretary of the Russian-Turkish Public Forum, Sergey Markov, who is close to the Kremlin, tells The Daily Beast that there is no better candidate for the prestigious award than Putin: “Most Russian state officials believe that President Putin deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for saving the world from a nuclear war during the crisis in Ukraine in 2014—for holding back and not bringing Russian forces to Kharkiv, Dnepropetrovsk, [Ukrainian] cities full of Russian people,” Markov said, adding, “Of course Putin should be given the prize for solving the Turkish-Kurdish conflict, which risked taking thousands of lives.” Forget U.S. President Donald Trump’s efforts to claim credit for a ceasefire deal with Ankara, Putin’s supporters in Moscow believe that it was Putin alone who managed to find the solution and negotiate a deal with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that prevented a Turkish-Kurdish bloodbath. Whoever is responsible, the arrangement is essentially on Erdogan’s terms, opening the way for ethnic cleansing as Kurdish troops withdraw, Kurdish civilians flee, and Erdogan plans to move millions of Syrian Arabs, most of them from other parts of the country, into what Erdogan calls a “safe zone.”Yet Aleksey Venediktov, editor-in-chief of the influential independent radio station Echo of Moscow, tweeted last week as that deal came down: “They tell me at the top: ‘Now you understand, Putin deserves a Nobel Peace Prize.’” He said his high-level sources were telling him Putin’s Syria deal was like “the new Camp David Accord,” putting it on a par with the 1978 agreement brokered by President Jimmy Carter that ended generations of war between Israel and Egypt. In truth, the Russian leader has been looking to win The Prize for years. Ever since Time magazine put Putin on the cover as Person of the Year in 2007, the Kremlin’s ideologues have believed that the West recognizes Putin as the world’s preeminent politician—and peacemaker—and no wars in Georgia, Ukraine or Syria could dissuade them.Putin’s greatest accomplishment on that score probably came in 2013 when President Barack Obama was weighing the possibility of major military strikes on the Bashar al-Assad regime to retaliate for its use of chemical weapons, and Putin stepped in with a better—or at least more peaceful—plan. He persuaded Assad, first, to admit he had a chemical arsenal, which he had never done before. Then Assad agreed to U.N. inspections as he eliminated everything he admitted to having, and by all accounts the vast majority of those gruesome weapons were destroyed. At the time, that seemed like a major war averted, and therefore a pathway to peace.So at the beginning of 2014 a Russian advocacy group called the International Academy of Spiritual Unity and Cooperation of People put Putin up for the prize.Unfortunately for Putin’s aspirations, there’s quite a long delay between the nominations at the beginning of the year, and the awards at the end, and Putin was not exactly making peace in 2014. Reacting to a popular pro-European, largely anti-Russian uprising in Ukraine, he seized the Crimean Peninsula, annexed it to Russia, and poured support into separatist rebels in Eastern Ukraine. The death toll soon climbed into the thousands, with hundreds of thousands of people displaced. In July 2014 a Russian-supplied missile shot down a Malaysian Airliner en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur with 298 people on board, all of whom died.If anyone argued in 2014, as Markov suggests, that Putin should have gotten a peace prize for not staging a massive, direct invasion of Ukraine to take the large cities of Kharkiv and Dnepropetrovsk, the Nobel Committee in Norway clearly was not persuaded. It gave the 2014 prize to Kailash Satyarthi and Malala Yousafzai ""for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education.""Russia’s record in Syria has been equally bloody since it entered the fight directly to support Assad in 2015.  One recent example was a Russian-Syrian military strike on a center for hundreds of displaced people in the town of Haas in Idlib that killed 20 civilians in August. A Human Rights Watch investigation published in October qualified the attack as “an apparent war crime.” Sara Kayyali who monitors the violations on the ground for HRW, tells The Daily Beast that “Russian strikes on protected humanitarian infrastructure” have been common in the areas where they operate, with “severely negative consequences.”Now, says Kayyali, “Russia has brokered an agreement with Turkey around a so-called ‘safe zone,’ but as history has proved again and again, safe zones are rarely safe.” President Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov gloated last week, saying, ""The United States was the closest ally of the Kurds during the last few years, and in the end the U.S. ditched the Kurds and effectively betrayed them."" By arranging for the withdrawal of the fighters, Peskov suggested, Russia is at least saving their lives. The United States looks foolish and treacherous, to be sure. But some analysts suggest Russia’s schadenfreude is premature. David Aaron Miller at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace notes that among some in Washington, “Animosity toward Trump and Putin—richly deserved—is clouding the analysis on Syria  and triggering overreaction about Russia’s gains.”As Miller points out, “Russia has been the dominant external power in Syria since at least the 1970s. And the U.S. withdrawal has no doubt consolidated that and elevated Russia’s role in the region. But we shouldn’t overestimate Moscow’s gains.  They now preside over a broken country that will take years and billions to heal. They are shackled with a pariah regime—both entitled and dependent—that will continue to alienate the majority of the Sunni population; they face a resurgent ISIS and are now shackled with responsibility for managing both the Turkish-Syrian-Kurdish triangle and a potential Israeli-Iranian conflict.”“The idea of giving Putin a Nobel Peace Prize sounds ridiculous after years of this dirty war in Syria, the Russian military violating international law, using banned weapons, bombing hospitals and clinics,” Tania Lokshina, Europe and Central Asia associate director at Human Rights Watch Moscow, told The Daily Beast. But still the dream lives on, revived by the agreement moving the Kurds out of the region near the Turkish border. Last week the Russian news agency riafan.ru headlined: “Foreigners propose to award Putin with a Nobel Prize for peace in Syria.” The deadline for Nobel nominations is January 31.

Chris Christie Among Lawyers Making $15 Million in 1MDB Pact,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 12:10:31 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/chris-christie-among-lawyers-reaping-133349408.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest recovery ever from an American anti-corruption crackdown is proving lucrative for former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.A major deal struck by the U.S. for fugitive financier Jho Low to give up almost $1 billion in assets allegedly stolen from a Malaysian investment fund comes with a provision to pay his lawyers. As part of the 1MDB settlement, the Justice Department allowed for $15 million to be paid to a group advising Jho Low, including the law firm Christie set up after two terms as New Jersey’s governor.Those proceeds will come from Jho Low’s stake in EMI Music Publishing, which has grown to about $415 million. That investment ballooned after he initially put in a little more than $100 million stolen from 1MDB, according to prosecutors. The two sides agreed to the provision to allow the lawyers to extract fees from Low, whose assets and accounts have been seized or monitored by authorities across the world.“We were pleased to help negotiate this historic resolution in order to preserve the tremendous value of assets involved,” Christie said in a statement after the Justice Department announced the settlement agreement on Wednesday. It still needs approval from a federal judge.Christie, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 before dropping out and endorsing Donald Trump, set up his own law firm last year, the Christie Law Firm LLC. The other firms that will receive proceeds of the 1MDB deal for legal expenses are Kobre & Kim LLP and Lowenstein Sandler LLP.The agreement comes even before the criminal charges against Low have been resolved. In the settlement, the Justice Department cautioned that the released funds should be used only for the Low family’s legal fees and costs related to the lawsuits, and can’t be routed back to Low or his family.The cases were resolved in a “collaborative and fair way that includes payment of our legal fees,” said Robin Rathmell, a lawyer at Kobre & Kim.(Updates with lawyer’s comment in last paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Sridhar Natarajan in New York at snatarajan15@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

The lab found a tie to a distant cousin of a teen named Sandra “Sandy” Renee Morden who said she was last seen in 1977–three years before her skeletal remains were found. Courtesy of Clark County SheriffThe Oregonian then dug up an old birthday announcement that was tied to the case. On April 29, 1977, in the classified section of the paper, a tiny ad appeared that said: “Sandra Renee Morden, Happy 15th Birthday. Love Always—Mom.” Such published greetings were a common way to mark a birthday or anniversary in the era before Facebook and other social media. Morden’s parents were divorced, according to the DNA-linked cousin, who does not want to be named and who provided Clark County cold-case detective Lindsay Schultz with the only clues the teen’s life. Schultz told the Oregonian that Morden was a “latchkey kid” who was mostly “unsupervised.” There is no indication that the parents filed a missing persons report, and, as Schultz says, “We didn’t have [the National Crime Information Center] at that time.” The detective says Morden’s parents came from the San Francisco area and settled in Portland. They split up in the early 1970s, and did not communicate with each other.

Chris Christie Among Lawyers Making $15 Million in 1MDB Pact,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 12:10:31 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/chris-christie-among-lawyers-reaping-133349408.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest recovery ever from an American anti-corruption crackdown is proving lucrative for former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.A major deal struck by the U.S. for fugitive financier Jho Low to give up almost $1 billion in assets allegedly stolen from a Malaysian investment fund comes with a provision to pay his lawyers. As part of the 1MDB settlement, the Justice Department allowed for $15 million to be paid to a group advising Jho Low, including the law firm Christie set up after two terms as New Jersey’s governor.Those proceeds will come from Jho Low’s stake in EMI Music Publishing, which has grown to about $415 million. That investment ballooned after he initially put in a little more than $100 million stolen from 1MDB, according to prosecutors. The two sides agreed to the provision to allow the lawyers to extract fees from Low, whose assets and accounts have been seized or monitored by authorities across the world.“We were pleased to help negotiate this historic resolution in order to preserve the tremendous value of assets involved,” Christie said in a statement after the Justice Department announced the settlement agreement on Wednesday. It still needs approval from a federal judge.Christie, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 before dropping out and endorsing Donald Trump, set up his own law firm last year, the Christie Law Firm LLC. The other firms that will receive proceeds of the 1MDB deal for legal expenses are Kobre & Kim LLP and Lowenstein Sandler LLP.The agreement comes even before the criminal charges against Low have been resolved. In the settlement, the Justice Department cautioned that the released funds should be used only for the Low family’s legal fees and costs related to the lawsuits, and can’t be routed back to Low or his family.The cases were resolved in a “collaborative and fair way that includes payment of our legal fees,” said Robin Rathmell, a lawyer at Kobre & Kim.(Updates with lawyer’s comment in last paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Sridhar Natarajan in New York at snatarajan15@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

A Nobel Peace Prize for Vladimir Putin? That’s the Talk in Moscow.,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 05:40:49 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/nobel-peace-prize-vladimir-putin-094049080.html,"Adam Berry/GettyMOSCOW—For those who live outside Russia and the enormous bubble of admiration inflated around President Vladimir Putin, this story may be a bit hard to believe. But there is a movement afoot here, apparently in all sincerity, to nominate Putin for the Nobel Peace Prize.From the outside, one must wonder how the dossier for the former KGB operative might be prepared. Would it include the peace of the grave imposed on civilians in the Second Chechen War early in Putin’s presidency? Or would it be for backing quasi states broken away from the Republic of Georgia? Or, more recently, for the forcible annexation of Crimea and the instigation of a separatist war in Ukraine that continues to this day? Alex Gibney: How Donald Trump Is Morphing Into Vladimir PutinOr perhaps he’d win for Syria, where Putin is a strong supporter of the Assad dictatorship that has killed hundreds of thousands of people while half of the nation’s population has been driven into internal or external exile. Would that be the venue for Putin the peacemaker to earn his Nobel laurels?In fact, through the looking glass of Moscow’s media and Putin’s supporters, Ukraine and Syria are held up as prime examples of his eligibility for The Prize.The general secretary of the Russian-Turkish Public Forum, Sergey Markov, who is close to the Kremlin, tells The Daily Beast that there is no better candidate for the prestigious award than Putin: “Most Russian state officials believe that President Putin deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for saving the world from a nuclear war during the crisis in Ukraine in 2014—for holding back and not bringing Russian forces to Kharkiv, Dnepropetrovsk, [Ukrainian] cities full of Russian people,” Markov said, adding, “Of course Putin should be given the prize for solving the Turkish-Kurdish conflict, which risked taking thousands of lives.” Forget U.S. President Donald Trump’s efforts to claim credit for a ceasefire deal with Ankara, Putin’s supporters in Moscow believe that it was Putin alone who managed to find the solution and negotiate a deal with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that prevented a Turkish-Kurdish bloodbath. Whoever is responsible, the arrangement is essentially on Erdogan’s terms, opening the way for ethnic cleansing as Kurdish troops withdraw, Kurdish civilians flee, and Erdogan plans to move millions of Syrian Arabs, most of them from other parts of the country, into what Erdogan calls a “safe zone.”Yet Aleksey Venediktov, editor-in-chief of the influential independent radio station Echo of Moscow, tweeted last week as that deal came down: “They tell me at the top: ‘Now you understand, Putin deserves a Nobel Peace Prize.’” He said his high-level sources were telling him Putin’s Syria deal was like “the new Camp David Accord,” putting it on a par with the 1978 agreement brokered by President Jimmy Carter that ended generations of war between Israel and Egypt. In truth, the Russian leader has been looking to win The Prize for years. Ever since Time magazine put Putin on the cover as Person of the Year in 2007, the Kremlin’s ideologues have believed that the West recognizes Putin as the world’s preeminent politician—and peacemaker—and no wars in Georgia, Ukraine or Syria could dissuade them.Putin’s greatest accomplishment on that score probably came in 2013 when President Barack Obama was weighing the possibility of major military strikes on the Bashar al-Assad regime to retaliate for its use of chemical weapons, and Putin stepped in with a better—or at least more peaceful—plan. He persuaded Assad, first, to admit he had a chemical arsenal, which he had never done before. Then Assad agreed to U.N. inspections as he eliminated everything he admitted to having, and by all accounts the vast majority of those gruesome weapons were destroyed. At the time, that seemed like a major war averted, and therefore a pathway to peace.So at the beginning of 2014 a Russian advocacy group called the International Academy of Spiritual Unity and Cooperation of People put Putin up for the prize.Unfortunately for Putin’s aspirations, there’s quite a long delay between the nominations at the beginning of the year, and the awards at the end, and Putin was not exactly making peace in 2014. Reacting to a popular pro-European, largely anti-Russian uprising in Ukraine, he seized the Crimean Peninsula, annexed it to Russia, and poured support into separatist rebels in Eastern Ukraine. The death toll soon climbed into the thousands, with hundreds of thousands of people displaced. In July 2014 a Russian-supplied missile shot down a Malaysian Airliner en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur with 298 people on board, all of whom died.If anyone argued in 2014, as Markov suggests, that Putin should have gotten a peace prize for not staging a massive, direct invasion of Ukraine to take the large cities of Kharkiv and Dnepropetrovsk, the Nobel Committee in Norway clearly was not persuaded. It gave the 2014 prize to Kailash Satyarthi and Malala Yousafzai ""for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education.""Russia’s record in Syria has been equally bloody since it entered the fight directly to support Assad in 2015.  One recent example was a Russian-Syrian military strike on a center for hundreds of displaced people in the town of Haas in Idlib that killed 20 civilians in August. A Human Rights Watch investigation published in October qualified the attack as “an apparent war crime.” Sara Kayyali who monitors the violations on the ground for HRW, tells The Daily Beast that “Russian strikes on protected humanitarian infrastructure” have been common in the areas where they operate, with “severely negative consequences.”Now, says Kayyali, “Russia has brokered an agreement with Turkey around a so-called ‘safe zone,’ but as history has proved again and again, safe zones are rarely safe.” President Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov gloated last week, saying, ""The United States was the closest ally of the Kurds during the last few years, and in the end the U.S. ditched the Kurds and effectively betrayed them."" By arranging for the withdrawal of the fighters, Peskov suggested, Russia is at least saving their lives. The United States looks foolish and treacherous, to be sure. But some analysts suggest Russia’s schadenfreude is premature. David Aaron Miller at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace notes that among some in Washington, “Animosity toward Trump and Putin—richly deserved—is clouding the analysis on Syria  and triggering overreaction about Russia’s gains.”As Miller points out, “Russia has been the dominant external power in Syria since at least the 1970s. And the U.S. withdrawal has no doubt consolidated that and elevated Russia’s role in the region. But we shouldn’t overestimate Moscow’s gains.  They now preside over a broken country that will take years and billions to heal. They are shackled with a pariah regime—both entitled and dependent—that will continue to alienate the majority of the Sunni population; they face a resurgent ISIS and are now shackled with responsibility for managing both the Turkish-Syrian-Kurdish triangle and a potential Israeli-Iranian conflict.”“The idea of giving Putin a Nobel Peace Prize sounds ridiculous after years of this dirty war in Syria, the Russian military violating international law, using banned weapons, bombing hospitals and clinics,” Tania Lokshina, Europe and Central Asia associate director at Human Rights Watch Moscow, told The Daily Beast. But still the dream lives on, revived by the agreement moving the Kurds out of the region near the Turkish border. Last week the Russian news agency riafan.ru headlined: “Foreigners propose to award Putin with a Nobel Prize for peace in Syria.” The deadline for Nobel nominations is January 31. One can only guess at the peace initiatives Putin will carry out between now and then.Is Trump Saving Those Syrian Oil Fields for the Russians?Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

A Nobel Peace Prize for Vladimir Putin? That’s the Talk in Moscow.,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 05:40:49 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/nobel-peace-prize-vladimir-putin-094049080.html,"Adam Berry/GettyMOSCOW—For those who live outside Russia and the enormous bubble of admiration inflated around President Vladimir Putin, this story may be a bit hard to believe. But there is a movement afoot here, apparently in all sincerity, to nominate Putin for the Nobel Peace Prize.From the outside, one must wonder how the dossier for the former KGB operative might be prepared. Would it include the peace of the grave imposed on civilians in the Second Chechen War early in Putin’s presidency? Or would it be for backing quasi states broken away from the Republic of Georgia? Or, more recently, for the forcible annexation of Crimea and the instigation of a separatist war in Ukraine that continues to this day? Alex Gibney: How Donald Trump Is Morphing Into Vladimir PutinOr perhaps he’d win for Syria, where Putin is a strong supporter of the Assad dictatorship that has killed hundreds of thousands of people while half of the nation’s population has been driven into internal or external exile. Would that be the venue for Putin the peacemaker to earn his Nobel laurels?In fact, through the looking glass of Moscow’s media and Putin’s supporters, Ukraine and Syria are held up as prime examples of his eligibility for The Prize.The general secretary of the Russian-Turkish Public Forum, Sergey Markov, who is close to the Kremlin, tells The Daily Beast that there is no better candidate for the prestigious award than Putin: “Most Russian state officials believe that President Putin deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for saving the world from a nuclear war during the crisis in Ukraine in 2014—for holding back and not bringing Russian forces to Kharkiv, Dnepropetrovsk, [Ukrainian] cities full of Russian people,” Markov said, adding, “Of course Putin should be given the prize for solving the Turkish-Kurdish conflict, which risked taking thousands of lives.” Forget U.S. President Donald Trump’s efforts to claim credit for a ceasefire deal with Ankara, Putin’s supporters in Moscow believe that it was Putin alone who managed to find the solution and negotiate a deal with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that prevented a Turkish-Kurdish bloodbath. Whoever is responsible, the arrangement is essentially on Erdogan’s terms, opening the way for ethnic cleansing as Kurdish troops withdraw, Kurdish civilians flee, and Erdogan plans to move millions of Syrian Arabs, most of them from other parts of the country, into what Erdogan calls a “safe zone.”Yet Aleksey Venediktov, editor-in-chief of the influential independent radio station Echo of Moscow, tweeted last week as that deal came down: “They tell me at the top: ‘Now you understand, Putin deserves a Nobel Peace Prize.’” He said his high-level sources were telling him Putin’s Syria deal was like “the new Camp David Accord,” putting it on a par with the 1978 agreement brokered by President Jimmy Carter that ended generations of war between Israel and Egypt. In truth, the Russian leader has been looking to win The Prize for years. Ever since Time magazine put Putin on the cover as Person of the Year in 2007, the Kremlin’s ideologues have believed that the West recognizes Putin as the world’s preeminent politician—and peacemaker—and no wars in Georgia, Ukraine or Syria could dissuade them.Putin’s greatest accomplishment on that score probably came in 2013 when President Barack Obama was weighing the possibility of major military strikes on the Bashar al-Assad regime to retaliate for its use of chemical weapons, and Putin stepped in with a better—or at least more peaceful—plan. He persuaded Assad, first, to admit he had a chemical arsenal, which he had never done before. Then Assad agreed to U.N. inspections as he eliminated everything he admitted to having, and by all accounts the vast majority of those gruesome weapons were destroyed. At the time, that seemed like a major war averted, and therefore a pathway to peace.So at the beginning of 2014 a Russian advocacy group called the International Academy of Spiritual Unity and Cooperation of People put Putin up for the prize.Unfortunately for Putin’s aspirations, there’s quite a long delay between the nominations at the beginning of the year, and the awards at the end, and Putin was not exactly making peace in 2014. Reacting to a popular pro-European, largely anti-Russian uprising in Ukraine, he seized the Crimean Peninsula, annexed it to Russia, and poured support into separatist rebels in Eastern Ukraine. The death toll soon climbed into the thousands, with hundreds of thousands of people displaced. In July 2014 a Russian-supplied missile shot down a Malaysian Airliner en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur with 298 people on board, all of whom died.If anyone argued in 2014, as Markov suggests, that Putin should have gotten a peace prize for not staging a massive, direct invasion of Ukraine to take the large cities of Kharkiv and Dnepropetrovsk, the Nobel Committee in Norway clearly was not persuaded. It gave the 2014 prize to Kailash Satyarthi and Malala Yousafzai ""for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education.""Russia’s record in Syria has been equally bloody since it entered the fight directly to support Assad in 2015.  One recent example was a Russian-Syrian military strike on a center for hundreds of displaced people in the town of Haas in Idlib that killed 20 civilians in August. A Human Rights Watch investigation published in October qualified the attack as “an apparent war crime.” Sara Kayyali who monitors the violations on the ground for HRW, tells The Daily Beast that “Russian strikes on protected humanitarian infrastructure” have been common in the areas where they operate, with “severely negative consequences.”Now, says Kayyali, “Russia has brokered an agreement with Turkey around a so-called ‘safe zone,’ but as history has proved again and again, safe zones are rarely safe.” President Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov gloated last week, saying, ""The United States was the closest ally of the Kurds during the last few years, and in the end the U.S. ditched the Kurds and effectively betrayed them."" By arranging for the withdrawal of the fighters, Peskov suggested, Russia is at least saving their lives. The United States looks foolish and treacherous, to be sure. But some analysts suggest Russia’s schadenfreude is premature. David Aaron Miller at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace notes that among some in Washington, “Animosity toward Trump and Putin—richly deserved—is clouding the analysis on Syria  and triggering overreaction about Russia’s gains.”As Miller points out, “Russia has been the dominant external power in Syria since at least the 1970s. And the U.S. withdrawal has no doubt consolidated that and elevated Russia’s role in the region. But we shouldn’t overestimate Moscow’s gains.  They now preside over a broken country that will take years and billions to heal. They are shackled with a pariah regime—both entitled and dependent—that will continue to alienate the majority of the Sunni population; they face a resurgent ISIS and are now shackled with responsibility for managing both the Turkish-Syrian-Kurdish triangle and a potential Israeli-Iranian conflict.”“The idea of giving Putin a Nobel Peace Prize sounds ridiculous after years of this dirty war in Syria, the Russian military violating international law, using banned weapons, bombing hospitals and clinics,” Tania Lokshina, Europe and Central Asia associate director at Human Rights Watch Moscow, told The Daily Beast. But still the dream lives on, revived by the agreement moving the Kurds out of the region near the Turkish border. Last week the Russian news agency riafan.ru headlined: “Foreigners propose to award Putin with a Nobel Prize for peace in Syria.” The deadline for Nobel nominations is January 31. One can only guess at the peace initiatives Putin will carry out between now and then.Is Trump Saving Those Syrian Oil Fields for the Russians?Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

India Farmers Plan Nationwide Protest Against 16-Nation Trade Deal,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 08:50:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/india-farmers-plan-nationwide-protest-125007797.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. India’s farmers’ organizations have planned a nationwide protest on Nov. 4 to demand that the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi keep agriculture out of a 16-nation trade agreement currently being negotiated in Thailand.The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, an umbrella organization of about 250 farmers unions from across the country, said that they will burn effigies depicting the China-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership or RCEP, to mark their protest and warn the government.Indian farmers won’t be able to compete should the country agree to cut duties for agricultural and dairy products in the proposed trade pact, said V.M. Singh, a convener of the the farmers’ group. Imports of dairy and agricultural products including wheat, cotton and oil seeds would affect the livelihood of millions of Indian farmers, he said.The government should defer signing of the agreement and hold consultations with farmers, state governments and other stake holders before taking a final decision, said Singh. “We have to stop RCEP,” he said.It is not clear yet what terms India will agree to in order to join what could become the world’s largest trade deal. The final stage of negotiations have begun in Bangkok and Indian trade minister Piyush Goyal will travel for the ministerial meeting there on Nov. 1. The nations are seeking to conclude the negotiations by November end.To contact the reporter on this story: Bibhudatta Pradhan in New Delhi at bpradhan@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ruth Pollard at rpollard2@bloomberg.net, Muneeza Naqvi, Abhay SinghFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GF2o4tZmPCtqpE8IuBOemg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/38b9b9b23d04b76ac5ea78347d209b84,India Farmers Plan Nationwide Protest Against 16-Nation Trade Deal

Authorities Identify ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe’ Through DNA and Now the Real Questions Start,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:13:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/authorities-identify-fly-creek-jane-131307745.html,"On a chilly February Sunday in 1980, a father and son panning for gold along Fly Creek in Clark County, Washington, kicked up the remains of a human skeleton that appeared to have been buried in a shallow grave. They called the authorities who came to collect the skull and what bones hadn’t been dragged away by animals, and were able to use the remains to construct a facial reconstruction that produced a picture of a teenage girl. Detectives were able to deduce that she died from a cause that did not seem natural. Calls for information, searches through missing persons reports, and detective work turned up nothing. No one seemed to miss the teen, dubbed the ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe,’ and, for the last 40 years, that is as far as the case went–until now.This summer Clark County detectives decided to post a DNA sample from the old remains to the Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, a public genealogy database that has had recent success closing old cold cases. The lab found a tie to a distant cousin of a teen named Sandra “Sandy” Renee Morden who said she was last seen in 1977–three years before her skeletal remains were found. Courtesy of Clark County SheriffThe Oregonian then dug up an old birthday announcement that was tied to the case. On April 29, 1977, in the classified section of the paper, a tiny ad appeared that said: “Sandra Renee Morden, Happy 15th Birthday. Love Always—Mom.” Such published greetings were a common way to mark a birthday or anniversary in the era before Facebook and other social media. Morden’s parents were divorced, according to the DNA-linked cousin, who does not want to be named and who provided Clark County cold-case detective Lindsay Schultz with the only clues the teen’s life. Schultz told the Oregonian that Morden was a “latchkey kid” who was mostly “unsupervised.” There is no indication that the parents filed a missing persons report, and, as Schultz says, “We didn’t have [the National Crime Information Center] at that time.” The detective says Morden’s parents came from the San Francisco area and settled in Portland. They split up in the early 1970s, and did not communicate with each other. The girl’s mother, identified as Kathryn Irene Morden, apparently lost custody and the cousin said Sandy most often stayed with her father, identified as Andrew Bain Morden, a Marine Corps veteran who fought in the Korean War. Schultz says she likely fell through the cracks when one parent thought the other had her. She last attended Wilson High School in Portland. Schultz told the Oregonian that the father likely thought she was with her mother. He had left her alone for an extended period of time and when he came back, she was gone, so he assumed she had gone to her mother’s home. “We don’t know for certain,” Schultz says. “We know that’s what family members believe.”Both parents are dead, so there is no way to confirm what either of them knew. Schultz told the Oregonian that it is the birthday greeting that bothers him most. It was posted around the time the extended family says she disappeared. “Was it just a mom who loved her daughter–or did her mom know something and put it out there for that reason?” Schultz said. “It’s one of those two, right? You ponder it. You look at it and you think, ‘What does it mean?’”Now detectives are looking for the missing puzzle pieces. They are calling on anyone who might have any information about Morden, her parents, or how she might have died to contact the Clark County Medical Examiner's Office or Clark County Sheriff's Office Cold Case Tip Line.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Singh, a convener of the the farmers’ group. Imports of dairy and agricultural products including wheat, cotton and oil seeds would affect the livelihood of millions of Indian farmers, he said.The government should defer signing of the agreement and hold consultations with farmers, state governments and other stake holders before taking a final decision, said Singh. “We have to stop RCEP,” he said.It is not clear yet what terms India will agree to in order to join what could become the world’s largest trade deal.

Authorities Identify ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe’ Through DNA and Now the Real Questions Start,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:13:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/authorities-identify-fly-creek-jane-131307745.html,"On a chilly February Sunday in 1980, a father and son panning for gold along Fly Creek in Clark County, Washington, kicked up the remains of a human skeleton that appeared to have been buried in a shallow grave. They called the authorities who came to collect the skull and what bones hadn’t been dragged away by animals, and were able to use the remains to construct a facial reconstruction that produced a picture of a teenage girl. Detectives were able to deduce that she died from a cause that did not seem natural. Calls for information, searches through missing persons reports, and detective work turned up nothing. No one seemed to miss the teen, dubbed the ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe,’ and, for the last 40 years, that is as far as the case went–until now.This summer Clark County detectives decided to post a DNA sample from the old remains to the Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, a public genealogy database that has had recent success closing old cold cases. The lab found a tie to a distant cousin of a teen named Sandra “Sandy” Renee Morden who said she was last seen in 1977–three years before her skeletal remains were found. Courtesy of Clark County SheriffThe Oregonian then dug up an old birthday announcement that was tied to the case. On April 29, 1977, in the classified section of the paper, a tiny ad appeared that said: “Sandra Renee Morden, Happy 15th Birthday. Love Always—Mom.” Such published greetings were a common way to mark a birthday or anniversary in the era before Facebook and other social media. Morden’s parents were divorced, according to the DNA-linked cousin, who does not want to be named and who provided Clark County cold-case detective Lindsay Schultz with the only clues the teen’s life. Schultz told the Oregonian that Morden was a “latchkey kid” who was mostly “unsupervised.” There is no indication that the parents filed a missing persons report, and, as Schultz says, “We didn’t have [the National Crime Information Center] at that time.” The detective says Morden’s parents came from the San Francisco area and settled in Portland. They split up in the early 1970s, and did not communicate with each other. The girl’s mother, identified as Kathryn Irene Morden, apparently lost custody and the cousin said Sandy most often stayed with her father, identified as Andrew Bain Morden, a Marine Corps veteran who fought in the Korean War. Schultz says she likely fell through the cracks when one parent thought the other had her. She last attended Wilson High School in Portland. Schultz told the Oregonian that the father likely thought she was with her mother. He had left her alone for an extended period of time and when he came back, she was gone, so he assumed she had gone to her mother’s home. “We don’t know for certain,” Schultz says. “We know that’s what family members believe.”Both parents are dead, so there is no way to confirm what either of them knew. Schultz told the Oregonian that it is the birthday greeting that bothers him most. It was posted around the time the extended family says she disappeared. “Was it just a mom who loved her daughter–or did her mom know something and put it out there for that reason?” Schultz said. “It’s one of those two, right? You ponder it. You look at it and you think, ‘What does it mean?’”Now detectives are looking for the missing puzzle pieces. They are calling on anyone who might have any information about Morden, her parents, or how she might have died to contact the Clark County Medical Examiner's Office or Clark County Sheriff's Office Cold Case Tip Line.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

"KGB Judged ‘Comrade V.V. Putin’ a Disciplined, Conscientious Spy","Thu, 31 Oct 2019 06:46:29 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/kgb-judged-comrade-v-v-104629972.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin was “prompt, disciplined and conscientious” as a spy in the KGB, according to a declassified profile from the Soviet Union’s feared security service.“Comrade V.V. Putin constantly improves his ideological and political standards,” according to the document exhibited at the Central State Archive for Historical-Political Documents of St. Petersburg, the Russian leader’s home city. “He’s actively engaged in party education work.”The profile, which is also on show at a Moscow exhibition of “outstanding figures” of modern Russian history, describes Putin as “morally upstanding” and enjoying “well-deserved authority among colleagues,” noting that he won a judo championship in 1978.Putin joined the KGB in 1975 after graduating from the law faculty of Leningrad State University, located in what’s now St. Petersburg, and served as a spy for more than 15 years until the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991. Putin asked to become a KGB officer even before he finished school, according to his Kremlin biography, which cites him saying his view of the organization “was based on idealistic stories I heard about intelligence.”He served in Dresden in East Germany from 1985 until 1990, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel during a largely undistinguished stint, and was awarded a bronze medal for service to the National People’s Army of the German Democratic Republic. He headed the Federal Security Service, the main successor agency of the KGB, in 1998-1999 before President Boris Yeltsin made him prime minister and named Putin as his chosen successor. Putin was elected president in 2000.The KGB’s appraisal of Putin, which appears to be from the late 1970s or early 1980s, was absolutely standard and showed that he hadn’t stood out or achieved anything in particular, according to Alexei Kondaurov, a former KGB general. “Usually we wrote ‘morally upstanding’ when there was nothing else to say,” he said.Still, there’s been “colossal” public interest in the document, shown as part of commemorations of the archive’s 90th anniversary, said Olga Bobrova, deputy head of the institution.To contact the reporters on this story: Irina Reznik in Moscow at ireznik@bloomberg.net;Henry Meyer in Moscow at hmeyer4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Gregory L.

Chris Christie Among Lawyers Making $15 Million in 1MDB Pact,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 12:10:31 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/chris-christie-among-lawyers-reaping-133349408.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest recovery ever from an American anti-corruption crackdown is proving lucrative for former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.A major deal struck by the U.S. for fugitive financier Jho Low to give up almost $1 billion in assets allegedly stolen from a Malaysian investment fund comes with a provision to pay his lawyers. As part of the 1MDB settlement, the Justice Department allowed for $15 million to be paid to a group advising Jho Low, including the law firm Christie set up after two terms as New Jersey’s governor.Those proceeds will come from Jho Low’s stake in EMI Music Publishing, which has grown to about $415 million. That investment ballooned after he initially put in a little more than $100 million stolen from 1MDB, according to prosecutors. The two sides agreed to the provision to allow the lawyers to extract fees from Low, whose assets and accounts have been seized or monitored by authorities across the world.“We were pleased to help negotiate this historic resolution in order to preserve the tremendous value of assets involved,” Christie said in a statement after the Justice Department announced the settlement agreement on Wednesday. It still needs approval from a federal judge.Christie, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 before dropping out and endorsing Donald Trump, set up his own law firm last year, the Christie Law Firm LLC. The other firms that will receive proceeds of the 1MDB deal for legal expenses are Kobre & Kim LLP and Lowenstein Sandler LLP.The agreement comes even before the criminal charges against Low have been resolved. In the settlement, the Justice Department cautioned that the released funds should be used only for the Low family’s legal fees and costs related to the lawsuits, and can’t be routed back to Low or his family.The cases were resolved in a “collaborative and fair way that includes payment of our legal fees,” said Robin Rathmell, a lawyer at Kobre & Kim.(Updates with lawyer’s comment in last paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Sridhar Natarajan in New York at snatarajan15@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

A Nobel Peace Prize for Vladimir Putin? That’s the Talk in Moscow.,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 05:40:49 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/nobel-peace-prize-vladimir-putin-094049080.html,"Adam Berry/GettyMOSCOW—For those who live outside Russia and the enormous bubble of admiration inflated around President Vladimir Putin, this story may be a bit hard to believe. But there is a movement afoot here, apparently in all sincerity, to nominate Putin for the Nobel Peace Prize.From the outside, one must wonder how the dossier for the former KGB operative might be prepared. Would it include the peace of the grave imposed on civilians in the Second Chechen War early in Putin’s presidency? Or would it be for backing quasi states broken away from the Republic of Georgia? Or, more recently, for the forcible annexation of Crimea and the instigation of a separatist war in Ukraine that continues to this day? Alex Gibney: How Donald Trump Is Morphing Into Vladimir PutinOr perhaps he’d win for Syria, where Putin is a strong supporter of the Assad dictatorship that has killed hundreds of thousands of people while half of the nation’s population has been driven into internal or external exile. Would that be the venue for Putin the peacemaker to earn his Nobel laurels?In fact, through the looking glass of Moscow’s media and Putin’s supporters, Ukraine and Syria are held up as prime examples of his eligibility for The Prize.The general secretary of the Russian-Turkish Public Forum, Sergey Markov, who is close to the Kremlin, tells The Daily Beast that there is no better candidate for the prestigious award than Putin: “Most Russian state officials believe that President Putin deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for saving the world from a nuclear war during the crisis in Ukraine in 2014—for holding back and not bringing Russian forces to Kharkiv, Dnepropetrovsk, [Ukrainian] cities full of Russian people,” Markov said, adding, “Of course Putin should be given the prize for solving the Turkish-Kurdish conflict, which risked taking thousands of lives.” Forget U.S. President Donald Trump’s efforts to claim credit for a ceasefire deal with Ankara, Putin’s supporters in Moscow believe that it was Putin alone who managed to find the solution and negotiate a deal with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that prevented a Turkish-Kurdish bloodbath. Whoever is responsible, the arrangement is essentially on Erdogan’s terms, opening the way for ethnic cleansing as Kurdish troops withdraw, Kurdish civilians flee, and Erdogan plans to move millions of Syrian Arabs, most of them from other parts of the country, into what Erdogan calls a “safe zone.”Yet Aleksey Venediktov, editor-in-chief of the influential independent radio station Echo of Moscow, tweeted last week as that deal came down: “They tell me at the top: ‘Now you understand, Putin deserves a Nobel Peace Prize.’” He said his high-level sources were telling him Putin’s Syria deal was like “the new Camp David Accord,” putting it on a par with the 1978 agreement brokered by President Jimmy Carter that ended generations of war between Israel and Egypt. In truth, the Russian leader has been looking to win The Prize for years. Ever since Time magazine put Putin on the cover as Person of the Year in 2007, the Kremlin’s ideologues have believed that the West recognizes Putin as the world’s preeminent politician—and peacemaker—and no wars in Georgia, Ukraine or Syria could dissuade them.Putin’s greatest accomplishment on that score probably came in 2013 when President Barack Obama was weighing the possibility of major military strikes on the Bashar al-Assad regime to retaliate for its use of chemical weapons, and Putin stepped in with a better—or at least more peaceful—plan. He persuaded Assad, first, to admit he had a chemical arsenal, which he had never done before. Then Assad agreed to U.N. inspections as he eliminated everything he admitted to having, and by all accounts the vast majority of those gruesome weapons were destroyed. At the time, that seemed like a major war averted, and therefore a pathway to peace.So at the beginning of 2014 a Russian advocacy group called the International Academy of Spiritual Unity and Cooperation of People put Putin up for the prize.Unfortunately for Putin’s aspirations, there’s quite a long delay between the nominations at the beginning of the year, and the awards at the end, and Putin was not exactly making peace in 2014. Reacting to a popular pro-European, largely anti-Russian uprising in Ukraine, he seized the Crimean Peninsula, annexed it to Russia, and poured support into separatist rebels in Eastern Ukraine. The death toll soon climbed into the thousands, with hundreds of thousands of people displaced. In July 2014 a Russian-supplied missile shot down a Malaysian Airliner en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur with 298 people on board, all of whom died.If anyone argued in 2014, as Markov suggests, that Putin should have gotten a peace prize for not staging a massive, direct invasion of Ukraine to take the large cities of Kharkiv and Dnepropetrovsk, the Nobel Committee in Norway clearly was not persuaded. It gave the 2014 prize to Kailash Satyarthi and Malala Yousafzai ""for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education.""Russia’s record in Syria has been equally bloody since it entered the fight directly to support Assad in 2015.  One recent example was a Russian-Syrian military strike on a center for hundreds of displaced people in the town of Haas in Idlib that killed 20 civilians in August. A Human Rights Watch investigation published in October qualified the attack as “an apparent war crime.” Sara Kayyali who monitors the violations on the ground for HRW, tells The Daily Beast that “Russian strikes on protected humanitarian infrastructure” have been common in the areas where they operate, with “severely negative consequences.”Now, says Kayyali, “Russia has brokered an agreement with Turkey around a so-called ‘safe zone,’ but as history has proved again and again, safe zones are rarely safe.” President Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov gloated last week, saying, ""The United States was the closest ally of the Kurds during the last few years, and in the end the U.S. ditched the Kurds and effectively betrayed them."" By arranging for the withdrawal of the fighters, Peskov suggested, Russia is at least saving their lives. The United States looks foolish and treacherous, to be sure. But some analysts suggest Russia’s schadenfreude is premature. David Aaron Miller at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace notes that among some in Washington, “Animosity toward Trump and Putin—richly deserved—is clouding the analysis on Syria  and triggering overreaction about Russia’s gains.”As Miller points out, “Russia has been the dominant external power in Syria since at least the 1970s. And the U.S. withdrawal has no doubt consolidated that and elevated Russia’s role in the region. But we shouldn’t overestimate Moscow’s gains.  They now preside over a broken country that will take years and billions to heal. They are shackled with a pariah regime—both entitled and dependent—that will continue to alienate the majority of the Sunni population; they face a resurgent ISIS and are now shackled with responsibility for managing both the Turkish-Syrian-Kurdish triangle and a potential Israeli-Iranian conflict.”“The idea of giving Putin a Nobel Peace Prize sounds ridiculous after years of this dirty war in Syria, the Russian military violating international law, using banned weapons, bombing hospitals and clinics,” Tania Lokshina, Europe and Central Asia associate director at Human Rights Watch Moscow, told The Daily Beast. But still the dream lives on, revived by the agreement moving the Kurds out of the region near the Turkish border. Last week the Russian news agency riafan.ru headlined: “Foreigners propose to award Putin with a Nobel Prize for peace in Syria.” The deadline for Nobel nominations is January 31. One can only guess at the peace initiatives Putin will carry out between now and then.Is Trump Saving Those Syrian Oil Fields for the Russians?Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Authorities Identify ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe’ Through DNA and Now the Real Questions Start,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:13:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/authorities-identify-fly-creek-jane-131307745.html,"On a chilly February Sunday in 1980, a father and son panning for gold along Fly Creek in Clark County, Washington, kicked up the remains of a human skeleton that appeared to have been buried in a shallow grave. They called the authorities who came to collect the skull and what bones hadn’t been dragged away by animals, and were able to use the remains to construct a facial reconstruction that produced a picture of a teenage girl. Detectives were able to deduce that she died from a cause that did not seem natural. Calls for information, searches through missing persons reports, and detective work turned up nothing. No one seemed to miss the teen, dubbed the ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe,’ and, for the last 40 years, that is as far as the case went–until now.This summer Clark County detectives decided to post a DNA sample from the old remains to the Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, a public genealogy database that has had recent success closing old cold cases. The lab found a tie to a distant cousin of a teen named Sandra “Sandy” Renee Morden who said she was last seen in 1977–three years before her skeletal remains were found. Courtesy of Clark County SheriffThe Oregonian then dug up an old birthday announcement that was tied to the case. On April 29, 1977, in the classified section of the paper, a tiny ad appeared that said: “Sandra Renee Morden, Happy 15th Birthday. Love Always—Mom.” Such published greetings were a common way to mark a birthday or anniversary in the era before Facebook and other social media. Morden’s parents were divorced, according to the DNA-linked cousin, who does not want to be named and who provided Clark County cold-case detective Lindsay Schultz with the only clues the teen’s life. Schultz told the Oregonian that Morden was a “latchkey kid” who was mostly “unsupervised.” There is no indication that the parents filed a missing persons report, and, as Schultz says, “We didn’t have [the National Crime Information Center] at that time.” The detective says Morden’s parents came from the San Francisco area and settled in Portland. They split up in the early 1970s, and did not communicate with each other. The girl’s mother, identified as Kathryn Irene Morden, apparently lost custody and the cousin said Sandy most often stayed with her father, identified as Andrew Bain Morden, a Marine Corps veteran who fought in the Korean War. Schultz says she likely fell through the cracks when one parent thought the other had her. She last attended Wilson High School in Portland. Schultz told the Oregonian that the father likely thought she was with her mother. He had left her alone for an extended period of time and when he came back, she was gone, so he assumed she had gone to her mother’s home. “We don’t know for certain,” Schultz says. “We know that’s what family members believe.”Both parents are dead, so there is no way to confirm what either of them knew. Schultz told the Oregonian that it is the birthday greeting that bothers him most. It was posted around the time the extended family says she disappeared. “Was it just a mom who loved her daughter–or did her mom know something and put it out there for that reason?” Schultz said. “It’s one of those two, right? You ponder it. You look at it and you think, ‘What does it mean?’”Now detectives are looking for the missing puzzle pieces. They are calling on anyone who might have any information about Morden, her parents, or how she might have died to contact the Clark County Medical Examiner's Office or Clark County Sheriff's Office Cold Case Tip Line.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Chris Christie Among Lawyers Making $15 Million in 1MDB Pact,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 12:10:31 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/chris-christie-among-lawyers-reaping-133349408.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest recovery ever from an American anti-corruption crackdown is proving lucrative for former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.A major deal struck by the U.S. for fugitive financier Jho Low to give up almost $1 billion in assets allegedly stolen from a Malaysian investment fund comes with a provision to pay his lawyers. As part of the 1MDB settlement, the Justice Department allowed for $15 million to be paid to a group advising Jho Low, including the law firm Christie set up after two terms as New Jersey’s governor.Those proceeds will come from Jho Low’s stake in EMI Music Publishing, which has grown to about $415 million. That investment ballooned after he initially put in a little more than $100 million stolen from 1MDB, according to prosecutors. The two sides agreed to the provision to allow the lawyers to extract fees from Low, whose assets and accounts have been seized or monitored by authorities across the world.“We were pleased to help negotiate this historic resolution in order to preserve the tremendous value of assets involved,” Christie said in a statement after the Justice Department announced the settlement agreement on Wednesday. It still needs approval from a federal judge.Christie, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 before dropping out and endorsing Donald Trump, set up his own law firm last year, the Christie Law Firm LLC. The other firms that will receive proceeds of the 1MDB deal for legal expenses are Kobre & Kim LLP and Lowenstein Sandler LLP.The agreement comes even before the criminal charges against Low have been resolved. In the settlement, the Justice Department cautioned that the released funds should be used only for the Low family’s legal fees and costs related to the lawsuits, and can’t be routed back to Low or his family.The cases were resolved in a “collaborative and fair way that includes payment of our legal fees,” said Robin Rathmell, a lawyer at Kobre & Kim.(Updates with lawyer’s comment in last paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Sridhar Natarajan in New York at snatarajan15@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

"KGB Judged ‘Comrade V.V. Putin’ a Disciplined, Conscientious Spy","Thu, 31 Oct 2019 06:46:29 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/kgb-judged-comrade-v-v-104629972.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin was “prompt, disciplined and conscientious” as a spy in the KGB, according to a declassified profile from the Soviet Union’s feared security service.“Comrade V.V. Putin constantly improves his ideological and political standards,” according to the document exhibited at the Central State Archive for Historical-Political Documents of St. Petersburg, the Russian leader’s home city. “He’s actively engaged in party education work.”The profile, which is also on show at a Moscow exhibition of “outstanding figures” of modern Russian history, describes Putin as “morally upstanding” and enjoying “well-deserved authority among colleagues,” noting that he won a judo championship in 1978.Putin joined the KGB in 1975 after graduating from the law faculty of Leningrad State University, located in what’s now St. Petersburg, and served as a spy for more than 15 years until the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991. Putin asked to become a KGB officer even before he finished school, according to his Kremlin biography, which cites him saying his view of the organization “was based on idealistic stories I heard about intelligence.”He served in Dresden in East Germany from 1985 until 1990, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel during a largely undistinguished stint, and was awarded a bronze medal for service to the National People’s Army of the German Democratic Republic. He headed the Federal Security Service, the main successor agency of the KGB, in 1998-1999 before President Boris Yeltsin made him prime minister and named Putin as his chosen successor. Putin was elected president in 2000.The KGB’s appraisal of Putin, which appears to be from the late 1970s or early 1980s, was absolutely standard and showed that he hadn’t stood out or achieved anything in particular, according to Alexei Kondaurov, a former KGB general. “Usually we wrote ‘morally upstanding’ when there was nothing else to say,” he said.Still, there’s been “colossal” public interest in the document, shown as part of commemorations of the archive’s 90th anniversary, said Olga Bobrova, deputy head of the institution.To contact the reporters on this story: Irina Reznik in Moscow at ireznik@bloomberg.net;Henry Meyer in Moscow at hmeyer4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Gregory L.

Authorities Identify ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe’ Through DNA and Now the Real Questions Start,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:13:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/authorities-identify-fly-creek-jane-131307745.html,"On a chilly February Sunday in 1980, a father and son panning for gold along Fly Creek in Clark County, Washington, kicked up the remains of a human skeleton that appeared to have been buried in a shallow grave. They called the authorities who came to collect the skull and what bones hadn’t been dragged away by animals, and were able to use the remains to construct a facial reconstruction that produced a picture of a teenage girl. Detectives were able to deduce that she died from a cause that did not seem natural. Calls for information, searches through missing persons reports, and detective work turned up nothing. No one seemed to miss the teen, dubbed the ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe,’ and, for the last 40 years, that is as far as the case went–until now.This summer Clark County detectives decided to post a DNA sample from the old remains to the Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, a public genealogy database that has had recent success closing old cold cases. The lab found a tie to a distant cousin of a teen named Sandra “Sandy” Renee Morden who said she was last seen in 1977–three years before her skeletal remains were found. Courtesy of Clark County SheriffThe Oregonian then dug up an old birthday announcement that was tied to the case. On April 29, 1977, in the classified section of the paper, a tiny ad appeared that said: “Sandra Renee Morden, Happy 15th Birthday. Love Always—Mom.” Such published greetings were a common way to mark a birthday or anniversary in the era before Facebook and other social media. Morden’s parents were divorced, according to the DNA-linked cousin, who does not want to be named and who provided Clark County cold-case detective Lindsay Schultz with the only clues the teen’s life. Schultz told the Oregonian that Morden was a “latchkey kid” who was mostly “unsupervised.” There is no indication that the parents filed a missing persons report, and, as Schultz says, “We didn’t have [the National Crime Information Center] at that time.” The detective says Morden’s parents came from the San Francisco area and settled in Portland. They split up in the early 1970s, and did not communicate with each other. The girl’s mother, identified as Kathryn Irene Morden, apparently lost custody and the cousin said Sandy most often stayed with her father, identified as Andrew Bain Morden, a Marine Corps veteran who fought in the Korean War. Schultz says she likely fell through the cracks when one parent thought the other had her. She last attended Wilson High School in Portland. Schultz told the Oregonian that the father likely thought she was with her mother. He had left her alone for an extended period of time and when he came back, she was gone, so he assumed she had gone to her mother’s home. “We don’t know for certain,” Schultz says. “We know that’s what family members believe.”Both parents are dead, so there is no way to confirm what either of them knew.

You ponder it. You look at it and you think, ‘What does it mean?’”Now detectives are looking for the missing puzzle pieces.

"KGB Judged ‘Comrade V.V. Putin’ a Disciplined, Conscientious Spy","Thu, 31 Oct 2019 06:46:29 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/kgb-judged-comrade-v-v-104629972.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin was “prompt, disciplined and conscientious” as a spy in the KGB, according to a declassified profile from the Soviet Union’s feared security service.“Comrade V.V. Putin constantly improves his ideological and political standards,” according to the document exhibited at the Central State Archive for Historical-Political Documents of St. Petersburg, the Russian leader’s home city. “He’s actively engaged in party education work.”The profile, which is also on show at a Moscow exhibition of “outstanding figures” of modern Russian history, describes Putin as “morally upstanding” and enjoying “well-deserved authority among colleagues,” noting that he won a judo championship in 1978.Putin joined the KGB in 1975 after graduating from the law faculty of Leningrad State University, located in what’s now St. Petersburg, and served as a spy for more than 15 years until the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991. Putin asked to become a KGB officer even before he finished school, according to his Kremlin biography, which cites him saying his view of the organization “was based on idealistic stories I heard about intelligence.”He served in Dresden in East Germany from 1985 until 1990, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel during a largely undistinguished stint, and was awarded a bronze medal for service to the National People’s Army of the German Democratic Republic. He headed the Federal Security Service, the main successor agency of the KGB, in 1998-1999 before President Boris Yeltsin made him prime minister and named Putin as his chosen successor. Putin was elected president in 2000.The KGB’s appraisal of Putin, which appears to be from the late 1970s or early 1980s, was absolutely standard and showed that he hadn’t stood out or achieved anything in particular, according to Alexei Kondaurov, a former KGB general. “Usually we wrote ‘morally upstanding’ when there was nothing else to say,” he said.Still, there’s been “colossal” public interest in the document, shown as part of commemorations of the archive’s 90th anniversary, said Olga Bobrova, deputy head of the institution.To contact the reporters on this story: Irina Reznik in Moscow at ireznik@bloomberg.net;Henry Meyer in Moscow at hmeyer4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Gregory L.

Why the Tories are cruising toward a big win in Britain,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 05:50:02 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/why-tories-cruising-toward-big-095002680.html,"The polling is clear. Over the more than three years since they voted to leave the European Union, British voters have come to regret their choice. Polls consistently show a several-point margin in favor of Remain, only one in three voters will endorse the proposition that getting Brexit over with is better than further delay, and two thirds believe that a no-deal Brexit should require another referendum.So why are Boris Johnson's Tories, running on a clearer stance for Brexit than ever before, currently projected to win a decisive victory in the December election?The simplest answer is: the opposition is divided. But that answer obscures more than it reveals, because it presumes that the question of Brexit is as dominant among the opposition as it is among the Tories. And the division of the opposition itself proves that this is not the case. On the contrary: Brexit is a truly existential question for a far larger fraction of Leave voters than it is of Remain voters, and that has had and continues to have material electoral consequences.Consider the largest opposition party. Labour under Jeremy Corbin has trended in an overwhelmingly left-wing direction, not only on economic matters but also on immigration and foreign policy. A ""no enemies on the left"" approach has even seen extremist illiberal and anti-Semitic elements gain a greater foothold within the party. But on Brexit, Corbyn has taken a somewhat ambiguous stance, reflecting the fact that while a majority of Labourites voted Remain, a not insignificant number had always been skeptical of an economic arrangement that gave financial interests greater influence at both the national and European levels of government.That combination of stridency and straddle hasn't played well in electoral terms, and has opened space for two other parties to establish themselves as alternatives: the Liberal Democrats, a longstanding centrist liberal party that has positioned itself as the unequivocal party of Remain, and the Brexit Party, a newly-minted political faction founded by Nigel Farage, the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party. At one point this past summer, both parties looked capable of surpassing the Tories, and possibly Labour as well.Since Boris Johnson took the premiership, though, the picture has changed dramatically. The Brexit party has fallen back to 10-12 percent in the polls, while the Tories have surged to the mid-to-high 30s. Moreover, Farage has intimated that he might cooperate with the Tories strategically, targeting constituencies where left-wing Leave voters are concentrated to pull them away from Labour, while staying away from seats that would be contested between the Remain-oriented Liberal Democrats and the Leave-oriented Tories.How could such a strategy work if Brexit is only getting less-popular with time? The answer comes down to intensity and cohesion.If Tory Remain voters -- of which there were many -- cared more about stopping Brexit than they did about the fate of their party, they would defect to the Liberal Democrats, badly damaging the Tories' chances of winning a majority. Similarly, if Labour Remain voters felt that Brexit was the most important issue, they would either have pushed Corbyn to a more decisive Remain stance, or would be working strategically with the Liberal Democrats in the way that the Brexit Party may work with the Tories. And the Liberal Democrats would be doing the same.But while Brexit may be a politically-defining event for the liberal center, for the left this is their first chance at power since the 1970s -- not something to be traded away lightly for the sake of free trade with Germany or even stability in Ireland. Even for liberal centrists, the choice between Corbyn and Johnson may be a tough one. For the right, meanwhile, the party as a whole seems to have come to realize that while the hard Leave voters are a minority in the country, they hold the balance of power within the Tory coalition. If they are not given the wheel, the coach isn't going anywhere.Now they have the wheel, and a Leave coalition looks likely to triumph decisively, in spite of all regrets.What happens then? The opposition could continue to come up with explanations for why the result doesn't truly reflect the will of the people -- blaming the electoral system, for instance (though in current polling the Tory-plus-Brexit coalition outpolls Labour-plus-Lib-Dems by an average of five points, suggesting even proportional representation would give victory to the Brexiteers). But they would be wiser to focus on the future. No longer dependent on the votes of Irish Unionists, nor needing to cater to the concerns of the Scottish Nationalists, a big Tory majority could govern from the center of England rather than Britain.The biggest post-Brexit challenge may not be how to get Britain back into Europe, but how to hold Britain itself together.Want more essential commentary and analysis like this delivered straight to your inbox?

Chris Christie Among Lawyers Making $15 Million in 1MDB Pact,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 12:10:31 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/chris-christie-among-lawyers-reaping-133349408.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest recovery ever from an American anti-corruption crackdown is proving lucrative for former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.A major deal struck by the U.S. for fugitive financier Jho Low to give up almost $1 billion in assets allegedly stolen from a Malaysian investment fund comes with a provision to pay his lawyers. As part of the 1MDB settlement, the Justice Department allowed for $15 million to be paid to a group advising Jho Low, including the law firm Christie set up after two terms as New Jersey’s governor.Those proceeds will come from Jho Low’s stake in EMI Music Publishing, which has grown to about $415 million. That investment ballooned after he initially put in a little more than $100 million stolen from 1MDB, according to prosecutors. The two sides agreed to the provision to allow the lawyers to extract fees from Low, whose assets and accounts have been seized or monitored by authorities across the world.“We were pleased to help negotiate this historic resolution in order to preserve the tremendous value of assets involved,” Christie said in a statement after the Justice Department announced the settlement agreement on Wednesday.

"KGB Judged ‘Comrade V.V. Putin’ a Disciplined, Conscientious Spy","Thu, 31 Oct 2019 06:46:29 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/kgb-judged-comrade-v-v-104629972.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin was “prompt, disciplined and conscientious” as a spy in the KGB, according to a declassified profile from the Soviet Union’s feared security service.“Comrade V.V. Putin constantly improves his ideological and political standards,” according to the document exhibited at the Central State Archive for Historical-Political Documents of St. Petersburg, the Russian leader’s home city. “He’s actively engaged in party education work.”The profile, which is also on show at a Moscow exhibition of “outstanding figures” of modern Russian history, describes Putin as “morally upstanding” and enjoying “well-deserved authority among colleagues,” noting that he won a judo championship in 1978.Putin joined the KGB in 1975 after graduating from the law faculty of Leningrad State University, located in what’s now St. Petersburg, and served as a spy for more than 15 years until the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991. Putin asked to become a KGB officer even before he finished school, according to his Kremlin biography, which cites him saying his view of the organization “was based on idealistic stories I heard about intelligence.”He served in Dresden in East Germany from 1985 until 1990, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel during a largely undistinguished stint, and was awarded a bronze medal for service to the National People’s Army of the German Democratic Republic. He headed the Federal Security Service, the main successor agency of the KGB, in 1998-1999 before President Boris Yeltsin made him prime minister and named Putin as his chosen successor. Putin was elected president in 2000.The KGB’s appraisal of Putin, which appears to be from the late 1970s or early 1980s, was absolutely standard and showed that he hadn’t stood out or achieved anything in particular, according to Alexei Kondaurov, a former KGB general. “Usually we wrote ‘morally upstanding’ when there was nothing else to say,” he said.Still, there’s been “colossal” public interest in the document, shown as part of commemorations of the archive’s 90th anniversary, said Olga Bobrova, deputy head of the institution.To contact the reporters on this story: Irina Reznik in Moscow at ireznik@bloomberg.net;Henry Meyer in Moscow at hmeyer4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Gregory L.

Why the Tories are cruising toward a big win in Britain,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 05:50:02 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/why-tories-cruising-toward-big-095002680.html,"The polling is clear. Over the more than three years since they voted to leave the European Union, British voters have come to regret their choice. Polls consistently show a several-point margin in favor of Remain, only one in three voters will endorse the proposition that getting Brexit over with is better than further delay, and two thirds believe that a no-deal Brexit should require another referendum.So why are Boris Johnson's Tories, running on a clearer stance for Brexit than ever before, currently projected to win a decisive victory in the December election?The simplest answer is: the opposition is divided. But that answer obscures more than it reveals, because it presumes that the question of Brexit is as dominant among the opposition as it is among the Tories. And the division of the opposition itself proves that this is not the case. On the contrary: Brexit is a truly existential question for a far larger fraction of Leave voters than it is of Remain voters, and that has had and continues to have material electoral consequences.Consider the largest opposition party. Labour under Jeremy Corbin has trended in an overwhelmingly left-wing direction, not only on economic matters but also on immigration and foreign policy. A ""no enemies on the left"" approach has even seen extremist illiberal and anti-Semitic elements gain a greater foothold within the party. But on Brexit, Corbyn has taken a somewhat ambiguous stance, reflecting the fact that while a majority of Labourites voted Remain, a not insignificant number had always been skeptical of an economic arrangement that gave financial interests greater influence at both the national and European levels of government.That combination of stridency and straddle hasn't played well in electoral terms, and has opened space for two other parties to establish themselves as alternatives: the Liberal Democrats, a longstanding centrist liberal party that has positioned itself as the unequivocal party of Remain, and the Brexit Party, a newly-minted political faction founded by Nigel Farage, the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party. At one point this past summer, both parties looked capable of surpassing the Tories, and possibly Labour as well.Since Boris Johnson took the premiership, though, the picture has changed dramatically. The Brexit party has fallen back to 10-12 percent in the polls, while the Tories have surged to the mid-to-high 30s. Moreover, Farage has intimated that he might cooperate with the Tories strategically, targeting constituencies where left-wing Leave voters are concentrated to pull them away from Labour, while staying away from seats that would be contested between the Remain-oriented Liberal Democrats and the Leave-oriented Tories.How could such a strategy work if Brexit is only getting less-popular with time? The answer comes down to intensity and cohesion.If Tory Remain voters -- of which there were many -- cared more about stopping Brexit than they did about the fate of their party, they would defect to the Liberal Democrats, badly damaging the Tories' chances of winning a majority. Similarly, if Labour Remain voters felt that Brexit was the most important issue, they would either have pushed Corbyn to a more decisive Remain stance, or would be working strategically with the Liberal Democrats in the way that the Brexit Party may work with the Tories. And the Liberal Democrats would be doing the same.But while Brexit may be a politically-defining event for the liberal center, for the left this is their first chance at power since the 1970s -- not something to be traded away lightly for the sake of free trade with Germany or even stability in Ireland. Even for liberal centrists, the choice between Corbyn and Johnson may be a tough one. For the right, meanwhile, the party as a whole seems to have come to realize that while the hard Leave voters are a minority in the country, they hold the balance of power within the Tory coalition. If they are not given the wheel, the coach isn't going anywhere.Now they have the wheel, and a Leave coalition looks likely to triumph decisively, in spite of all regrets.What happens then? The opposition could continue to come up with explanations for why the result doesn't truly reflect the will of the people -- blaming the electoral system, for instance (though in current polling the Tory-plus-Brexit coalition outpolls Labour-plus-Lib-Dems by an average of five points, suggesting even proportional representation would give victory to the Brexiteers). But they would be wiser to focus on the future. No longer dependent on the votes of Irish Unionists, nor needing to cater to the concerns of the Scottish Nationalists, a big Tory majority could govern from the center of England rather than Britain.The biggest post-Brexit challenge may not be how to get Britain back into Europe, but how to hold Britain itself together.Want more essential commentary and analysis like this delivered straight to your inbox?

Chris Christie Among Lawyers Making $15 Million in 1MDB Pact,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 12:10:31 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/chris-christie-among-lawyers-reaping-133349408.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest recovery ever from an American anti-corruption crackdown is proving lucrative for former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.A major deal struck by the U.S. for fugitive financier Jho Low to give up almost $1 billion in assets allegedly stolen from a Malaysian investment fund comes with a provision to pay his lawyers. As part of the 1MDB settlement, the Justice Department allowed for $15 million to be paid to a group advising Jho Low, including the law firm Christie set up after two terms as New Jersey’s governor.Those proceeds will come from Jho Low’s stake in EMI Music Publishing, which has grown to about $415 million.

Sign up here. India’s farmers’ organizations have planned a nationwide protest on Nov. 4 to demand that the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi keep agriculture out of a 16-nation trade agreement currently being negotiated in Thailand.The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, an umbrella organization of about 250 farmers unions from across the country, said that they will burn effigies depicting the China-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership or RCEP, to mark their protest and warn the government.Indian farmers won’t be able to compete should the country agree to cut duties for agricultural and dairy products in the proposed trade pact, said V.M. Singh, a convener of the the farmers’ group. Imports of dairy and agricultural products including wheat, cotton and oil seeds would affect the livelihood of millions of Indian farmers, he said.The government should defer signing of the agreement and hold consultations with farmers, state governments and other stake holders before taking a final decision, said Singh. “We have to stop RCEP,” he said.It is not clear yet what terms India will agree to in order to join what could become the world’s largest trade deal. The final stage of negotiations have begun in Bangkok and Indian trade minister Piyush Goyal will travel for the ministerial meeting there on Nov. 1.

Authorities Identify ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe’ Through DNA and Now the Real Questions Start,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:13:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/authorities-identify-fly-creek-jane-131307745.html,"On a chilly February Sunday in 1980, a father and son panning for gold along Fly Creek in Clark County, Washington, kicked up the remains of a human skeleton that appeared to have been buried in a shallow grave. They called the authorities who came to collect the skull and what bones hadn’t been dragged away by animals, and were able to use the remains to construct a facial reconstruction that produced a picture of a teenage girl. Detectives were able to deduce that she died from a cause that did not seem natural. Calls for information, searches through missing persons reports, and detective work turned up nothing. No one seemed to miss the teen, dubbed the ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe,’ and, for the last 40 years, that is as far as the case went–until now.This summer Clark County detectives decided to post a DNA sample from the old remains to the Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, a public genealogy database that has had recent success closing old cold cases. The lab found a tie to a distant cousin of a teen named Sandra “Sandy” Renee Morden who said she was last seen in 1977–three years before her skeletal remains were found. Courtesy of Clark County SheriffThe Oregonian then dug up an old birthday announcement that was tied to the case. On April 29, 1977, in the classified section of the paper, a tiny ad appeared that said: “Sandra Renee Morden, Happy 15th Birthday. Love Always—Mom.” Such published greetings were a common way to mark a birthday or anniversary in the era before Facebook and other social media. Morden’s parents were divorced, according to the DNA-linked cousin, who does not want to be named and who provided Clark County cold-case detective Lindsay Schultz with the only clues the teen’s life. Schultz told the Oregonian that Morden was a “latchkey kid” who was mostly “unsupervised.” There is no indication that the parents filed a missing persons report, and, as Schultz says, “We didn’t have [the National Crime Information Center] at that time.” The detective says Morden’s parents came from the San Francisco area and settled in Portland. They split up in the early 1970s, and did not communicate with each other. The girl’s mother, identified as Kathryn Irene Morden, apparently lost custody and the cousin said Sandy most often stayed with her father, identified as Andrew Bain Morden, a Marine Corps veteran who fought in the Korean War. Schultz says she likely fell through the cracks when one parent thought the other had her. She last attended Wilson High School in Portland. Schultz told the Oregonian that the father likely thought she was with her mother. He had left her alone for an extended period of time and when he came back, she was gone, so he assumed she had gone to her mother’s home. “We don’t know for certain,” Schultz says. “We know that’s what family members believe.”Both parents are dead, so there is no way to confirm what either of them knew. Schultz told the Oregonian that it is the birthday greeting that bothers him most. It was posted around the time the extended family says she disappeared. “Was it just a mom who loved her daughter–or did her mom know something and put it out there for that reason?” Schultz said. “It’s one of those two, right? You ponder it. You look at it and you think, ‘What does it mean?’”Now detectives are looking for the missing puzzle pieces. They are calling on anyone who might have any information about Morden, her parents, or how she might have died to contact the Clark County Medical Examiner's Office or Clark County Sheriff's Office Cold Case Tip Line.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Donald Trump Jr: I Wish I Was Like Hunter Biden So I Could ‘Make Millions Off of My Father’s Presidency’,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 07:22:50 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/donald-trump-jr-wish-hunter-034516851.html,"Donald Trump Jr., a man who shares the same name as the President of the United States and is currently the executive vice president of the Trump Organization, said with a straight face on Wednesday night that he wished his name was Hunter Biden so he could “make millions off my father's presidency.”During an appearance on Fox News’ Hannity to hawk his upcoming book Triggered, Trump Jr. quickly turned his sights on the impeachment inquiry his father is currently facing. After Trump Jr. called it a “sham” and claimed “the reasonable people in the middle” support his dad, Sean Hannity asked the presidential scion about former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The president is facing impeachment largely due to his efforts to pressure Ukraine to open investigations into the Democratic presidential nominee and his family.Insisting the media protects Biden and doesn’t report on unsubstantiated claims that the former veep forced Ukrainian leaders to drop investigations into his son, Hannity then wondered aloud what would happen if Trump Jr.’s name was Hunter Biden.“I wish my name was Hunter Biden,” the president’s eldest son said without a hint of irony. “I could go abroad, make millions off of my father’s presidency—I’d be a really rich guy! It would be incredible!”Trump Jr. then brought up unfounded allegations that Hunter Biden got a sweetheart $1.5 billion deal from China thanks to a desire by Beijing to curry favor with the then-vice president, claiming that if he got “$1.5 from China” the media’s “heads would explode.”“They would have an aneurysm—we’d end the fake news problem,” he concluded. “That is the double standard that we are living under right now.

Over the more than three years since they voted to leave the European Union, British voters have come to regret their choice. Polls consistently show a several-point margin in favor of Remain, only one in three voters will endorse the proposition that getting Brexit over with is better than further delay, and two thirds believe that a no-deal Brexit should require another referendum.So why are Boris Johnson's Tories, running on a clearer stance for Brexit than ever before, currently projected to win a decisive victory in the December election?The simplest answer is: the opposition is divided. But that answer obscures more than it reveals, because it presumes that the question of Brexit is as dominant among the opposition as it is among the Tories. And the division of the opposition itself proves that this is not the case. On the contrary: Brexit is a truly existential question for a far larger fraction of Leave voters than it is of Remain voters, and that has had and continues to have material electoral consequences.Consider the largest opposition party. Labour under Jeremy Corbin has trended in an overwhelmingly left-wing direction, not only on economic matters but also on immigration and foreign policy. A ""no enemies on the left"" approach has even seen extremist illiberal and anti-Semitic elements gain a greater foothold within the party. But on Brexit, Corbyn has taken a somewhat ambiguous stance, reflecting the fact that while a majority of Labourites voted Remain, a not insignificant number had always been skeptical of an economic arrangement that gave financial interests greater influence at both the national and European levels of government.That combination of stridency and straddle hasn't played well in electoral terms, and has opened space for two other parties to establish themselves as alternatives: the Liberal Democrats, a longstanding centrist liberal party that has positioned itself as the unequivocal party of Remain, and the Brexit Party, a newly-minted political faction founded by Nigel Farage, the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party. At one point this past summer, both parties looked capable of surpassing the Tories, and possibly Labour as well.Since Boris Johnson took the premiership, though, the picture has changed dramatically. The Brexit party has fallen back to 10-12 percent in the polls, while the Tories have surged to the mid-to-high 30s. Moreover, Farage has intimated that he might cooperate with the Tories strategically, targeting constituencies where left-wing Leave voters are concentrated to pull them away from Labour, while staying away from seats that would be contested between the Remain-oriented Liberal Democrats and the Leave-oriented Tories.How could such a strategy work if Brexit is only getting less-popular with time? The answer comes down to intensity and cohesion.If Tory Remain voters -- of which there were many -- cared more about stopping Brexit than they did about the fate of their party, they would defect to the Liberal Democrats, badly damaging the Tories' chances of winning a majority. Similarly, if Labour Remain voters felt that Brexit was the most important issue, they would either have pushed Corbyn to a more decisive Remain stance, or would be working strategically with the Liberal Democrats in the way that the Brexit Party may work with the Tories. And the Liberal Democrats would be doing the same.But while Brexit may be a politically-defining event for the liberal center, for the left this is their first chance at power since the 1970s -- not something to be traded away lightly for the sake of free trade with Germany or even stability in Ireland. Even for liberal centrists, the choice between Corbyn and Johnson may be a tough one. For the right, meanwhile, the party as a whole seems to have come to realize that while the hard Leave voters are a minority in the country, they hold the balance of power within the Tory coalition. If they are not given the wheel, the coach isn't going anywhere.Now they have the wheel, and a Leave coalition looks likely to triumph decisively, in spite of all regrets.What happens then? The opposition could continue to come up with explanations for why the result doesn't truly reflect the will of the people -- blaming the electoral system, for instance (though in current polling the Tory-plus-Brexit coalition outpolls Labour-plus-Lib-Dems by an average of five points, suggesting even proportional representation would give victory to the Brexiteers).

Sign up here. India’s farmers’ organizations have planned a nationwide protest on Nov. 4 to demand that the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi keep agriculture out of a 16-nation trade agreement currently being negotiated in Thailand.The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, an umbrella organization of about 250 farmers unions from across the country, said that they will burn effigies depicting the China-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership or RCEP, to mark their protest and warn the government.Indian farmers won’t be able to compete should the country agree to cut duties for agricultural and dairy products in the proposed trade pact, said V.M. Singh, a convener of the the farmers’ group. Imports of dairy and agricultural products including wheat, cotton and oil seeds would affect the livelihood of millions of Indian farmers, he said.The government should defer signing of the agreement and hold consultations with farmers, state governments and other stake holders before taking a final decision, said Singh. “We have to stop RCEP,” he said.It is not clear yet what terms India will agree to in order to join what could become the world’s largest trade deal. The final stage of negotiations have begun in Bangkok and Indian trade minister Piyush Goyal will travel for the ministerial meeting there on Nov. 1. The nations are seeking to conclude the negotiations by November end.To contact the reporter on this story: Bibhudatta Pradhan in New Delhi at bpradhan@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ruth Pollard at rpollard2@bloomberg.net, Muneeza Naqvi, Abhay SinghFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GF2o4tZmPCtqpE8IuBOemg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/38b9b9b23d04b76ac5ea78347d209b84,India Farmers Plan Nationwide Protest Against 16-Nation Trade Deal

Authorities Identify ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe’ Through DNA and Now the Real Questions Start,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:13:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/authorities-identify-fly-creek-jane-131307745.html,"On a chilly February Sunday in 1980, a father and son panning for gold along Fly Creek in Clark County, Washington, kicked up the remains of a human skeleton that appeared to have been buried in a shallow grave. They called the authorities who came to collect the skull and what bones hadn’t been dragged away by animals, and were able to use the remains to construct a facial reconstruction that produced a picture of a teenage girl. Detectives were able to deduce that she died from a cause that did not seem natural. Calls for information, searches through missing persons reports, and detective work turned up nothing. No one seemed to miss the teen, dubbed the ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe,’ and, for the last 40 years, that is as far as the case went–until now.This summer Clark County detectives decided to post a DNA sample from the old remains to the Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, a public genealogy database that has had recent success closing old cold cases. The lab found a tie to a distant cousin of a teen named Sandra “Sandy” Renee Morden who said she was last seen in 1977–three years before her skeletal remains were found. Courtesy of Clark County SheriffThe Oregonian then dug up an old birthday announcement that was tied to the case. On April 29, 1977, in the classified section of the paper, a tiny ad appeared that said: “Sandra Renee Morden, Happy 15th Birthday. Love Always—Mom.” Such published greetings were a common way to mark a birthday or anniversary in the era before Facebook and other social media. Morden’s parents were divorced, according to the DNA-linked cousin, who does not want to be named and who provided Clark County cold-case detective Lindsay Schultz with the only clues the teen’s life. Schultz told the Oregonian that Morden was a “latchkey kid” who was mostly “unsupervised.” There is no indication that the parents filed a missing persons report, and, as Schultz says, “We didn’t have [the National Crime Information Center] at that time.” The detective says Morden’s parents came from the San Francisco area and settled in Portland. They split up in the early 1970s, and did not communicate with each other. The girl’s mother, identified as Kathryn Irene Morden, apparently lost custody and the cousin said Sandy most often stayed with her father, identified as Andrew Bain Morden, a Marine Corps veteran who fought in the Korean War. Schultz says she likely fell through the cracks when one parent thought the other had her. She last attended Wilson High School in Portland. Schultz told the Oregonian that the father likely thought she was with her mother. He had left her alone for an extended period of time and when he came back, she was gone, so he assumed she had gone to her mother’s home. “We don’t know for certain,” Schultz says. “We know that’s what family members believe.”Both parents are dead, so there is no way to confirm what either of them knew. Schultz told the Oregonian that it is the birthday greeting that bothers him most. It was posted around the time the extended family says she disappeared. “Was it just a mom who loved her daughter–or did her mom know something and put it out there for that reason?” Schultz said. “It’s one of those two, right? You ponder it. You look at it and you think, ‘What does it mean?’”Now detectives are looking for the missing puzzle pieces. They are calling on anyone who might have any information about Morden, her parents, or how she might have died to contact the Clark County Medical Examiner's Office or Clark County Sheriff's Office Cold Case Tip Line.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

A Nobel Peace Prize for Vladimir Putin? That’s the Talk in Moscow.,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 05:40:49 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/nobel-peace-prize-vladimir-putin-094049080.html,"Adam Berry/GettyMOSCOW—For those who live outside Russia and the enormous bubble of admiration inflated around President Vladimir Putin, this story may be a bit hard to believe. But there is a movement afoot here, apparently in all sincerity, to nominate Putin for the Nobel Peace Prize.From the outside, one must wonder how the dossier for the former KGB operative might be prepared. Would it include the peace of the grave imposed on civilians in the Second Chechen War early in Putin’s presidency? Or would it be for backing quasi states broken away from the Republic of Georgia? Or, more recently, for the forcible annexation of Crimea and the instigation of a separatist war in Ukraine that continues to this day? Alex Gibney: How Donald Trump Is Morphing Into Vladimir PutinOr perhaps he’d win for Syria, where Putin is a strong supporter of the Assad dictatorship that has killed hundreds of thousands of people while half of the nation’s population has been driven into internal or external exile. Would that be the venue for Putin the peacemaker to earn his Nobel laurels?In fact, through the looking glass of Moscow’s media and Putin’s supporters, Ukraine and Syria are held up as prime examples of his eligibility for The Prize.The general secretary of the Russian-Turkish Public Forum, Sergey Markov, who is close to the Kremlin, tells The Daily Beast that there is no better candidate for the prestigious award than Putin: “Most Russian state officials believe that President Putin deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for saving the world from a nuclear war during the crisis in Ukraine in 2014—for holding back and not bringing Russian forces to Kharkiv, Dnepropetrovsk, [Ukrainian] cities full of Russian people,” Markov said, adding, “Of course Putin should be given the prize for solving the Turkish-Kurdish conflict, which risked taking thousands of lives.” Forget U.S. President Donald Trump’s efforts to claim credit for a ceasefire deal with Ankara, Putin’s supporters in Moscow believe that it was Putin alone who managed to find the solution and negotiate a deal with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that prevented a Turkish-Kurdish bloodbath. Whoever is responsible, the arrangement is essentially on Erdogan’s terms, opening the way for ethnic cleansing as Kurdish troops withdraw, Kurdish civilians flee, and Erdogan plans to move millions of Syrian Arabs, most of them from other parts of the country, into what Erdogan calls a “safe zone.”Yet Aleksey Venediktov, editor-in-chief of the influential independent radio station Echo of Moscow, tweeted last week as that deal came down: “They tell me at the top: ‘Now you understand, Putin deserves a Nobel Peace Prize.’” He said his high-level sources were telling him Putin’s Syria deal was like “the new Camp David Accord,” putting it on a par with the 1978 agreement brokered by President Jimmy Carter that ended generations of war between Israel and Egypt. In truth, the Russian leader has been looking to win The Prize for years. Ever since Time magazine put Putin on the cover as Person of the Year in 2007, the Kremlin’s ideologues have believed that the West recognizes Putin as the world’s preeminent politician—and peacemaker—and no wars in Georgia, Ukraine or Syria could dissuade them.Putin’s greatest accomplishment on that score probably came in 2013 when President Barack Obama was weighing the possibility of major military strikes on the Bashar al-Assad regime to retaliate for its use of chemical weapons, and Putin stepped in with a better—or at least more peaceful—plan. He persuaded Assad, first, to admit he had a chemical arsenal, which he had never done before. Then Assad agreed to U.N. inspections as he eliminated everything he admitted to having, and by all accounts the vast majority of those gruesome weapons were destroyed. At the time, that seemed like a major war averted, and therefore a pathway to peace.So at the beginning of 2014 a Russian advocacy group called the International Academy of Spiritual Unity and Cooperation of People put Putin up for the prize.Unfortunately for Putin’s aspirations, there’s quite a long delay between the nominations at the beginning of the year, and the awards at the end, and Putin was not exactly making peace in 2014. Reacting to a popular pro-European, largely anti-Russian uprising in Ukraine, he seized the Crimean Peninsula, annexed it to Russia, and poured support into separatist rebels in Eastern Ukraine. The death toll soon climbed into the thousands, with hundreds of thousands of people displaced. In July 2014 a Russian-supplied missile shot down a Malaysian Airliner en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur with 298 people on board, all of whom died.If anyone argued in 2014, as Markov suggests, that Putin should have gotten a peace prize for not staging a massive, direct invasion of Ukraine to take the large cities of Kharkiv and Dnepropetrovsk, the Nobel Committee in Norway clearly was not persuaded. It gave the 2014 prize to Kailash Satyarthi and Malala Yousafzai ""for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education.""Russia’s record in Syria has been equally bloody since it entered the fight directly to support Assad in 2015.  One recent example was a Russian-Syrian military strike on a center for hundreds of displaced people in the town of Haas in Idlib that killed 20 civilians in August. A Human Rights Watch investigation published in October qualified the attack as “an apparent war crime.” Sara Kayyali who monitors the violations on the ground for HRW, tells The Daily Beast that “Russian strikes on protected humanitarian infrastructure” have been common in the areas where they operate, with “severely negative consequences.”Now, says Kayyali, “Russia has brokered an agreement with Turkey around a so-called ‘safe zone,’ but as history has proved again and again, safe zones are rarely safe.” President Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov gloated last week, saying, ""The United States was the closest ally of the Kurds during the last few years, and in the end the U.S. ditched the Kurds and effectively betrayed them."" By arranging for the withdrawal of the fighters, Peskov suggested, Russia is at least saving their lives. The United States looks foolish and treacherous, to be sure. But some analysts suggest Russia’s schadenfreude is premature. David Aaron Miller at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace notes that among some in Washington, “Animosity toward Trump and Putin—richly deserved—is clouding the analysis on Syria  and triggering overreaction about Russia’s gains.”As Miller points out, “Russia has been the dominant external power in Syria since at least the 1970s. And the U.S. withdrawal has no doubt consolidated that and elevated Russia’s role in the region. But we shouldn’t overestimate Moscow’s gains.  They now preside over a broken country that will take years and billions to heal. They are shackled with a pariah regime—both entitled and dependent—that will continue to alienate the majority of the Sunni population; they face a resurgent ISIS and are now shackled with responsibility for managing both the Turkish-Syrian-Kurdish triangle and a potential Israeli-Iranian conflict.”“The idea of giving Putin a Nobel Peace Prize sounds ridiculous after years of this dirty war in Syria, the Russian military violating international law, using banned weapons, bombing hospitals and clinics,” Tania Lokshina, Europe and Central Asia associate director at Human Rights Watch Moscow, told The Daily Beast. But still the dream lives on, revived by the agreement moving the Kurds out of the region near the Turkish border. Last week the Russian news agency riafan.ru headlined: “Foreigners propose to award Putin with a Nobel Prize for peace in Syria.” The deadline for Nobel nominations is January 31. One can only guess at the peace initiatives Putin will carry out between now and then.Is Trump Saving Those Syrian Oil Fields for the Russians?Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Chris Christie Among Lawyers Making $15 Million in 1MDB Pact,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 12:10:31 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/chris-christie-among-lawyers-reaping-133349408.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest recovery ever from an American anti-corruption crackdown is proving lucrative for former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.A major deal struck by the U.S. for fugitive financier Jho Low to give up almost $1 billion in assets allegedly stolen from a Malaysian investment fund comes with a provision to pay his lawyers. As part of the 1MDB settlement, the Justice Department allowed for $15 million to be paid to a group advising Jho Low, including the law firm Christie set up after two terms as New Jersey’s governor.Those proceeds will come from Jho Low’s stake in EMI Music Publishing, which has grown to about $415 million. That investment ballooned after he initially put in a little more than $100 million stolen from 1MDB, according to prosecutors. The two sides agreed to the provision to allow the lawyers to extract fees from Low, whose assets and accounts have been seized or monitored by authorities across the world.“We were pleased to help negotiate this historic resolution in order to preserve the tremendous value of assets involved,” Christie said in a statement after the Justice Department announced the settlement agreement on Wednesday.

Authorities Identify ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe’ Through DNA and Now the Real Questions Start,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:13:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/authorities-identify-fly-creek-jane-131307745.html,"On a chilly February Sunday in 1980, a father and son panning for gold along Fly Creek in Clark County, Washington, kicked up the remains of a human skeleton that appeared to have been buried in a shallow grave. They called the authorities who came to collect the skull and what bones hadn’t been dragged away by animals, and were able to use the remains to construct a facial reconstruction that produced a picture of a teenage girl. Detectives were able to deduce that she died from a cause that did not seem natural. Calls for information, searches through missing persons reports, and detective work turned up nothing. No one seemed to miss the teen, dubbed the ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe,’ and, for the last 40 years, that is as far as the case went–until now.This summer Clark County detectives decided to post a DNA sample from the old remains to the Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, a public genealogy database that has had recent success closing old cold cases. The lab found a tie to a distant cousin of a teen named Sandra “Sandy” Renee Morden who said she was last seen in 1977–three years before her skeletal remains were found. Courtesy of Clark County SheriffThe Oregonian then dug up an old birthday announcement that was tied to the case. On April 29, 1977, in the classified section of the paper, a tiny ad appeared that said: “Sandra Renee Morden, Happy 15th Birthday. Love Always—Mom.” Such published greetings were a common way to mark a birthday or anniversary in the era before Facebook and other social media. Morden’s parents were divorced, according to the DNA-linked cousin, who does not want to be named and who provided Clark County cold-case detective Lindsay Schultz with the only clues the teen’s life. Schultz told the Oregonian that Morden was a “latchkey kid” who was mostly “unsupervised.” There is no indication that the parents filed a missing persons report, and, as Schultz says, “We didn’t have [the National Crime Information Center] at that time.” The detective says Morden’s parents came from the San Francisco area and settled in Portland. They split up in the early 1970s, and did not communicate with each other. The girl’s mother, identified as Kathryn Irene Morden, apparently lost custody and the cousin said Sandy most often stayed with her father, identified as Andrew Bain Morden, a Marine Corps veteran who fought in the Korean War. Schultz says she likely fell through the cracks when one parent thought the other had her. She last attended Wilson High School in Portland. Schultz told the Oregonian that the father likely thought she was with her mother. He had left her alone for an extended period of time and when he came back, she was gone, so he assumed she had gone to her mother’s home. “We don’t know for certain,” Schultz says. “We know that’s what family members believe.”Both parents are dead, so there is no way to confirm what either of them knew. Schultz told the Oregonian that it is the birthday greeting that bothers him most. It was posted around the time the extended family says she disappeared. “Was it just a mom who loved her daughter–or did her mom know something and put it out there for that reason?” Schultz said. “It’s one of those two, right? You ponder it. You look at it and you think, ‘What does it mean?’”Now detectives are looking for the missing puzzle pieces. They are calling on anyone who might have any information about Morden, her parents, or how she might have died to contact the Clark County Medical Examiner's Office or Clark County Sheriff's Office Cold Case Tip Line.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

"KGB Judged ‘Comrade V.V. Putin’ a Disciplined, Conscientious Spy","Thu, 31 Oct 2019 06:46:29 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/kgb-judged-comrade-v-v-104629972.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin was “prompt, disciplined and conscientious” as a spy in the KGB, according to a declassified profile from the Soviet Union’s feared security service.“Comrade V.V. Putin constantly improves his ideological and political standards,” according to the document exhibited at the Central State Archive for Historical-Political Documents of St. Petersburg, the Russian leader’s home city. “He’s actively engaged in party education work.”The profile, which is also on show at a Moscow exhibition of “outstanding figures” of modern Russian history, describes Putin as “morally upstanding” and enjoying “well-deserved authority among colleagues,” noting that he won a judo championship in 1978.Putin joined the KGB in 1975 after graduating from the law faculty of Leningrad State University, located in what’s now St. Petersburg, and served as a spy for more than 15 years until the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991. Putin asked to become a KGB officer even before he finished school, according to his Kremlin biography, which cites him saying his view of the organization “was based on idealistic stories I heard about intelligence.”He served in Dresden in East Germany from 1985 until 1990, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel during a largely undistinguished stint, and was awarded a bronze medal for service to the National People’s Army of the German Democratic Republic. He headed the Federal Security Service, the main successor agency of the KGB, in 1998-1999 before President Boris Yeltsin made him prime minister and named Putin as his chosen successor. Putin was elected president in 2000.The KGB’s appraisal of Putin, which appears to be from the late 1970s or early 1980s, was absolutely standard and showed that he hadn’t stood out or achieved anything in particular, according to Alexei Kondaurov, a former KGB general. “Usually we wrote ‘morally upstanding’ when there was nothing else to say,” he said.Still, there’s been “colossal” public interest in the document, shown as part of commemorations of the archive’s 90th anniversary, said Olga Bobrova, deputy head of the institution.To contact the reporters on this story: Irina Reznik in Moscow at ireznik@bloomberg.net;Henry Meyer in Moscow at hmeyer4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Gregory L.

Chris Christie Among Lawyers Making $15 Million in 1MDB Pact,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 12:10:31 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/chris-christie-among-lawyers-reaping-133349408.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest recovery ever from an American anti-corruption crackdown is proving lucrative for former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.A major deal struck by the U.S. for fugitive financier Jho Low to give up almost $1 billion in assets allegedly stolen from a Malaysian investment fund comes with a provision to pay his lawyers. As part of the 1MDB settlement, the Justice Department allowed for $15 million to be paid to a group advising Jho Low, including the law firm Christie set up after two terms as New Jersey’s governor.Those proceeds will come from Jho Low’s stake in EMI Music Publishing, which has grown to about $415 million. That investment ballooned after he initially put in a little more than $100 million stolen from 1MDB, according to prosecutors. The two sides agreed to the provision to allow the lawyers to extract fees from Low, whose assets and accounts have been seized or monitored by authorities across the world.“We were pleased to help negotiate this historic resolution in order to preserve the tremendous value of assets involved,” Christie said in a statement after the Justice Department announced the settlement agreement on Wednesday. It still needs approval from a federal judge.Christie, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 before dropping out and endorsing Donald Trump, set up his own law firm last year, the Christie Law Firm LLC.

Donald Trump Jr: I Wish I Was Like Hunter Biden So I Could ‘Make Millions Off of My Father’s Presidency’,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 07:22:50 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/donald-trump-jr-wish-hunter-034516851.html,"Donald Trump Jr., a man who shares the same name as the President of the United States and is currently the executive vice president of the Trump Organization, said with a straight face on Wednesday night that he wished his name was Hunter Biden so he could “make millions off my father's presidency.”During an appearance on Fox News’ Hannity to hawk his upcoming book Triggered, Trump Jr. quickly turned his sights on the impeachment inquiry his father is currently facing. After Trump Jr. called it a “sham” and claimed “the reasonable people in the middle” support his dad, Sean Hannity asked the presidential scion about former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The president is facing impeachment largely due to his efforts to pressure Ukraine to open investigations into the Democratic presidential nominee and his family.Insisting the media protects Biden and doesn’t report on unsubstantiated claims that the former veep forced Ukrainian leaders to drop investigations into his son, Hannity then wondered aloud what would happen if Trump Jr.’s name was Hunter Biden.“I wish my name was Hunter Biden,” the president’s eldest son said without a hint of irony. “I could go abroad, make millions off of my father’s presidency—I’d be a really rich guy! It would be incredible!”Trump Jr. then brought up unfounded allegations that Hunter Biden got a sweetheart $1.5 billion deal from China thanks to a desire by Beijing to curry favor with the then-vice president, claiming that if he got “$1.5 from China” the media’s “heads would explode.”“They would have an aneurysm—we’d end the fake news problem,” he concluded. “That is the double standard that we are living under right now. That is the double standard the American people are sick and tired of.”While the lack of self-awareness should be apparent, it should also be noted that while his father has been president, Trump Jr. has opened himself and his dad up to a whole host of conflict of interest issues. For example, a trip to India Trump Jr. took to sell his family’s condominium projects cost American taxpayers roughly $100,000.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Why the Tories are cruising toward a big win in Britain,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 05:50:02 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/why-tories-cruising-toward-big-095002680.html,"The polling is clear. Over the more than three years since they voted to leave the European Union, British voters have come to regret their choice. Polls consistently show a several-point margin in favor of Remain, only one in three voters will endorse the proposition that getting Brexit over with is better than further delay, and two thirds believe that a no-deal Brexit should require another referendum.So why are Boris Johnson's Tories, running on a clearer stance for Brexit than ever before, currently projected to win a decisive victory in the December election?The simplest answer is: the opposition is divided. But that answer obscures more than it reveals, because it presumes that the question of Brexit is as dominant among the opposition as it is among the Tories. And the division of the opposition itself proves that this is not the case. On the contrary: Brexit is a truly existential question for a far larger fraction of Leave voters than it is of Remain voters, and that has had and continues to have material electoral consequences.Consider the largest opposition party. Labour under Jeremy Corbin has trended in an overwhelmingly left-wing direction, not only on economic matters but also on immigration and foreign policy. A ""no enemies on the left"" approach has even seen extremist illiberal and anti-Semitic elements gain a greater foothold within the party. But on Brexit, Corbyn has taken a somewhat ambiguous stance, reflecting the fact that while a majority of Labourites voted Remain, a not insignificant number had always been skeptical of an economic arrangement that gave financial interests greater influence at both the national and European levels of government.That combination of stridency and straddle hasn't played well in electoral terms, and has opened space for two other parties to establish themselves as alternatives: the Liberal Democrats, a longstanding centrist liberal party that has positioned itself as the unequivocal party of Remain, and the Brexit Party, a newly-minted political faction founded by Nigel Farage, the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party. At one point this past summer, both parties looked capable of surpassing the Tories, and possibly Labour as well.Since Boris Johnson took the premiership, though, the picture has changed dramatically. The Brexit party has fallen back to 10-12 percent in the polls, while the Tories have surged to the mid-to-high 30s. Moreover, Farage has intimated that he might cooperate with the Tories strategically, targeting constituencies where left-wing Leave voters are concentrated to pull them away from Labour, while staying away from seats that would be contested between the Remain-oriented Liberal Democrats and the Leave-oriented Tories.How could such a strategy work if Brexit is only getting less-popular with time? The answer comes down to intensity and cohesion.If Tory Remain voters -- of which there were many -- cared more about stopping Brexit than they did about the fate of their party, they would defect to the Liberal Democrats, badly damaging the Tories' chances of winning a majority. Similarly, if Labour Remain voters felt that Brexit was the most important issue, they would either have pushed Corbyn to a more decisive Remain stance, or would be working strategically with the Liberal Democrats in the way that the Brexit Party may work with the Tories. And the Liberal Democrats would be doing the same.But while Brexit may be a politically-defining event for the liberal center, for the left this is their first chance at power since the 1970s -- not something to be traded away lightly for the sake of free trade with Germany or even stability in Ireland. Even for liberal centrists, the choice between Corbyn and Johnson may be a tough one. For the right, meanwhile, the party as a whole seems to have come to realize that while the hard Leave voters are a minority in the country, they hold the balance of power within the Tory coalition. If they are not given the wheel, the coach isn't going anywhere.Now they have the wheel, and a Leave coalition looks likely to triumph decisively, in spite of all regrets.What happens then? The opposition could continue to come up with explanations for why the result doesn't truly reflect the will of the people -- blaming the electoral system, for instance (though in current polling the Tory-plus-Brexit coalition outpolls Labour-plus-Lib-Dems by an average of five points, suggesting even proportional representation would give victory to the Brexiteers). But they would be wiser to focus on the future. No longer dependent on the votes of Irish Unionists, nor needing to cater to the concerns of the Scottish Nationalists, a big Tory majority could govern from the center of England rather than Britain.The biggest post-Brexit challenge may not be how to get Britain back into Europe, but how to hold Britain itself together.Want more essential commentary and analysis like this delivered straight to your inbox?

Authorities Identify ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe’ Through DNA and Now the Real Questions Start,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:13:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/authorities-identify-fly-creek-jane-131307745.html,"On a chilly February Sunday in 1980, a father and son panning for gold along Fly Creek in Clark County, Washington, kicked up the remains of a human skeleton that appeared to have been buried in a shallow grave. They called the authorities who came to collect the skull and what bones hadn’t been dragged away by animals, and were able to use the remains to construct a facial reconstruction that produced a picture of a teenage girl. Detectives were able to deduce that she died from a cause that did not seem natural. Calls for information, searches through missing persons reports, and detective work turned up nothing. No one seemed to miss the teen, dubbed the ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe,’ and, for the last 40 years, that is as far as the case went–until now.This summer Clark County detectives decided to post a DNA sample from the old remains to the Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, a public genealogy database that has had recent success closing old cold cases. The lab found a tie to a distant cousin of a teen named Sandra “Sandy” Renee Morden who said she was last seen in 1977–three years before her skeletal remains were found. Courtesy of Clark County SheriffThe Oregonian then dug up an old birthday announcement that was tied to the case. On April 29, 1977, in the classified section of the paper, a tiny ad appeared that said: “Sandra Renee Morden, Happy 15th Birthday. Love Always—Mom.” Such published greetings were a common way to mark a birthday or anniversary in the era before Facebook and other social media. Morden’s parents were divorced, according to the DNA-linked cousin, who does not want to be named and who provided Clark County cold-case detective Lindsay Schultz with the only clues the teen’s life. Schultz told the Oregonian that Morden was a “latchkey kid” who was mostly “unsupervised.” There is no indication that the parents filed a missing persons report, and, as Schultz says, “We didn’t have [the National Crime Information Center] at that time.” The detective says Morden’s parents came from the San Francisco area and settled in Portland. They split up in the early 1970s, and did not communicate with each other. The girl’s mother, identified as Kathryn Irene Morden, apparently lost custody and the cousin said Sandy most often stayed with her father, identified as Andrew Bain Morden, a Marine Corps veteran who fought in the Korean War. Schultz says she likely fell through the cracks when one parent thought the other had her. She last attended Wilson High School in Portland. Schultz told the Oregonian that the father likely thought she was with her mother. He had left her alone for an extended period of time and when he came back, she was gone, so he assumed she had gone to her mother’s home. “We don’t know for certain,” Schultz says. “We know that’s what family members believe.”Both parents are dead, so there is no way to confirm what either of them knew. Schultz told the Oregonian that it is the birthday greeting that bothers him most. It was posted around the time the extended family says she disappeared. “Was it just a mom who loved her daughter–or did her mom know something and put it out there for that reason?” Schultz said. “It’s one of those two, right? You ponder it. You look at it and you think, ‘What does it mean?’”Now detectives are looking for the missing puzzle pieces. They are calling on anyone who might have any information about Morden, her parents, or how she might have died to contact the Clark County Medical Examiner's Office or Clark County Sheriff's Office Cold Case Tip Line.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

A Nobel Peace Prize for Vladimir Putin? That’s the Talk in Moscow.,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 05:40:49 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/nobel-peace-prize-vladimir-putin-094049080.html,"Adam Berry/GettyMOSCOW—For those who live outside Russia and the enormous bubble of admiration inflated around President Vladimir Putin, this story may be a bit hard to believe. But there is a movement afoot here, apparently in all sincerity, to nominate Putin for the Nobel Peace Prize.From the outside, one must wonder how the dossier for the former KGB operative might be prepared. Would it include the peace of the grave imposed on civilians in the Second Chechen War early in Putin’s presidency? Or would it be for backing quasi states broken away from the Republic of Georgia? Or, more recently, for the forcible annexation of Crimea and the instigation of a separatist war in Ukraine that continues to this day? Alex Gibney: How Donald Trump Is Morphing Into Vladimir PutinOr perhaps he’d win for Syria, where Putin is a strong supporter of the Assad dictatorship that has killed hundreds of thousands of people while half of the nation’s population has been driven into internal or external exile. Would that be the venue for Putin the peacemaker to earn his Nobel laurels?In fact, through the looking glass of Moscow’s media and Putin’s supporters, Ukraine and Syria are held up as prime examples of his eligibility for The Prize.The general secretary of the Russian-Turkish Public Forum, Sergey Markov, who is close to the Kremlin, tells The Daily Beast that there is no better candidate for the prestigious award than Putin: “Most Russian state officials believe that President Putin deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for saving the world from a nuclear war during the crisis in Ukraine in 2014—for holding back and not bringing Russian forces to Kharkiv, Dnepropetrovsk, [Ukrainian] cities full of Russian people,” Markov said, adding, “Of course Putin should be given the prize for solving the Turkish-Kurdish conflict, which risked taking thousands of lives.” Forget U.S. President Donald Trump’s efforts to claim credit for a ceasefire deal with Ankara, Putin’s supporters in Moscow believe that it was Putin alone who managed to find the solution and negotiate a deal with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that prevented a Turkish-Kurdish bloodbath. Whoever is responsible, the arrangement is essentially on Erdogan’s terms, opening the way for ethnic cleansing as Kurdish troops withdraw, Kurdish civilians flee, and Erdogan plans to move millions of Syrian Arabs, most of them from other parts of the country, into what Erdogan calls a “safe zone.”Yet Aleksey Venediktov, editor-in-chief of the influential independent radio station Echo of Moscow, tweeted last week as that deal came down: “They tell me at the top: ‘Now you understand, Putin deserves a Nobel Peace Prize.’” He said his high-level sources were telling him Putin’s Syria deal was like “the new Camp David Accord,” putting it on a par with the 1978 agreement brokered by President Jimmy Carter that ended generations of war between Israel and Egypt. In truth, the Russian leader has been looking to win The Prize for years. Ever since Time magazine put Putin on the cover as Person of the Year in 2007, the Kremlin’s ideologues have believed that the West recognizes Putin as the world’s preeminent politician—and peacemaker—and no wars in Georgia, Ukraine or Syria could dissuade them.Putin’s greatest accomplishment on that score probably came in 2013 when President Barack Obama was weighing the possibility of major military strikes on the Bashar al-Assad regime to retaliate for its use of chemical weapons, and Putin stepped in with a better—or at least more peaceful—plan. He persuaded Assad, first, to admit he had a chemical arsenal, which he had never done before. Then Assad agreed to U.N. inspections as he eliminated everything he admitted to having, and by all accounts the vast majority of those gruesome weapons were destroyed. At the time, that seemed like a major war averted, and therefore a pathway to peace.So at the beginning of 2014 a Russian advocacy group called the International Academy of Spiritual Unity and Cooperation of People put Putin up for the prize.Unfortunately for Putin’s aspirations, there’s quite a long delay between the nominations at the beginning of the year, and the awards at the end, and Putin was not exactly making peace in 2014. Reacting to a popular pro-European, largely anti-Russian uprising in Ukraine, he seized the Crimean Peninsula, annexed it to Russia, and poured support into separatist rebels in Eastern Ukraine. The death toll soon climbed into the thousands, with hundreds of thousands of people displaced. In July 2014 a Russian-supplied missile shot down a Malaysian Airliner en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur with 298 people on board, all of whom died.If anyone argued in 2014, as Markov suggests, that Putin should have gotten a peace prize for not staging a massive, direct invasion of Ukraine to take the large cities of Kharkiv and Dnepropetrovsk, the Nobel Committee in Norway clearly was not persuaded. It gave the 2014 prize to Kailash Satyarthi and Malala Yousafzai ""for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education.""Russia’s record in Syria has been equally bloody since it entered the fight directly to support Assad in 2015.  One recent example was a Russian-Syrian military strike on a center for hundreds of displaced people in the town of Haas in Idlib that killed 20 civilians in August. A Human Rights Watch investigation published in October qualified the attack as “an apparent war crime.” Sara Kayyali who monitors the violations on the ground for HRW, tells The Daily Beast that “Russian strikes on protected humanitarian infrastructure” have been common in the areas where they operate, with “severely negative consequences.”Now, says Kayyali, “Russia has brokered an agreement with Turkey around a so-called ‘safe zone,’ but as history has proved again and again, safe zones are rarely safe.” President Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov gloated last week, saying, ""The United States was the closest ally of the Kurds during the last few years, and in the end the U.S. ditched the Kurds and effectively betrayed them."" By arranging for the withdrawal of the fighters, Peskov suggested, Russia is at least saving their lives. The United States looks foolish and treacherous, to be sure. But some analysts suggest Russia’s schadenfreude is premature. David Aaron Miller at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace notes that among some in Washington, “Animosity toward Trump and Putin—richly deserved—is clouding the analysis on Syria  and triggering overreaction about Russia’s gains.”As Miller points out, “Russia has been the dominant external power in Syria since at least the 1970s. And the U.S. withdrawal has no doubt consolidated that and elevated Russia’s role in the region. But we shouldn’t overestimate Moscow’s gains.  They now preside over a broken country that will take years and billions to heal. They are shackled with a pariah regime—both entitled and dependent—that will continue to alienate the majority of the Sunni population; they face a resurgent ISIS and are now shackled with responsibility for managing both the Turkish-Syrian-Kurdish triangle and a potential Israeli-Iranian conflict.”“The idea of giving Putin a Nobel Peace Prize sounds ridiculous after years of this dirty war in Syria, the Russian military violating international law, using banned weapons, bombing hospitals and clinics,” Tania Lokshina, Europe and Central Asia associate director at Human Rights Watch Moscow, told The Daily Beast. But still the dream lives on, revived by the agreement moving the Kurds out of the region near the Turkish border. Last week the Russian news agency riafan.ru headlined: “Foreigners propose to award Putin with a Nobel Prize for peace in Syria.” The deadline for Nobel nominations is January 31. One can only guess at the peace initiatives Putin will carry out between now and then.Is Trump Saving Those Syrian Oil Fields for the Russians?Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Chris Christie Among Lawyers Making $15 Million in 1MDB Pact,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 12:10:31 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/chris-christie-among-lawyers-reaping-133349408.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest recovery ever from an American anti-corruption crackdown is proving lucrative for former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.A major deal struck by the U.S. for fugitive financier Jho Low to give up almost $1 billion in assets allegedly stolen from a Malaysian investment fund comes with a provision to pay his lawyers. As part of the 1MDB settlement, the Justice Department allowed for $15 million to be paid to a group advising Jho Low, including the law firm Christie set up after two terms as New Jersey’s governor.Those proceeds will come from Jho Low’s stake in EMI Music Publishing, which has grown to about $415 million. That investment ballooned after he initially put in a little more than $100 million stolen from 1MDB, according to prosecutors. The two sides agreed to the provision to allow the lawyers to extract fees from Low, whose assets and accounts have been seized or monitored by authorities across the world.“We were pleased to help negotiate this historic resolution in order to preserve the tremendous value of assets involved,” Christie said in a statement after the Justice Department announced the settlement agreement on Wednesday. It still needs approval from a federal judge.Christie, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 before dropping out and endorsing Donald Trump, set up his own law firm last year, the Christie Law Firm LLC. The other firms that will receive proceeds of the 1MDB deal for legal expenses are Kobre & Kim LLP and Lowenstein Sandler LLP.The agreement comes even before the criminal charges against Low have been resolved. In the settlement, the Justice Department cautioned that the released funds should be used only for the Low family’s legal fees and costs related to the lawsuits, and can’t be routed back to Low or his family.The cases were resolved in a “collaborative and fair way that includes payment of our legal fees,” said Robin Rathmell, a lawyer at Kobre & Kim.(Updates with lawyer’s comment in last paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Sridhar Natarajan in New York at snatarajan15@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

Singh, a convener of the the farmers’ group. Imports of dairy and agricultural products including wheat, cotton and oil seeds would affect the livelihood of millions of Indian farmers, he said.The government should defer signing of the agreement and hold consultations with farmers, state governments and other stake holders before taking a final decision, said Singh. “We have to stop RCEP,” he said.It is not clear yet what terms India will agree to in order to join what could become the world’s largest trade deal. The final stage of negotiations have begun in Bangkok and Indian trade minister Piyush Goyal will travel for the ministerial meeting there on Nov. 1.

Why the Tories are cruising toward a big win in Britain,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 05:50:02 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/why-tories-cruising-toward-big-095002680.html,"The polling is clear. Over the more than three years since they voted to leave the European Union, British voters have come to regret their choice. Polls consistently show a several-point margin in favor of Remain, only one in three voters will endorse the proposition that getting Brexit over with is better than further delay, and two thirds believe that a no-deal Brexit should require another referendum.So why are Boris Johnson's Tories, running on a clearer stance for Brexit than ever before, currently projected to win a decisive victory in the December election?The simplest answer is: the opposition is divided. But that answer obscures more than it reveals, because it presumes that the question of Brexit is as dominant among the opposition as it is among the Tories. And the division of the opposition itself proves that this is not the case. On the contrary: Brexit is a truly existential question for a far larger fraction of Leave voters than it is of Remain voters, and that has had and continues to have material electoral consequences.Consider the largest opposition party. Labour under Jeremy Corbin has trended in an overwhelmingly left-wing direction, not only on economic matters but also on immigration and foreign policy. A ""no enemies on the left"" approach has even seen extremist illiberal and anti-Semitic elements gain a greater foothold within the party. But on Brexit, Corbyn has taken a somewhat ambiguous stance, reflecting the fact that while a majority of Labourites voted Remain, a not insignificant number had always been skeptical of an economic arrangement that gave financial interests greater influence at both the national and European levels of government.That combination of stridency and straddle hasn't played well in electoral terms, and has opened space for two other parties to establish themselves as alternatives: the Liberal Democrats, a longstanding centrist liberal party that has positioned itself as the unequivocal party of Remain, and the Brexit Party, a newly-minted political faction founded by Nigel Farage, the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party. At one point this past summer, both parties looked capable of surpassing the Tories, and possibly Labour as well.Since Boris Johnson took the premiership, though, the picture has changed dramatically. The Brexit party has fallen back to 10-12 percent in the polls, while the Tories have surged to the mid-to-high 30s. Moreover, Farage has intimated that he might cooperate with the Tories strategically, targeting constituencies where left-wing Leave voters are concentrated to pull them away from Labour, while staying away from seats that would be contested between the Remain-oriented Liberal Democrats and the Leave-oriented Tories.How could such a strategy work if Brexit is only getting less-popular with time? The answer comes down to intensity and cohesion.If Tory Remain voters -- of which there were many -- cared more about stopping Brexit than they did about the fate of their party, they would defect to the Liberal Democrats, badly damaging the Tories' chances of winning a majority. Similarly, if Labour Remain voters felt that Brexit was the most important issue, they would either have pushed Corbyn to a more decisive Remain stance, or would be working strategically with the Liberal Democrats in the way that the Brexit Party may work with the Tories. And the Liberal Democrats would be doing the same.But while Brexit may be a politically-defining event for the liberal center, for the left this is their first chance at power since the 1970s -- not something to be traded away lightly for the sake of free trade with Germany or even stability in Ireland. Even for liberal centrists, the choice between Corbyn and Johnson may be a tough one. For the right, meanwhile, the party as a whole seems to have come to realize that while the hard Leave voters are a minority in the country, they hold the balance of power within the Tory coalition. If they are not given the wheel, the coach isn't going anywhere.Now they have the wheel, and a Leave coalition looks likely to triumph decisively, in spite of all regrets.What happens then? The opposition could continue to come up with explanations for why the result doesn't truly reflect the will of the people -- blaming the electoral system, for instance (though in current polling the Tory-plus-Brexit coalition outpolls Labour-plus-Lib-Dems by an average of five points, suggesting even proportional representation would give victory to the Brexiteers). But they would be wiser to focus on the future. No longer dependent on the votes of Irish Unionists, nor needing to cater to the concerns of the Scottish Nationalists, a big Tory majority could govern from the center of England rather than Britain.The biggest post-Brexit challenge may not be how to get Britain back into Europe, but how to hold Britain itself together.Want more essential commentary and analysis like this delivered straight to your inbox?

Authorities Identify ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe’ Through DNA and Now the Real Questions Start,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:13:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/authorities-identify-fly-creek-jane-131307745.html,"On a chilly February Sunday in 1980, a father and son panning for gold along Fly Creek in Clark County, Washington, kicked up the remains of a human skeleton that appeared to have been buried in a shallow grave. They called the authorities who came to collect the skull and what bones hadn’t been dragged away by animals, and were able to use the remains to construct a facial reconstruction that produced a picture of a teenage girl. Detectives were able to deduce that she died from a cause that did not seem natural. Calls for information, searches through missing persons reports, and detective work turned up nothing. No one seemed to miss the teen, dubbed the ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe,’ and, for the last 40 years, that is as far as the case went–until now.This summer Clark County detectives decided to post a DNA sample from the old remains to the Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, a public genealogy database that has had recent success closing old cold cases. The lab found a tie to a distant cousin of a teen named Sandra “Sandy” Renee Morden who said she was last seen in 1977–three years before her skeletal remains were found. Courtesy of Clark County SheriffThe Oregonian then dug up an old birthday announcement that was tied to the case. On April 29, 1977, in the classified section of the paper, a tiny ad appeared that said: “Sandra Renee Morden, Happy 15th Birthday. Love Always—Mom.” Such published greetings were a common way to mark a birthday or anniversary in the era before Facebook and other social media. Morden’s parents were divorced, according to the DNA-linked cousin, who does not want to be named and who provided Clark County cold-case detective Lindsay Schultz with the only clues the teen’s life. Schultz told the Oregonian that Morden was a “latchkey kid” who was mostly “unsupervised.” There is no indication that the parents filed a missing persons report, and, as Schultz says, “We didn’t have [the National Crime Information Center] at that time.” The detective says Morden’s parents came from the San Francisco area and settled in Portland. They split up in the early 1970s, and did not communicate with each other. The girl’s mother, identified as Kathryn Irene Morden, apparently lost custody and the cousin said Sandy most often stayed with her father, identified as Andrew Bain Morden, a Marine Corps veteran who fought in the Korean War. Schultz says she likely fell through the cracks when one parent thought the other had her. She last attended Wilson High School in Portland. Schultz told the Oregonian that the father likely thought she was with her mother. He had left her alone for an extended period of time and when he came back, she was gone, so he assumed she had gone to her mother’s home. “We don’t know for certain,” Schultz says. “We know that’s what family members believe.”Both parents are dead, so there is no way to confirm what either of them knew. Schultz told the Oregonian that it is the birthday greeting that bothers him most. It was posted around the time the extended family says she disappeared. “Was it just a mom who loved her daughter–or did her mom know something and put it out there for that reason?” Schultz said. “It’s one of those two, right? You ponder it. You look at it and you think, ‘What does it mean?’”Now detectives are looking for the missing puzzle pieces. They are calling on anyone who might have any information about Morden, her parents, or how she might have died to contact the Clark County Medical Examiner's Office or Clark County Sheriff's Office Cold Case Tip Line.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Netflix Drops Horrifying Camp Fire Documentary ‘Fire in Paradise’ as California Burns,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 05:39:58 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/netflix-drops-horrifying-camp-fire-093958850.html,"Karl Mondon/GettyLike people, wildfires aren’t born coherent or fully formed. They rarely have one direction or one goal. Fires are fluid and disparate, made up of smaller blazes and embers, some of which might merge into irrational explosions or veer off in different directions. (Scientists have dubbed this odd meandering, not “fire movement” or “fire patterns,” but “fire behavior”). Today, Los Angeles, like Sonoma County, is on fire. The city smells like everyone is having a cookout. On maps, the evacuation zone is drawn in hard lines, starting just five miles from where I’m writing this—a box framed by Mulholland Drive in the north, the 405 in the east, Sunset Boulevard in the south and Temescal Canyon Road in the west. But with hurricane-like winds predicted this week, there remains some uncertainty about just where, exactly, the blaze might go. Unlike actual flames, the stories of fire have a predictable arc: low humidity, dry fuel, some small ignition (a cigarette, a powerline), ferocious wind, dispatch calls, mobile alerts, confused evacuators, missing heirlooms, lost lives, thousands of tired firefighters, and later, aerial photos of the earth, burnt into a scar. The familiarity makes the worst fire stories the hardest to tell. How do you capture the chaos of a place like Paradise—leveled last year by the Camp Fire, California’s deadliest in a century—when we all know the end? One hundred and fifty thousand acres burned. Nineteen thousand structures were destroyed. Eighty-five people, most of them disabled or elderly, dead. In that sense, Fire in Paradise, a new documentary directed by Drea Cooper and Zackary Canepari which streams on Netflix this Friday, doesn’t break ground. The tight, 40-minute film isn’t an exercise in narrative form. There’s no narration at all. It’s a time capsule—a minute-by-minute replay, told by the people who lived it and spliced with source footage: dispatch calls, cellphone videos, and clips from an eerily upbeat weatherman. But it’s also a forecast, both for what the state will undergo these next few weeks, and what will replay in fire seasons to come. Inside L.A.’s High-End Getty Fire Evacuation CenterThe Weird Weather Fanning the Flames in CaliforniaFire in Paradise opens with an omen—at once self-conscious and effective. The camera pans on a forest, dry but unburned. An answering machine beeps in the background and a robocall sets the scene. “This is an important safety alert from Pacific Gas & Electric Company,” the monotone voice says. “Extreme weather conditions and high fire danger are forecasted in Butte County, starting Thursday, November 8, 2018.” Months after that morning, investigators would find the utility company responsible for as many as 10 of the fires which scorched the state last year. It’s another reminder of the film as forecast—this season, PG&E; has already taken heat for at least one inferno, and cutting power to millions across the state, leaving some to escape in the dark with little warning. As the voiceover continues, a square screen appears over the forest, playing a montage of home videos. Families bowl; a man fishes; couples dance and swim; kids dressed as cowboys hop a potato-sack race. “To protect public safety,” the robovoice goes on, “PG&E; may temporarily turn off power in your neighborhood or community.” The screen goes black. “Please have your emergency plan ready.”The account of the following hours unfold through interviews with residents and first responders—when they heard about the fire, when they got scared, when they fled. The most powerful moments don’t come from the speakers describing the fire. One of the unnerving things about extreme natural disasters is how language fails to keep pace with their severity: “It got bad real quick,” one dispatcher says. Another resident echoes: “It felt unreal.” Instead, the strongest scenes emerge from people describing people. At one point, an auburn-haired teacher named Mary Ludwig recalls boarding a bus filled with students, watching them yawn from the low-oxygen air, and making impromptu masks from the driver’s shirt and the sole water bottle on board. She hoped they wouldn’t work: “We prayed that we would die of smoke inhalation.” Later, resident Joy Beeson, a wry elderly woman with blue nail polish and a pink fleece, describes escaping with her son. “I ran out in my Skechers and my pajamas,” she says. “I was running out of breath, and my son put his hand on my back and said, ‘You’ve got to run now, Mama.’” When Beeson pushed ahead, a burning tree fell where she stood just seconds before: “My son saved my life.” A third survivor, a Cal Fire captain named Sean Norman, remembers evacuating a family that didn’t want to leave. If you don’t go, he told them, you will die. As the fire bore down, Norman couldn’t keep convincing them. He fled. “They survived,” he says, choking up. “They don’t like me very much. But at least they’re around to not like me.” Still, what makes Fire in Paradise essential viewing isn’t anything the subjects said or the directors captured. It comes from the amateurs, from the cellphone videos filmed from inside cars or while fleeing on foot. Near the end of the movie, the inevitable aerial shot arrives, revealing city blocks reduced to black squares. In the background, newscasters list unthinkable numbers: 77 deaths so far, 1,000 missing people. Then, the camera cuts to a stunning recording. It’s shot by an anonymous man walking through his old town. The landscape is so scorched the tape looks sepia. Only a few faint colors (a fleck of car paint, a blue flame) prove otherwise. The man pans toward the remains of a few cars, narrating in a squeaky voice. “Now this is the poor guy,” he says, “came down to get my crippled friend out.” He zooms in on the front car. It could be a Honda or a Dodge or a Geo or really any smallish, average car. Identifying markers have all been burned away. “He didn’t make it. None of these people made it down here. These people all got burnt up. I was right down below them here.” The man approaches the shattered windshield, focusing on the hollowed-out front seats. “My friend, you can see he’s dead.” In fact, you can’t see it. The images are unintelligible, all abstract lumps and black lines. But then he pans to a window, and something comes into focus: a blackened skull, and beneath it, bones.

Chris Christie Among Lawyers Making $15 Million in 1MDB Pact,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 12:10:31 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/chris-christie-among-lawyers-reaping-133349408.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest recovery ever from an American anti-corruption crackdown is proving lucrative for former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.A major deal struck by the U.S. for fugitive financier Jho Low to give up almost $1 billion in assets allegedly stolen from a Malaysian investment fund comes with a provision to pay his lawyers. As part of the 1MDB settlement, the Justice Department allowed for $15 million to be paid to a group advising Jho Low, including the law firm Christie set up after two terms as New Jersey’s governor.Those proceeds will come from Jho Low’s stake in EMI Music Publishing, which has grown to about $415 million. That investment ballooned after he initially put in a little more than $100 million stolen from 1MDB, according to prosecutors. The two sides agreed to the provision to allow the lawyers to extract fees from Low, whose assets and accounts have been seized or monitored by authorities across the world.“We were pleased to help negotiate this historic resolution in order to preserve the tremendous value of assets involved,” Christie said in a statement after the Justice Department announced the settlement agreement on Wednesday. It still needs approval from a federal judge.Christie, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 before dropping out and endorsing Donald Trump, set up his own law firm last year, the Christie Law Firm LLC. The other firms that will receive proceeds of the 1MDB deal for legal expenses are Kobre & Kim LLP and Lowenstein Sandler LLP.The agreement comes even before the criminal charges against Low have been resolved. In the settlement, the Justice Department cautioned that the released funds should be used only for the Low family’s legal fees and costs related to the lawsuits, and can’t be routed back to Low or his family.The cases were resolved in a “collaborative and fair way that includes payment of our legal fees,” said Robin Rathmell, a lawyer at Kobre & Kim.(Updates with lawyer’s comment in last paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Sridhar Natarajan in New York at snatarajan15@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

Sign up here. India’s farmers’ organizations have planned a nationwide protest on Nov. 4 to demand that the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi keep agriculture out of a 16-nation trade agreement currently being negotiated in Thailand.The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, an umbrella organization of about 250 farmers unions from across the country, said that they will burn effigies depicting the China-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership or RCEP, to mark their protest and warn the government.Indian farmers won’t be able to compete should the country agree to cut duties for agricultural and dairy products in the proposed trade pact, said V.M. Singh, a convener of the the farmers’ group. Imports of dairy and agricultural products including wheat, cotton and oil seeds would affect the livelihood of millions of Indian farmers, he said.The government should defer signing of the agreement and hold consultations with farmers, state governments and other stake holders before taking a final decision, said Singh. “We have to stop RCEP,” he said.It is not clear yet what terms India will agree to in order to join what could become the world’s largest trade deal. The final stage of negotiations have begun in Bangkok and Indian trade minister Piyush Goyal will travel for the ministerial meeting there on Nov. 1.

Why the Tories are cruising toward a big win in Britain,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 05:50:02 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/why-tories-cruising-toward-big-095002680.html,"The polling is clear. Over the more than three years since they voted to leave the European Union, British voters have come to regret their choice. Polls consistently show a several-point margin in favor of Remain, only one in three voters will endorse the proposition that getting Brexit over with is better than further delay, and two thirds believe that a no-deal Brexit should require another referendum.So why are Boris Johnson's Tories, running on a clearer stance for Brexit than ever before, currently projected to win a decisive victory in the December election?The simplest answer is: the opposition is divided. But that answer obscures more than it reveals, because it presumes that the question of Brexit is as dominant among the opposition as it is among the Tories. And the division of the opposition itself proves that this is not the case. On the contrary: Brexit is a truly existential question for a far larger fraction of Leave voters than it is of Remain voters, and that has had and continues to have material electoral consequences.Consider the largest opposition party. Labour under Jeremy Corbin has trended in an overwhelmingly left-wing direction, not only on economic matters but also on immigration and foreign policy. A ""no enemies on the left"" approach has even seen extremist illiberal and anti-Semitic elements gain a greater foothold within the party. But on Brexit, Corbyn has taken a somewhat ambiguous stance, reflecting the fact that while a majority of Labourites voted Remain, a not insignificant number had always been skeptical of an economic arrangement that gave financial interests greater influence at both the national and European levels of government.That combination of stridency and straddle hasn't played well in electoral terms, and has opened space for two other parties to establish themselves as alternatives: the Liberal Democrats, a longstanding centrist liberal party that has positioned itself as the unequivocal party of Remain, and the Brexit Party, a newly-minted political faction founded by Nigel Farage, the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party. At one point this past summer, both parties looked capable of surpassing the Tories, and possibly Labour as well.Since Boris Johnson took the premiership, though, the picture has changed dramatically. The Brexit party has fallen back to 10-12 percent in the polls, while the Tories have surged to the mid-to-high 30s. Moreover, Farage has intimated that he might cooperate with the Tories strategically, targeting constituencies where left-wing Leave voters are concentrated to pull them away from Labour, while staying away from seats that would be contested between the Remain-oriented Liberal Democrats and the Leave-oriented Tories.How could such a strategy work if Brexit is only getting less-popular with time? The answer comes down to intensity and cohesion.If Tory Remain voters -- of which there were many -- cared more about stopping Brexit than they did about the fate of their party, they would defect to the Liberal Democrats, badly damaging the Tories' chances of winning a majority. Similarly, if Labour Remain voters felt that Brexit was the most important issue, they would either have pushed Corbyn to a more decisive Remain stance, or would be working strategically with the Liberal Democrats in the way that the Brexit Party may work with the Tories. And the Liberal Democrats would be doing the same.But while Brexit may be a politically-defining event for the liberal center, for the left this is their first chance at power since the 1970s -- not something to be traded away lightly for the sake of free trade with Germany or even stability in Ireland. Even for liberal centrists, the choice between Corbyn and Johnson may be a tough one. For the right, meanwhile, the party as a whole seems to have come to realize that while the hard Leave voters are a minority in the country, they hold the balance of power within the Tory coalition. If they are not given the wheel, the coach isn't going anywhere.Now they have the wheel, and a Leave coalition looks likely to triumph decisively, in spite of all regrets.What happens then? The opposition could continue to come up with explanations for why the result doesn't truly reflect the will of the people -- blaming the electoral system, for instance (though in current polling the Tory-plus-Brexit coalition outpolls Labour-plus-Lib-Dems by an average of five points, suggesting even proportional representation would give victory to the Brexiteers). But they would be wiser to focus on the future. No longer dependent on the votes of Irish Unionists, nor needing to cater to the concerns of the Scottish Nationalists, a big Tory majority could govern from the center of England rather than Britain.The biggest post-Brexit challenge may not be how to get Britain back into Europe, but how to hold Britain itself together.Want more essential commentary and analysis like this delivered straight to your inbox?

"KGB Judged ‘Comrade V.V. Putin’ a Disciplined, Conscientious Spy","Thu, 31 Oct 2019 06:46:29 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/kgb-judged-comrade-v-v-104629972.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin was “prompt, disciplined and conscientious” as a spy in the KGB, according to a declassified profile from the Soviet Union’s feared security service.“Comrade V.V. Putin constantly improves his ideological and political standards,” according to the document exhibited at the Central State Archive for Historical-Political Documents of St. Petersburg, the Russian leader’s home city. “He’s actively engaged in party education work.”The profile, which is also on show at a Moscow exhibition of “outstanding figures” of modern Russian history, describes Putin as “morally upstanding” and enjoying “well-deserved authority among colleagues,” noting that he won a judo championship in 1978.Putin joined the KGB in 1975 after graduating from the law faculty of Leningrad State University, located in what’s now St. Petersburg, and served as a spy for more than 15 years until the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991. Putin asked to become a KGB officer even before he finished school, according to his Kremlin biography, which cites him saying his view of the organization “was based on idealistic stories I heard about intelligence.”He served in Dresden in East Germany from 1985 until 1990, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel during a largely undistinguished stint, and was awarded a bronze medal for service to the National People’s Army of the German Democratic Republic. He headed the Federal Security Service, the main successor agency of the KGB, in 1998-1999 before President Boris Yeltsin made him prime minister and named Putin as his chosen successor. Putin was elected president in 2000.The KGB’s appraisal of Putin, which appears to be from the late 1970s or early 1980s, was absolutely standard and showed that he hadn’t stood out or achieved anything in particular, according to Alexei Kondaurov, a former KGB general. “Usually we wrote ‘morally upstanding’ when there was nothing else to say,” he said.Still, there’s been “colossal” public interest in the document, shown as part of commemorations of the archive’s 90th anniversary, said Olga Bobrova, deputy head of the institution.To contact the reporters on this story: Irina Reznik in Moscow at ireznik@bloomberg.net;Henry Meyer in Moscow at hmeyer4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Gregory L.

Authorities Identify ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe’ Through DNA and Now the Real Questions Start,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:13:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/authorities-identify-fly-creek-jane-131307745.html,"On a chilly February Sunday in 1980, a father and son panning for gold along Fly Creek in Clark County, Washington, kicked up the remains of a human skeleton that appeared to have been buried in a shallow grave. They called the authorities who came to collect the skull and what bones hadn’t been dragged away by animals, and were able to use the remains to construct a facial reconstruction that produced a picture of a teenage girl. Detectives were able to deduce that she died from a cause that did not seem natural. Calls for information, searches through missing persons reports, and detective work turned up nothing. No one seemed to miss the teen, dubbed the ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe,’ and, for the last 40 years, that is as far as the case went–until now.This summer Clark County detectives decided to post a DNA sample from the old remains to the Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, a public genealogy database that has had recent success closing old cold cases. The lab found a tie to a distant cousin of a teen named Sandra “Sandy” Renee Morden who said she was last seen in 1977–three years before her skeletal remains were found. Courtesy of Clark County SheriffThe Oregonian then dug up an old birthday announcement that was tied to the case. On April 29, 1977, in the classified section of the paper, a tiny ad appeared that said: “Sandra Renee Morden, Happy 15th Birthday. Love Always—Mom.” Such published greetings were a common way to mark a birthday or anniversary in the era before Facebook and other social media. Morden’s parents were divorced, according to the DNA-linked cousin, who does not want to be named and who provided Clark County cold-case detective Lindsay Schultz with the only clues the teen’s life. Schultz told the Oregonian that Morden was a “latchkey kid” who was mostly “unsupervised.” There is no indication that the parents filed a missing persons report, and, as Schultz says, “We didn’t have [the National Crime Information Center] at that time.” The detective says Morden’s parents came from the San Francisco area and settled in Portland. They split up in the early 1970s, and did not communicate with each other. The girl’s mother, identified as Kathryn Irene Morden, apparently lost custody and the cousin said Sandy most often stayed with her father, identified as Andrew Bain Morden, a Marine Corps veteran who fought in the Korean War. Schultz says she likely fell through the cracks when one parent thought the other had her. She last attended Wilson High School in Portland. Schultz told the Oregonian that the father likely thought she was with her mother. He had left her alone for an extended period of time and when he came back, she was gone, so he assumed she had gone to her mother’s home. “We don’t know for certain,” Schultz says. “We know that’s what family members believe.”Both parents are dead, so there is no way to confirm what either of them knew. Schultz told the Oregonian that it is the birthday greeting that bothers him most. It was posted around the time the extended family says she disappeared. “Was it just a mom who loved her daughter–or did her mom know something and put it out there for that reason?” Schultz said. “It’s one of those two, right? You ponder it. You look at it and you think, ‘What does it mean?’”Now detectives are looking for the missing puzzle pieces. They are calling on anyone who might have any information about Morden, her parents, or how she might have died to contact the Clark County Medical Examiner's Office or Clark County Sheriff's Office Cold Case Tip Line.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Why the Tories are cruising toward a big win in Britain,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 05:50:02 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/why-tories-cruising-toward-big-095002680.html,"The polling is clear. Over the more than three years since they voted to leave the European Union, British voters have come to regret their choice. Polls consistently show a several-point margin in favor of Remain, only one in three voters will endorse the proposition that getting Brexit over with is better than further delay, and two thirds believe that a no-deal Brexit should require another referendum.So why are Boris Johnson's Tories, running on a clearer stance for Brexit than ever before, currently projected to win a decisive victory in the December election?The simplest answer is: the opposition is divided. But that answer obscures more than it reveals, because it presumes that the question of Brexit is as dominant among the opposition as it is among the Tories. And the division of the opposition itself proves that this is not the case. On the contrary: Brexit is a truly existential question for a far larger fraction of Leave voters than it is of Remain voters, and that has had and continues to have material electoral consequences.Consider the largest opposition party. Labour under Jeremy Corbin has trended in an overwhelmingly left-wing direction, not only on economic matters but also on immigration and foreign policy. A ""no enemies on the left"" approach has even seen extremist illiberal and anti-Semitic elements gain a greater foothold within the party. But on Brexit, Corbyn has taken a somewhat ambiguous stance, reflecting the fact that while a majority of Labourites voted Remain, a not insignificant number had always been skeptical of an economic arrangement that gave financial interests greater influence at both the national and European levels of government.That combination of stridency and straddle hasn't played well in electoral terms, and has opened space for two other parties to establish themselves as alternatives: the Liberal Democrats, a longstanding centrist liberal party that has positioned itself as the unequivocal party of Remain, and the Brexit Party, a newly-minted political faction founded by Nigel Farage, the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party. At one point this past summer, both parties looked capable of surpassing the Tories, and possibly Labour as well.Since Boris Johnson took the premiership, though, the picture has changed dramatically. The Brexit party has fallen back to 10-12 percent in the polls, while the Tories have surged to the mid-to-high 30s. Moreover, Farage has intimated that he might cooperate with the Tories strategically, targeting constituencies where left-wing Leave voters are concentrated to pull them away from Labour, while staying away from seats that would be contested between the Remain-oriented Liberal Democrats and the Leave-oriented Tories.How could such a strategy work if Brexit is only getting less-popular with time? The answer comes down to intensity and cohesion.If Tory Remain voters -- of which there were many -- cared more about stopping Brexit than they did about the fate of their party, they would defect to the Liberal Democrats, badly damaging the Tories' chances of winning a majority. Similarly, if Labour Remain voters felt that Brexit was the most important issue, they would either have pushed Corbyn to a more decisive Remain stance, or would be working strategically with the Liberal Democrats in the way that the Brexit Party may work with the Tories. And the Liberal Democrats would be doing the same.But while Brexit may be a politically-defining event for the liberal center, for the left this is their first chance at power since the 1970s -- not something to be traded away lightly for the sake of free trade with Germany or even stability in Ireland. Even for liberal centrists, the choice between Corbyn and Johnson may be a tough one. For the right, meanwhile, the party as a whole seems to have come to realize that while the hard Leave voters are a minority in the country, they hold the balance of power within the Tory coalition. If they are not given the wheel, the coach isn't going anywhere.Now they have the wheel, and a Leave coalition looks likely to triumph decisively, in spite of all regrets.What happens then? The opposition could continue to come up with explanations for why the result doesn't truly reflect the will of the people -- blaming the electoral system, for instance (though in current polling the Tory-plus-Brexit coalition outpolls Labour-plus-Lib-Dems by an average of five points, suggesting even proportional representation would give victory to the Brexiteers). But they would be wiser to focus on the future. No longer dependent on the votes of Irish Unionists, nor needing to cater to the concerns of the Scottish Nationalists, a big Tory majority could govern from the center of England rather than Britain.The biggest post-Brexit challenge may not be how to get Britain back into Europe, but how to hold Britain itself together.Want more essential commentary and analysis like this delivered straight to your inbox?

Chris Christie Among Lawyers Making $15 Million in 1MDB Pact,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 12:10:31 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/chris-christie-among-lawyers-reaping-133349408.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest recovery ever from an American anti-corruption crackdown is proving lucrative for former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.A major deal struck by the U.S. for fugitive financier Jho Low to give up almost $1 billion in assets allegedly stolen from a Malaysian investment fund comes with a provision to pay his lawyers. As part of the 1MDB settlement, the Justice Department allowed for $15 million to be paid to a group advising Jho Low, including the law firm Christie set up after two terms as New Jersey’s governor.Those proceeds will come from Jho Low’s stake in EMI Music Publishing, which has grown to about $415 million. That investment ballooned after he initially put in a little more than $100 million stolen from 1MDB, according to prosecutors. The two sides agreed to the provision to allow the lawyers to extract fees from Low, whose assets and accounts have been seized or monitored by authorities across the world.“We were pleased to help negotiate this historic resolution in order to preserve the tremendous value of assets involved,” Christie said in a statement after the Justice Department announced the settlement agreement on Wednesday. It still needs approval from a federal judge.Christie, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 before dropping out and endorsing Donald Trump, set up his own law firm last year, the Christie Law Firm LLC. The other firms that will receive proceeds of the 1MDB deal for legal expenses are Kobre & Kim LLP and Lowenstein Sandler LLP.The agreement comes even before the criminal charges against Low have been resolved. In the settlement, the Justice Department cautioned that the released funds should be used only for the Low family’s legal fees and costs related to the lawsuits, and can’t be routed back to Low or his family.The cases were resolved in a “collaborative and fair way that includes payment of our legal fees,” said Robin Rathmell, a lawyer at Kobre & Kim.(Updates with lawyer’s comment in last paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Sridhar Natarajan in New York at snatarajan15@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

Singh, a convener of the the farmers’ group. Imports of dairy and agricultural products including wheat, cotton and oil seeds would affect the livelihood of millions of Indian farmers, he said.The government should defer signing of the agreement and hold consultations with farmers, state governments and other stake holders before taking a final decision, said Singh. “We have to stop RCEP,” he said.It is not clear yet what terms India will agree to in order to join what could become the world’s largest trade deal. The final stage of negotiations have begun in Bangkok and Indian trade minister Piyush Goyal will travel for the ministerial meeting there on Nov. 1.

Putin constantly improves his ideological and political standards,” according to the document exhibited at the Central State Archive for Historical-Political Documents of St. Petersburg, the Russian leader’s home city. “He’s actively engaged in party education work.”The profile, which is also on show at a Moscow exhibition of “outstanding figures” of modern Russian history, describes Putin as “morally upstanding” and enjoying “well-deserved authority among colleagues,” noting that he won a judo championship in 1978.Putin joined the KGB in 1975 after graduating from the law faculty of Leningrad State University, located in what’s now St. Petersburg, and served as a spy for more than 15 years until the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991.

Authorities Identify ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe’ Through DNA and Now the Real Questions Start,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:13:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/authorities-identify-fly-creek-jane-131307745.html,"On a chilly February Sunday in 1980, a father and son panning for gold along Fly Creek in Clark County, Washington, kicked up the remains of a human skeleton that appeared to have been buried in a shallow grave. They called the authorities who came to collect the skull and what bones hadn’t been dragged away by animals, and were able to use the remains to construct a facial reconstruction that produced a picture of a teenage girl. Detectives were able to deduce that she died from a cause that did not seem natural. Calls for information, searches through missing persons reports, and detective work turned up nothing. No one seemed to miss the teen, dubbed the ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe,’ and, for the last 40 years, that is as far as the case went–until now.This summer Clark County detectives decided to post a DNA sample from the old remains to the Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, a public genealogy database that has had recent success closing old cold cases. The lab found a tie to a distant cousin of a teen named Sandra “Sandy” Renee Morden who said she was last seen in 1977–three years before her skeletal remains were found. Courtesy of Clark County SheriffThe Oregonian then dug up an old birthday announcement that was tied to the case. On April 29, 1977, in the classified section of the paper, a tiny ad appeared that said: “Sandra Renee Morden, Happy 15th Birthday. Love Always—Mom.” Such published greetings were a common way to mark a birthday or anniversary in the era before Facebook and other social media. Morden’s parents were divorced, according to the DNA-linked cousin, who does not want to be named and who provided Clark County cold-case detective Lindsay Schultz with the only clues the teen’s life. Schultz told the Oregonian that Morden was a “latchkey kid” who was mostly “unsupervised.” There is no indication that the parents filed a missing persons report, and, as Schultz says, “We didn’t have [the National Crime Information Center] at that time.” The detective says Morden’s parents came from the San Francisco area and settled in Portland. They split up in the early 1970s, and did not communicate with each other. The girl’s mother, identified as Kathryn Irene Morden, apparently lost custody and the cousin said Sandy most often stayed with her father, identified as Andrew Bain Morden, a Marine Corps veteran who fought in the Korean War. Schultz says she likely fell through the cracks when one parent thought the other had her. She last attended Wilson High School in Portland. Schultz told the Oregonian that the father likely thought she was with her mother. He had left her alone for an extended period of time and when he came back, she was gone, so he assumed she had gone to her mother’s home. “We don’t know for certain,” Schultz says. “We know that’s what family members believe.”Both parents are dead, so there is no way to confirm what either of them knew. Schultz told the Oregonian that it is the birthday greeting that bothers him most. It was posted around the time the extended family says she disappeared. “Was it just a mom who loved her daughter–or did her mom know something and put it out there for that reason?” Schultz said. “It’s one of those two, right? You ponder it. You look at it and you think, ‘What does it mean?’”Now detectives are looking for the missing puzzle pieces. They are calling on anyone who might have any information about Morden, her parents, or how she might have died to contact the Clark County Medical Examiner's Office or Clark County Sheriff's Office Cold Case Tip Line.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Why the Tories are cruising toward a big win in Britain,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 05:50:02 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/why-tories-cruising-toward-big-095002680.html,"The polling is clear. Over the more than three years since they voted to leave the European Union, British voters have come to regret their choice. Polls consistently show a several-point margin in favor of Remain, only one in three voters will endorse the proposition that getting Brexit over with is better than further delay, and two thirds believe that a no-deal Brexit should require another referendum.So why are Boris Johnson's Tories, running on a clearer stance for Brexit than ever before, currently projected to win a decisive victory in the December election?The simplest answer is: the opposition is divided. But that answer obscures more than it reveals, because it presumes that the question of Brexit is as dominant among the opposition as it is among the Tories. And the division of the opposition itself proves that this is not the case. On the contrary: Brexit is a truly existential question for a far larger fraction of Leave voters than it is of Remain voters, and that has had and continues to have material electoral consequences.Consider the largest opposition party. Labour under Jeremy Corbin has trended in an overwhelmingly left-wing direction, not only on economic matters but also on immigration and foreign policy. A ""no enemies on the left"" approach has even seen extremist illiberal and anti-Semitic elements gain a greater foothold within the party. But on Brexit, Corbyn has taken a somewhat ambiguous stance, reflecting the fact that while a majority of Labourites voted Remain, a not insignificant number had always been skeptical of an economic arrangement that gave financial interests greater influence at both the national and European levels of government.That combination of stridency and straddle hasn't played well in electoral terms, and has opened space for two other parties to establish themselves as alternatives: the Liberal Democrats, a longstanding centrist liberal party that has positioned itself as the unequivocal party of Remain, and the Brexit Party, a newly-minted political faction founded by Nigel Farage, the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party. At one point this past summer, both parties looked capable of surpassing the Tories, and possibly Labour as well.Since Boris Johnson took the premiership, though, the picture has changed dramatically. The Brexit party has fallen back to 10-12 percent in the polls, while the Tories have surged to the mid-to-high 30s. Moreover, Farage has intimated that he might cooperate with the Tories strategically, targeting constituencies where left-wing Leave voters are concentrated to pull them away from Labour, while staying away from seats that would be contested between the Remain-oriented Liberal Democrats and the Leave-oriented Tories.How could such a strategy work if Brexit is only getting less-popular with time? The answer comes down to intensity and cohesion.If Tory Remain voters -- of which there were many -- cared more about stopping Brexit than they did about the fate of their party, they would defect to the Liberal Democrats, badly damaging the Tories' chances of winning a majority. Similarly, if Labour Remain voters felt that Brexit was the most important issue, they would either have pushed Corbyn to a more decisive Remain stance, or would be working strategically with the Liberal Democrats in the way that the Brexit Party may work with the Tories. And the Liberal Democrats would be doing the same.But while Brexit may be a politically-defining event for the liberal center, for the left this is their first chance at power since the 1970s -- not something to be traded away lightly for the sake of free trade with Germany or even stability in Ireland. Even for liberal centrists, the choice between Corbyn and Johnson may be a tough one. For the right, meanwhile, the party as a whole seems to have come to realize that while the hard Leave voters are a minority in the country, they hold the balance of power within the Tory coalition. If they are not given the wheel, the coach isn't going anywhere.Now they have the wheel, and a Leave coalition looks likely to triumph decisively, in spite of all regrets.What happens then? The opposition could continue to come up with explanations for why the result doesn't truly reflect the will of the people -- blaming the electoral system, for instance (though in current polling the Tory-plus-Brexit coalition outpolls Labour-plus-Lib-Dems by an average of five points, suggesting even proportional representation would give victory to the Brexiteers). But they would be wiser to focus on the future. No longer dependent on the votes of Irish Unionists, nor needing to cater to the concerns of the Scottish Nationalists, a big Tory majority could govern from the center of England rather than Britain.The biggest post-Brexit challenge may not be how to get Britain back into Europe, but how to hold Britain itself together.Want more essential commentary and analysis like this delivered straight to your inbox?

Chris Christie Among Lawyers Making $15 Million in 1MDB Pact,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 12:10:31 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/chris-christie-among-lawyers-reaping-133349408.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest recovery ever from an American anti-corruption crackdown is proving lucrative for former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.A major deal struck by the U.S. for fugitive financier Jho Low to give up almost $1 billion in assets allegedly stolen from a Malaysian investment fund comes with a provision to pay his lawyers. As part of the 1MDB settlement, the Justice Department allowed for $15 million to be paid to a group advising Jho Low, including the law firm Christie set up after two terms as New Jersey’s governor.Those proceeds will come from Jho Low’s stake in EMI Music Publishing, which has grown to about $415 million. That investment ballooned after he initially put in a little more than $100 million stolen from 1MDB, according to prosecutors. The two sides agreed to the provision to allow the lawyers to extract fees from Low, whose assets and accounts have been seized or monitored by authorities across the world.“We were pleased to help negotiate this historic resolution in order to preserve the tremendous value of assets involved,” Christie said in a statement after the Justice Department announced the settlement agreement on Wednesday. It still needs approval from a federal judge.Christie, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 before dropping out and endorsing Donald Trump, set up his own law firm last year, the Christie Law Firm LLC. The other firms that will receive proceeds of the 1MDB deal for legal expenses are Kobre & Kim LLP and Lowenstein Sandler LLP.The agreement comes even before the criminal charges against Low have been resolved. In the settlement, the Justice Department cautioned that the released funds should be used only for the Low family’s legal fees and costs related to the lawsuits, and can’t be routed back to Low or his family.The cases were resolved in a “collaborative and fair way that includes payment of our legal fees,” said Robin Rathmell, a lawyer at Kobre & Kim.(Updates with lawyer’s comment in last paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Sridhar Natarajan in New York at snatarajan15@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

Sign up here. India’s farmers’ organizations have planned a nationwide protest on Nov. 4 to demand that the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi keep agriculture out of a 16-nation trade agreement currently being negotiated in Thailand.The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, an umbrella organization of about 250 farmers unions from across the country, said that they will burn effigies depicting the China-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership or RCEP, to mark their protest and warn the government.Indian farmers won’t be able to compete should the country agree to cut duties for agricultural and dairy products in the proposed trade pact, said V.M. Singh, a convener of the the farmers’ group. Imports of dairy and agricultural products including wheat, cotton and oil seeds would affect the livelihood of millions of Indian farmers, he said.The government should defer signing of the agreement and hold consultations with farmers, state governments and other stake holders before taking a final decision, said Singh. “We have to stop RCEP,” he said.It is not clear yet what terms India will agree to in order to join what could become the world’s largest trade deal. The final stage of negotiations have begun in Bangkok and Indian trade minister Piyush Goyal will travel for the ministerial meeting there on Nov. 1. The nations are seeking to conclude the negotiations by November end.To contact the reporter on this story: Bibhudatta Pradhan in New Delhi at bpradhan@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ruth Pollard at rpollard2@bloomberg.net, Muneeza Naqvi, Abhay SinghFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GF2o4tZmPCtqpE8IuBOemg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/38b9b9b23d04b76ac5ea78347d209b84,India Farmers Plan Nationwide Protest Against 16-Nation Trade Deal

"KGB Judged ‘Comrade V.V. Putin’ a Disciplined, Conscientious Spy","Thu, 31 Oct 2019 06:46:29 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/kgb-judged-comrade-v-v-104629972.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin was “prompt, disciplined and conscientious” as a spy in the KGB, according to a declassified profile from the Soviet Union’s feared security service.“Comrade V.V. Putin constantly improves his ideological and political standards,” according to the document exhibited at the Central State Archive for Historical-Political Documents of St. Petersburg, the Russian leader’s home city. “He’s actively engaged in party education work.”The profile, which is also on show at a Moscow exhibition of “outstanding figures” of modern Russian history, describes Putin as “morally upstanding” and enjoying “well-deserved authority among colleagues,” noting that he won a judo championship in 1978.Putin joined the KGB in 1975 after graduating from the law faculty of Leningrad State University, located in what’s now St. Petersburg, and served as a spy for more than 15 years until the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991. Putin asked to become a KGB officer even before he finished school, according to his Kremlin biography, which cites him saying his view of the organization “was based on idealistic stories I heard about intelligence.”He served in Dresden in East Germany from 1985 until 1990, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel during a largely undistinguished stint, and was awarded a bronze medal for service to the National People’s Army of the German Democratic Republic. He headed the Federal Security Service, the main successor agency of the KGB, in 1998-1999 before President Boris Yeltsin made him prime minister and named Putin as his chosen successor. Putin was elected president in 2000.The KGB’s appraisal of Putin, which appears to be from the late 1970s or early 1980s, was absolutely standard and showed that he hadn’t stood out or achieved anything in particular, according to Alexei Kondaurov, a former KGB general. “Usually we wrote ‘morally upstanding’ when there was nothing else to say,” he said.Still, there’s been “colossal” public interest in the document, shown as part of commemorations of the archive’s 90th anniversary, said Olga Bobrova, deputy head of the institution.To contact the reporters on this story: Irina Reznik in Moscow at ireznik@bloomberg.net;Henry Meyer in Moscow at hmeyer4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Gregory L.

Why the Tories are cruising toward a big win in Britain,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 05:50:02 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/why-tories-cruising-toward-big-095002680.html,"The polling is clear. Over the more than three years since they voted to leave the European Union, British voters have come to regret their choice. Polls consistently show a several-point margin in favor of Remain, only one in three voters will endorse the proposition that getting Brexit over with is better than further delay, and two thirds believe that a no-deal Brexit should require another referendum.So why are Boris Johnson's Tories, running on a clearer stance for Brexit than ever before, currently projected to win a decisive victory in the December election?The simplest answer is: the opposition is divided. But that answer obscures more than it reveals, because it presumes that the question of Brexit is as dominant among the opposition as it is among the Tories. And the division of the opposition itself proves that this is not the case. On the contrary: Brexit is a truly existential question for a far larger fraction of Leave voters than it is of Remain voters, and that has had and continues to have material electoral consequences.Consider the largest opposition party. Labour under Jeremy Corbin has trended in an overwhelmingly left-wing direction, not only on economic matters but also on immigration and foreign policy. A ""no enemies on the left"" approach has even seen extremist illiberal and anti-Semitic elements gain a greater foothold within the party. But on Brexit, Corbyn has taken a somewhat ambiguous stance, reflecting the fact that while a majority of Labourites voted Remain, a not insignificant number had always been skeptical of an economic arrangement that gave financial interests greater influence at both the national and European levels of government.That combination of stridency and straddle hasn't played well in electoral terms, and has opened space for two other parties to establish themselves as alternatives: the Liberal Democrats, a longstanding centrist liberal party that has positioned itself as the unequivocal party of Remain, and the Brexit Party, a newly-minted political faction founded by Nigel Farage, the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party. At one point this past summer, both parties looked capable of surpassing the Tories, and possibly Labour as well.Since Boris Johnson took the premiership, though, the picture has changed dramatically. The Brexit party has fallen back to 10-12 percent in the polls, while the Tories have surged to the mid-to-high 30s. Moreover, Farage has intimated that he might cooperate with the Tories strategically, targeting constituencies where left-wing Leave voters are concentrated to pull them away from Labour, while staying away from seats that would be contested between the Remain-oriented Liberal Democrats and the Leave-oriented Tories.How could such a strategy work if Brexit is only getting less-popular with time? The answer comes down to intensity and cohesion.If Tory Remain voters -- of which there were many -- cared more about stopping Brexit than they did about the fate of their party, they would defect to the Liberal Democrats, badly damaging the Tories' chances of winning a majority. Similarly, if Labour Remain voters felt that Brexit was the most important issue, they would either have pushed Corbyn to a more decisive Remain stance, or would be working strategically with the Liberal Democrats in the way that the Brexit Party may work with the Tories. And the Liberal Democrats would be doing the same.But while Brexit may be a politically-defining event for the liberal center, for the left this is their first chance at power since the 1970s -- not something to be traded away lightly for the sake of free trade with Germany or even stability in Ireland. Even for liberal centrists, the choice between Corbyn and Johnson may be a tough one. For the right, meanwhile, the party as a whole seems to have come to realize that while the hard Leave voters are a minority in the country, they hold the balance of power within the Tory coalition. If they are not given the wheel, the coach isn't going anywhere.Now they have the wheel, and a Leave coalition looks likely to triumph decisively, in spite of all regrets.What happens then? The opposition could continue to come up with explanations for why the result doesn't truly reflect the will of the people -- blaming the electoral system, for instance (though in current polling the Tory-plus-Brexit coalition outpolls Labour-plus-Lib-Dems by an average of five points, suggesting even proportional representation would give victory to the Brexiteers). But they would be wiser to focus on the future. No longer dependent on the votes of Irish Unionists, nor needing to cater to the concerns of the Scottish Nationalists, a big Tory majority could govern from the center of England rather than Britain.The biggest post-Brexit challenge may not be how to get Britain back into Europe, but how to hold Britain itself together.Want more essential commentary and analysis like this delivered straight to your inbox?

Chris Christie Among Lawyers Making $15 Million in 1MDB Pact,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 12:10:31 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/chris-christie-among-lawyers-reaping-133349408.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest recovery ever from an American anti-corruption crackdown is proving lucrative for former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.A major deal struck by the U.S. for fugitive financier Jho Low to give up almost $1 billion in assets allegedly stolen from a Malaysian investment fund comes with a provision to pay his lawyers. As part of the 1MDB settlement, the Justice Department allowed for $15 million to be paid to a group advising Jho Low, including the law firm Christie set up after two terms as New Jersey’s governor.Those proceeds will come from Jho Low’s stake in EMI Music Publishing, which has grown to about $415 million. That investment ballooned after he initially put in a little more than $100 million stolen from 1MDB, according to prosecutors. The two sides agreed to the provision to allow the lawyers to extract fees from Low, whose assets and accounts have been seized or monitored by authorities across the world.“We were pleased to help negotiate this historic resolution in order to preserve the tremendous value of assets involved,” Christie said in a statement after the Justice Department announced the settlement agreement on Wednesday. It still needs approval from a federal judge.Christie, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 before dropping out and endorsing Donald Trump, set up his own law firm last year, the Christie Law Firm LLC. The other firms that will receive proceeds of the 1MDB deal for legal expenses are Kobre & Kim LLP and Lowenstein Sandler LLP.The agreement comes even before the criminal charges against Low have been resolved. In the settlement, the Justice Department cautioned that the released funds should be used only for the Low family’s legal fees and costs related to the lawsuits, and can’t be routed back to Low or his family.The cases were resolved in a “collaborative and fair way that includes payment of our legal fees,” said Robin Rathmell, a lawyer at Kobre & Kim.(Updates with lawyer’s comment in last paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Sridhar Natarajan in New York at snatarajan15@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

Sign up here. India’s farmers’ organizations have planned a nationwide protest on Nov. 4 to demand that the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi keep agriculture out of a 16-nation trade agreement currently being negotiated in Thailand.The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, an umbrella organization of about 250 farmers unions from across the country, said that they will burn effigies depicting the China-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership or RCEP, to mark their protest and warn the government.Indian farmers won’t be able to compete should the country agree to cut duties for agricultural and dairy products in the proposed trade pact, said V.M. Singh, a convener of the the farmers’ group. Imports of dairy and agricultural products including wheat, cotton and oil seeds would affect the livelihood of millions of Indian farmers, he said.The government should defer signing of the agreement and hold consultations with farmers, state governments and other stake holders before taking a final decision, said Singh. “We have to stop RCEP,” he said.It is not clear yet what terms India will agree to in order to join what could become the world’s largest trade deal. The final stage of negotiations have begun in Bangkok and Indian trade minister Piyush Goyal will travel for the ministerial meeting there on Nov. 1. The nations are seeking to conclude the negotiations by November end.To contact the reporter on this story: Bibhudatta Pradhan in New Delhi at bpradhan@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ruth Pollard at rpollard2@bloomberg.net, Muneeza Naqvi, Abhay SinghFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GF2o4tZmPCtqpE8IuBOemg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/38b9b9b23d04b76ac5ea78347d209b84,India Farmers Plan Nationwide Protest Against 16-Nation Trade Deal
Authorities Identify ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe’ Through DNA and Now the Real Questions Start,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:13:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/authorities-identify-fly-creek-jane-131307745.html,"On a chilly February Sunday in 1980, a father and son panning for gold along Fly Creek in Clark County, Washington, kicked up the remains of a human skeleton that appeared to have been buried in a shallow grave. They called the authorities who came to collect the skull and what bones hadn’t been dragged away by animals, and were able to use the remains to construct a facial reconstruction that produced a picture of a teenage girl. Detectives were able to deduce that she died from a cause that did not seem natural. Calls for information, searches through missing persons reports, and detective work turned up nothing. No one seemed to miss the teen, dubbed the ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe,’ and, for the last 40 years, that is as far as the case went–until now.This summer Clark County detectives decided to post a DNA sample from the old remains to the Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, a public genealogy database that has had recent success closing old cold cases. The lab found a tie to a distant cousin of a teen named Sandra “Sandy” Renee Morden who said she was last seen in 1977–three years before her skeletal remains were found. Courtesy of Clark County SheriffThe Oregonian then dug up an old birthday announcement that was tied to the case. On April 29, 1977, in the classified section of the paper, a tiny ad appeared that said: “Sandra Renee Morden, Happy 15th Birthday. Love Always—Mom.” Such published greetings were a common way to mark a birthday or anniversary in the era before Facebook and other social media. Morden’s parents were divorced, according to the DNA-linked cousin, who does not want to be named and who provided Clark County cold-case detective Lindsay Schultz with the only clues the teen’s life. Schultz told the Oregonian that Morden was a “latchkey kid” who was mostly “unsupervised.” There is no indication that the parents filed a missing persons report, and, as Schultz says, “We didn’t have [the National Crime Information Center] at that time.” The detective says Morden’s parents came from the San Francisco area and settled in Portland. They split up in the early 1970s, and did not communicate with each other. The girl’s mother, identified as Kathryn Irene Morden, apparently lost custody and the cousin said Sandy most often stayed with her father, identified as Andrew Bain Morden, a Marine Corps veteran who fought in the Korean War. Schultz says she likely fell through the cracks when one parent thought the other had her. She last attended Wilson High School in Portland. Schultz told the Oregonian that the father likely thought she was with her mother. He had left her alone for an extended period of time and when he came back, she was gone, so he assumed she had gone to her mother’s home. “We don’t know for certain,” Schultz says. “We know that’s what family members believe.”Both parents are dead, so there is no way to confirm what either of them knew. Schultz told the Oregonian that it is the birthday greeting that bothers him most. It was posted around the time the extended family says she disappeared. “Was it just a mom who loved her daughter–or did her mom know something and put it out there for that reason?” Schultz said. “It’s one of those two, right? You ponder it. You look at it and you think, ‘What does it mean?’”Now detectives are looking for the missing puzzle pieces. They are calling on anyone who might have any information about Morden, her parents, or how she might have died to contact the Clark County Medical Examiner's Office or Clark County Sheriff's Office Cold Case Tip Line.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

"KGB Judged ‘Comrade V.V.

Putin constantly improves his ideological and political standards,” according to the document exhibited at the Central State Archive for Historical-Political Documents of St. Petersburg, the Russian leader’s home city. “He’s actively engaged in party education work.”The profile, which is also on show at a Moscow exhibition of “outstanding figures” of modern Russian history, describes Putin as “morally upstanding” and enjoying “well-deserved authority among colleagues,” noting that he won a judo championship in 1978.Putin joined the KGB in 1975 after graduating from the law faculty of Leningrad State University, located in what’s now St. Petersburg, and served as a spy for more than 15 years until the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991. Putin asked to become a KGB officer even before he finished school, according to his Kremlin biography, which cites him saying his view of the organization “was based on idealistic stories I heard about intelligence.”He served in Dresden in East Germany from 1985 until 1990, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel during a largely undistinguished stint, and was awarded a bronze medal for service to the National People’s Army of the German Democratic Republic. He headed the Federal Security Service, the main successor agency of the KGB, in 1998-1999 before President Boris Yeltsin made him prime minister and named Putin as his chosen successor. Putin was elected president in 2000.The KGB’s appraisal of Putin, which appears to be from the late 1970s or early 1980s, was absolutely standard and showed that he hadn’t stood out or achieved anything in particular, according to Alexei Kondaurov, a former KGB general. “Usually we wrote ‘morally upstanding’ when there was nothing else to say,” he said.Still, there’s been “colossal” public interest in the document, shown as part of commemorations of the archive’s 90th anniversary, said Olga Bobrova, deputy head of the institution.To contact the reporters on this story: Irina Reznik in Moscow at ireznik@bloomberg.net;Henry Meyer in Moscow at hmeyer4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Gregory L.

At one point this past summer, both parties looked capable of surpassing the Tories, and possibly Labour as well.Since Boris Johnson took the premiership, though, the picture has changed dramatically. The Brexit party has fallen back to 10-12 percent in the polls, while the Tories have surged to the mid-to-high 30s. Moreover, Farage has intimated that he might cooperate with the Tories strategically, targeting constituencies where left-wing Leave voters are concentrated to pull them away from Labour, while staying away from seats that would be contested between the Remain-oriented Liberal Democrats and the Leave-oriented Tories.How could such a strategy work if Brexit is only getting less-popular with time? The answer comes down to intensity and cohesion.If Tory Remain voters -- of which there were many -- cared more about stopping Brexit than they did about the fate of their party, they would defect to the Liberal Democrats, badly damaging the Tories' chances of winning a majority. Similarly, if Labour Remain voters felt that Brexit was the most important issue, they would either have pushed Corbyn to a more decisive Remain stance, or would be working strategically with the Liberal Democrats in the way that the Brexit Party may work with the Tories. And the Liberal Democrats would be doing the same.But while Brexit may be a politically-defining event for the liberal center, for the left this is their first chance at power since the 1970s -- not something to be traded away lightly for the sake of free trade with Germany or even stability in Ireland. Even for liberal centrists, the choice between Corbyn and Johnson may be a tough one. For the right, meanwhile, the party as a whole seems to have come to realize that while the hard Leave voters are a minority in the country, they hold the balance of power within the Tory coalition. If they are not given the wheel, the coach isn't going anywhere.Now they have the wheel, and a Leave coalition looks likely to triumph decisively, in spite of all regrets.What happens then? The opposition could continue to come up with explanations for why the result doesn't truly reflect the will of the people -- blaming the electoral system, for instance (though in current polling the Tory-plus-Brexit coalition outpolls Labour-plus-Lib-Dems by an average of five points, suggesting even proportional representation would give victory to the Brexiteers). But they would be wiser to focus on the future. No longer dependent on the votes of Irish Unionists, nor needing to cater to the concerns of the Scottish Nationalists, a big Tory majority could govern from the center of England rather than Britain.The biggest post-Brexit challenge may not be how to get Britain back into Europe, but how to hold Britain itself together.Want more essential commentary and analysis like this delivered straight to your inbox?

Chris Christie Among Lawyers Making $15 Million in 1MDB Pact,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 12:10:31 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/chris-christie-among-lawyers-reaping-133349408.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest recovery ever from an American anti-corruption crackdown is proving lucrative for former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.A major deal struck by the U.S. for fugitive financier Jho Low to give up almost $1 billion in assets allegedly stolen from a Malaysian investment fund comes with a provision to pay his lawyers. As part of the 1MDB settlement, the Justice Department allowed for $15 million to be paid to a group advising Jho Low, including the law firm Christie set up after two terms as New Jersey’s governor.Those proceeds will come from Jho Low’s stake in EMI Music Publishing, which has grown to about $415 million. That investment ballooned after he initially put in a little more than $100 million stolen from 1MDB, according to prosecutors. The two sides agreed to the provision to allow the lawyers to extract fees from Low, whose assets and accounts have been seized or monitored by authorities across the world.“We were pleased to help negotiate this historic resolution in order to preserve the tremendous value of assets involved,” Christie said in a statement after the Justice Department announced the settlement agreement on Wednesday. It still needs approval from a federal judge.Christie, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 before dropping out and endorsing Donald Trump, set up his own law firm last year, the Christie Law Firm LLC. The other firms that will receive proceeds of the 1MDB deal for legal expenses are Kobre & Kim LLP and Lowenstein Sandler LLP.The agreement comes even before the criminal charges against Low have been resolved. In the settlement, the Justice Department cautioned that the released funds should be used only for the Low family’s legal fees and costs related to the lawsuits, and can’t be routed back to Low or his family.The cases were resolved in a “collaborative and fair way that includes payment of our legal fees,” said Robin Rathmell, a lawyer at Kobre & Kim.(Updates with lawyer’s comment in last paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Sridhar Natarajan in New York at snatarajan15@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

Sign up here. India’s farmers’ organizations have planned a nationwide protest on Nov. 4 to demand that the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi keep agriculture out of a 16-nation trade agreement currently being negotiated in Thailand.The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, an umbrella organization of about 250 farmers unions from across the country, said that they will burn effigies depicting the China-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership or RCEP, to mark their protest and warn the government.Indian farmers won’t be able to compete should the country agree to cut duties for agricultural and dairy products in the proposed trade pact, said V.M. Singh, a convener of the the farmers’ group. Imports of dairy and agricultural products including wheat, cotton and oil seeds would affect the livelihood of millions of Indian farmers, he said.The government should defer signing of the agreement and hold consultations with farmers, state governments and other stake holders before taking a final decision, said Singh. “We have to stop RCEP,” he said.It is not clear yet what terms India will agree to in order to join what could become the world’s largest trade deal. The final stage of negotiations have begun in Bangkok and Indian trade minister Piyush Goyal will travel for the ministerial meeting there on Nov. 1. The nations are seeking to conclude the negotiations by November end.To contact the reporter on this story: Bibhudatta Pradhan in New Delhi at bpradhan@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ruth Pollard at rpollard2@bloomberg.net, Muneeza Naqvi, Abhay SinghFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GF2o4tZmPCtqpE8IuBOemg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/38b9b9b23d04b76ac5ea78347d209b84,India Farmers Plan Nationwide Protest Against 16-Nation Trade Deal
Authorities Identify ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe’ Through DNA and Now the Real Questions Start,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:13:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/authorities-identify-fly-creek-jane-131307745.html,"On a chilly February Sunday in 1980, a father and son panning for gold along Fly Creek in Clark County, Washington, kicked up the remains of a human skeleton that appeared to have been buried in a shallow grave. They called the authorities who came to collect the skull and what bones hadn’t been dragged away by animals, and were able to use the remains to construct a facial reconstruction that produced a picture of a teenage girl. Detectives were able to deduce that she died from a cause that did not seem natural. Calls for information, searches through missing persons reports, and detective work turned up nothing. No one seemed to miss the teen, dubbed the ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe,’ and, for the last 40 years, that is as far as the case went–until now.This summer Clark County detectives decided to post a DNA sample from the old remains to the Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, a public genealogy database that has had recent success closing old cold cases. The lab found a tie to a distant cousin of a teen named Sandra “Sandy” Renee Morden who said she was last seen in 1977–three years before her skeletal remains were found. Courtesy of Clark County SheriffThe Oregonian then dug up an old birthday announcement that was tied to the case. On April 29, 1977, in the classified section of the paper, a tiny ad appeared that said: “Sandra Renee Morden, Happy 15th Birthday. Love Always—Mom.” Such published greetings were a common way to mark a birthday or anniversary in the era before Facebook and other social media. Morden’s parents were divorced, according to the DNA-linked cousin, who does not want to be named and who provided Clark County cold-case detective Lindsay Schultz with the only clues the teen’s life. Schultz told the Oregonian that Morden was a “latchkey kid” who was mostly “unsupervised.” There is no indication that the parents filed a missing persons report, and, as Schultz says, “We didn’t have [the National Crime Information Center] at that time.” The detective says Morden’s parents came from the San Francisco area and settled in Portland. They split up in the early 1970s, and did not communicate with each other. The girl’s mother, identified as Kathryn Irene Morden, apparently lost custody and the cousin said Sandy most often stayed with her father, identified as Andrew Bain Morden, a Marine Corps veteran who fought in the Korean War. Schultz says she likely fell through the cracks when one parent thought the other had her. She last attended Wilson High School in Portland. Schultz told the Oregonian that the father likely thought she was with her mother. He had left her alone for an extended period of time and when he came back, she was gone, so he assumed she had gone to her mother’s home. “We don’t know for certain,” Schultz says. “We know that’s what family members believe.”Both parents are dead, so there is no way to confirm what either of them knew. Schultz told the Oregonian that it is the birthday greeting that bothers him most. It was posted around the time the extended family says she disappeared. “Was it just a mom who loved her daughter–or did her mom know something and put it out there for that reason?” Schultz said. “It’s one of those two, right? You ponder it. You look at it and you think, ‘What does it mean?’”Now detectives are looking for the missing puzzle pieces. They are calling on anyone who might have any information about Morden, her parents, or how she might have died to contact the Clark County Medical Examiner's Office or Clark County Sheriff's Office Cold Case Tip Line.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

"KGB Judged ‘Comrade V.V. Putin’ a Disciplined, Conscientious Spy","Thu, 31 Oct 2019 06:46:29 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/kgb-judged-comrade-v-v-104629972.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin was “prompt, disciplined and conscientious” as a spy in the KGB, according to a declassified profile from the Soviet Union’s feared security service.“Comrade V.V. Putin constantly improves his ideological and political standards,” according to the document exhibited at the Central State Archive for Historical-Political Documents of St. Petersburg, the Russian leader’s home city. “He’s actively engaged in party education work.”The profile, which is also on show at a Moscow exhibition of “outstanding figures” of modern Russian history, describes Putin as “morally upstanding” and enjoying “well-deserved authority among colleagues,” noting that he won a judo championship in 1978.Putin joined the KGB in 1975 after graduating from the law faculty of Leningrad State University, located in what’s now St. Petersburg, and served as a spy for more than 15 years until the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991. Putin asked to become a KGB officer even before he finished school, according to his Kremlin biography, which cites him saying his view of the organization “was based on idealistic stories I heard about intelligence.”He served in Dresden in East Germany from 1985 until 1990, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel during a largely undistinguished stint, and was awarded a bronze medal for service to the National People’s Army of the German Democratic Republic. He headed the Federal Security Service, the main successor agency of the KGB, in 1998-1999 before President Boris Yeltsin made him prime minister and named Putin as his chosen successor. Putin was elected president in 2000.The KGB’s appraisal of Putin, which appears to be from the late 1970s or early 1980s, was absolutely standard and showed that he hadn’t stood out or achieved anything in particular, according to Alexei Kondaurov, a former KGB general. “Usually we wrote ‘morally upstanding’ when there was nothing else to say,” he said.Still, there’s been “colossal” public interest in the document, shown as part of commemorations of the archive’s 90th anniversary, said Olga Bobrova, deputy head of the institution.To contact the reporters on this story: Irina Reznik in Moscow at ireznik@bloomberg.net;Henry Meyer in Moscow at hmeyer4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Gregory L.

Why the Tories are cruising toward a big win in Britain,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 05:50:02 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/why-tories-cruising-toward-big-095002680.html,"The polling is clear. Over the more than three years since they voted to leave the European Union, British voters have come to regret their choice. Polls consistently show a several-point margin in favor of Remain, only one in three voters will endorse the proposition that getting Brexit over with is better than further delay, and two thirds believe that a no-deal Brexit should require another referendum.So why are Boris Johnson's Tories, running on a clearer stance for Brexit than ever before, currently projected to win a decisive victory in the December election?The simplest answer is: the opposition is divided. But that answer obscures more than it reveals, because it presumes that the question of Brexit is as dominant among the opposition as it is among the Tories. And the division of the opposition itself proves that this is not the case. On the contrary: Brexit is a truly existential question for a far larger fraction of Leave voters than it is of Remain voters, and that has had and continues to have material electoral consequences.Consider the largest opposition party. Labour under Jeremy Corbin has trended in an overwhelmingly left-wing direction, not only on economic matters but also on immigration and foreign policy. A ""no enemies on the left"" approach has even seen extremist illiberal and anti-Semitic elements gain a greater foothold within the party. But on Brexit, Corbyn has taken a somewhat ambiguous stance, reflecting the fact that while a majority of Labourites voted Remain, a not insignificant number had always been skeptical of an economic arrangement that gave financial interests greater influence at both the national and European levels of government.That combination of stridency and straddle hasn't played well in electoral terms, and has opened space for two other parties to establish themselves as alternatives: the Liberal Democrats, a longstanding centrist liberal party that has positioned itself as the unequivocal party of Remain, and the Brexit Party, a newly-minted political faction founded by Nigel Farage, the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party. At one point this past summer, both parties looked capable of surpassing the Tories, and possibly Labour as well.Since Boris Johnson took the premiership, though, the picture has changed dramatically. The Brexit party has fallen back to 10-12 percent in the polls, while the Tories have surged to the mid-to-high 30s. Moreover, Farage has intimated that he might cooperate with the Tories strategically, targeting constituencies where left-wing Leave voters are concentrated to pull them away from Labour, while staying away from seats that would be contested between the Remain-oriented Liberal Democrats and the Leave-oriented Tories.How could such a strategy work if Brexit is only getting less-popular with time?

Similarly, if Labour Remain voters felt that Brexit was the most important issue, they would either have pushed Corbyn to a more decisive Remain stance, or would be working strategically with the Liberal Democrats in the way that the Brexit Party may work with the Tories. And the Liberal Democrats would be doing the same.But while Brexit may be a politically-defining event for the liberal center, for the left this is their first chance at power since the 1970s -- not something to be traded away lightly for the sake of free trade with Germany or even stability in Ireland. Even for liberal centrists, the choice between Corbyn and Johnson may be a tough one. For the right, meanwhile, the party as a whole seems to have come to realize that while the hard Leave voters are a minority in the country, they hold the balance of power within the Tory coalition. If they are not given the wheel, the coach isn't going anywhere.Now they have the wheel, and a Leave coalition looks likely to triumph decisively, in spite of all regrets.What happens then?

But they would be wiser to focus on the future. No longer dependent on the votes of Irish Unionists, nor needing to cater to the concerns of the Scottish Nationalists, a big Tory majority could govern from the center of England rather than Britain.The biggest post-Brexit challenge may not be how to get Britain back into Europe, but how to hold Britain itself together.Want more essential commentary and analysis like this delivered straight to your inbox?

As part of the 1MDB settlement, the Justice Department allowed for $15 million to be paid to a group advising Jho Low, including the law firm Christie set up after two terms as New Jersey’s governor.Those proceeds will come from Jho Low’s stake in EMI Music Publishing, which has grown to about $415 million. That investment ballooned after he initially put in a little more than $100 million stolen from 1MDB, according to prosecutors. The two sides agreed to the provision to allow the lawyers to extract fees from Low, whose assets and accounts have been seized or monitored by authorities across the world.“We were pleased to help negotiate this historic resolution in order to preserve the tremendous value of assets involved,” Christie said in a statement after the Justice Department announced the settlement agreement on Wednesday. It still needs approval from a federal judge.Christie, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 before dropping out and endorsing Donald Trump, set up his own law firm last year, the Christie Law Firm LLC. The other firms that will receive proceeds of the 1MDB deal for legal expenses are Kobre & Kim LLP and Lowenstein Sandler LLP.The agreement comes even before the criminal charges against Low have been resolved. In the settlement, the Justice Department cautioned that the released funds should be used only for the Low family’s legal fees and costs related to the lawsuits, and can’t be routed back to Low or his family.The cases were resolved in a “collaborative and fair way that includes payment of our legal fees,” said Robin Rathmell, a lawyer at Kobre & Kim.(Updates with lawyer’s comment in last paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Sridhar Natarajan in New York at snatarajan15@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

Sign up here. India’s farmers’ organizations have planned a nationwide protest on Nov. 4 to demand that the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi keep agriculture out of a 16-nation trade agreement currently being negotiated in Thailand.The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, an umbrella organization of about 250 farmers unions from across the country, said that they will burn effigies depicting the China-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership or RCEP, to mark their protest and warn the government.Indian farmers won’t be able to compete should the country agree to cut duties for agricultural and dairy products in the proposed trade pact, said V.M. Singh, a convener of the the farmers’ group. Imports of dairy and agricultural products including wheat, cotton and oil seeds would affect the livelihood of millions of Indian farmers, he said.The government should defer signing of the agreement and hold consultations with farmers, state governments and other stake holders before taking a final decision, said Singh. “We have to stop RCEP,” he said.It is not clear yet what terms India will agree to in order to join what could become the world’s largest trade deal. The final stage of negotiations have begun in Bangkok and Indian trade minister Piyush Goyal will travel for the ministerial meeting there on Nov. 1. The nations are seeking to conclude the negotiations by November end.To contact the reporter on this story: Bibhudatta Pradhan in New Delhi at bpradhan@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ruth Pollard at rpollard2@bloomberg.net, Muneeza Naqvi, Abhay SinghFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GF2o4tZmPCtqpE8IuBOemg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/38b9b9b23d04b76ac5ea78347d209b84,India Farmers Plan Nationwide Protest Against 16-Nation Trade Deal
Authorities Identify ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe’ Through DNA and Now the Real Questions Start,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:13:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/authorities-identify-fly-creek-jane-131307745.html,"On a chilly February Sunday in 1980, a father and son panning for gold along Fly Creek in Clark County, Washington, kicked up the remains of a human skeleton that appeared to have been buried in a shallow grave. They called the authorities who came to collect the skull and what bones hadn’t been dragged away by animals, and were able to use the remains to construct a facial reconstruction that produced a picture of a teenage girl. Detectives were able to deduce that she died from a cause that did not seem natural. Calls for information, searches through missing persons reports, and detective work turned up nothing. No one seemed to miss the teen, dubbed the ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe,’ and, for the last 40 years, that is as far as the case went–until now.This summer Clark County detectives decided to post a DNA sample from the old remains to the Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, a public genealogy database that has had recent success closing old cold cases. The lab found a tie to a distant cousin of a teen named Sandra “Sandy” Renee Morden who said she was last seen in 1977–three years before her skeletal remains were found. Courtesy of Clark County SheriffThe Oregonian then dug up an old birthday announcement that was tied to the case. On April 29, 1977, in the classified section of the paper, a tiny ad appeared that said: “Sandra Renee Morden, Happy 15th Birthday. Love Always—Mom.” Such published greetings were a common way to mark a birthday or anniversary in the era before Facebook and other social media. Morden’s parents were divorced, according to the DNA-linked cousin, who does not want to be named and who provided Clark County cold-case detective Lindsay Schultz with the only clues the teen’s life. Schultz told the Oregonian that Morden was a “latchkey kid” who was mostly “unsupervised.” There is no indication that the parents filed a missing persons report, and, as Schultz says, “We didn’t have [the National Crime Information Center] at that time.” The detective says Morden’s parents came from the San Francisco area and settled in Portland. They split up in the early 1970s, and did not communicate with each other. The girl’s mother, identified as Kathryn Irene Morden, apparently lost custody and the cousin said Sandy most often stayed with her father, identified as Andrew Bain Morden, a Marine Corps veteran who fought in the Korean War. Schultz says she likely fell through the cracks when one parent thought the other had her. She last attended Wilson High School in Portland. Schultz told the Oregonian that the father likely thought she was with her mother. He had left her alone for an extended period of time and when he came back, she was gone, so he assumed she had gone to her mother’s home. “We don’t know for certain,” Schultz says. “We know that’s what family members believe.”Both parents are dead, so there is no way to confirm what either of them knew. Schultz told the Oregonian that it is the birthday greeting that bothers him most. It was posted around the time the extended family says she disappeared. “Was it just a mom who loved her daughter–or did her mom know something and put it out there for that reason?” Schultz said. “It’s one of those two, right? You ponder it. You look at it and you think, ‘What does it mean?’”Now detectives are looking for the missing puzzle pieces. They are calling on anyone who might have any information about Morden, her parents, or how she might have died to contact the Clark County Medical Examiner's Office or Clark County Sheriff's Office Cold Case Tip Line.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

"KGB Judged ‘Comrade V.V. Putin’ a Disciplined, Conscientious Spy","Thu, 31 Oct 2019 06:46:29 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/kgb-judged-comrade-v-v-104629972.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin was “prompt, disciplined and conscientious” as a spy in the KGB, according to a declassified profile from the Soviet Union’s feared security service.“Comrade V.V. Putin constantly improves his ideological and political standards,” according to the document exhibited at the Central State Archive for Historical-Political Documents of St. Petersburg, the Russian leader’s home city. “He’s actively engaged in party education work.”The profile, which is also on show at a Moscow exhibition of “outstanding figures” of modern Russian history, describes Putin as “morally upstanding” and enjoying “well-deserved authority among colleagues,” noting that he won a judo championship in 1978.Putin joined the KGB in 1975 after graduating from the law faculty of Leningrad State University, located in what’s now St. Petersburg, and served as a spy for more than 15 years until the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991. Putin asked to become a KGB officer even before he finished school, according to his Kremlin biography, which cites him saying his view of the organization “was based on idealistic stories I heard about intelligence.”He served in Dresden in East Germany from 1985 until 1990, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel during a largely undistinguished stint, and was awarded a bronze medal for service to the National People’s Army of the German Democratic Republic. He headed the Federal Security Service, the main successor agency of the KGB, in 1998-1999 before President Boris Yeltsin made him prime minister and named Putin as his chosen successor. Putin was elected president in 2000.The KGB’s appraisal of Putin, which appears to be from the late 1970s or early 1980s, was absolutely standard and showed that he hadn’t stood out or achieved anything in particular, according to Alexei Kondaurov, a former KGB general. “Usually we wrote ‘morally upstanding’ when there was nothing else to say,” he said.Still, there’s been “colossal” public interest in the document, shown as part of commemorations of the archive’s 90th anniversary, said Olga Bobrova, deputy head of the institution.To contact the reporters on this story: Irina Reznik in Moscow at ireznik@bloomberg.net;Henry Meyer in Moscow at hmeyer4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Gregory L.

Why the Tories are cruising toward a big win in Britain,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 05:50:02 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/why-tories-cruising-toward-big-095002680.html,"The polling is clear. Over the more than three years since they voted to leave the European Union, British voters have come to regret their choice. Polls consistently show a several-point margin in favor of Remain, only one in three voters will endorse the proposition that getting Brexit over with is better than further delay, and two thirds believe that a no-deal Brexit should require another referendum.So why are Boris Johnson's Tories, running on a clearer stance for Brexit than ever before, currently projected to win a decisive victory in the December election?The simplest answer is: the opposition is divided. But that answer obscures more than it reveals, because it presumes that the question of Brexit is as dominant among the opposition as it is among the Tories. And the division of the opposition itself proves that this is not the case. On the contrary: Brexit is a truly existential question for a far larger fraction of Leave voters than it is of Remain voters, and that has had and continues to have material electoral consequences.Consider the largest opposition party. Labour under Jeremy Corbin has trended in an overwhelmingly left-wing direction, not only on economic matters but also on immigration and foreign policy. A ""no enemies on the left"" approach has even seen extremist illiberal and anti-Semitic elements gain a greater foothold within the party. But on Brexit, Corbyn has taken a somewhat ambiguous stance, reflecting the fact that while a majority of Labourites voted Remain, a not insignificant number had always been skeptical of an economic arrangement that gave financial interests greater influence at both the national and European levels of government.That combination of stridency and straddle hasn't played well in electoral terms, and has opened space for two other parties to establish themselves as alternatives: the Liberal Democrats, a longstanding centrist liberal party that has positioned itself as the unequivocal party of Remain, and the Brexit Party, a newly-minted political faction founded by Nigel Farage, the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party. At one point this past summer, both parties looked capable of surpassing the Tories, and possibly Labour as well.Since Boris Johnson took the premiership, though, the picture has changed dramatically. The Brexit party has fallen back to 10-12 percent in the polls, while the Tories have surged to the mid-to-high 30s. Moreover, Farage has intimated that he might cooperate with the Tories strategically, targeting constituencies where left-wing Leave voters are concentrated to pull them away from Labour, while staying away from seats that would be contested between the Remain-oriented Liberal Democrats and the Leave-oriented Tories.How could such a strategy work if Brexit is only getting less-popular with time? The answer comes down to intensity and cohesion.If Tory Remain voters -- of which there were many -- cared more about stopping Brexit than they did about the fate of their party, they would defect to the Liberal Democrats, badly damaging the Tories' chances of winning a majority. Similarly, if Labour Remain voters felt that Brexit was the most important issue, they would either have pushed Corbyn to a more decisive Remain stance, or would be working strategically with the Liberal Democrats in the way that the Brexit Party may work with the Tories. And the Liberal Democrats would be doing the same.But while Brexit may be a politically-defining event for the liberal center, for the left this is their first chance at power since the 1970s -- not something to be traded away lightly for the sake of free trade with Germany or even stability in Ireland. Even for liberal centrists, the choice between Corbyn and Johnson may be a tough one. For the right, meanwhile, the party as a whole seems to have come to realize that while the hard Leave voters are a minority in the country, they hold the balance of power within the Tory coalition. If they are not given the wheel, the coach isn't going anywhere.Now they have the wheel, and a Leave coalition looks likely to triumph decisively, in spite of all regrets.What happens then? The opposition could continue to come up with explanations for why the result doesn't truly reflect the will of the people -- blaming the electoral system, for instance (though in current polling the Tory-plus-Brexit coalition outpolls Labour-plus-Lib-Dems by an average of five points, suggesting even proportional representation would give victory to the Brexiteers). But they would be wiser to focus on the future. No longer dependent on the votes of Irish Unionists, nor needing to cater to the concerns of the Scottish Nationalists, a big Tory majority could govern from the center of England rather than Britain.The biggest post-Brexit challenge may not be how to get Britain back into Europe, but how to hold Britain itself together.Want more essential commentary and analysis like this delivered straight to your inbox?

India Farmers Plan Nationwide Protest Against 16-Nation Trade Deal,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 08:50:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/india-farmers-plan-nationwide-protest-125007797.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars. Sign up here. India’s farmers’ organizations have planned a nationwide protest on Nov. 4 to demand that the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi keep agriculture out of a 16-nation trade agreement currently being negotiated in Thailand.The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, an umbrella organization of about 250 farmers unions from across the country, said that they will burn effigies depicting the China-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership or RCEP, to mark their protest and warn the government.Indian farmers won’t be able to compete should the country agree to cut duties for agricultural and dairy products in the proposed trade pact, said V.M. Singh, a convener of the the farmers’ group. Imports of dairy and agricultural products including wheat, cotton and oil seeds would affect the livelihood of millions of Indian farmers, he said.The government should defer signing of the agreement and hold consultations with farmers, state governments and other stake holders before taking a final decision, said Singh. “We have to stop RCEP,” he said.It is not clear yet what terms India will agree to in order to join what could become the world’s largest trade deal. The final stage of negotiations have begun in Bangkok and Indian trade minister Piyush Goyal will travel for the ministerial meeting there on Nov. 1. The nations are seeking to conclude the negotiations by November end.To contact the reporter on this story: Bibhudatta Pradhan in New Delhi at bpradhan@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ruth Pollard at rpollard2@bloomberg.net, Muneeza Naqvi, Abhay SinghFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GF2o4tZmPCtqpE8IuBOemg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/38b9b9b23d04b76ac5ea78347d209b84,India Farmers Plan Nationwide Protest Against 16-Nation Trade Deal
Authorities Identify ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe’ Through DNA and Now the Real Questions Start,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:13:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/authorities-identify-fly-creek-jane-131307745.html,"On a chilly February Sunday in 1980, a father and son panning for gold along Fly Creek in Clark County, Washington, kicked up the remains of a human skeleton that appeared to have been buried in a shallow grave. They called the authorities who came to collect the skull and what bones hadn’t been dragged away by animals, and were able to use the remains to construct a facial reconstruction that produced a picture of a teenage girl. Detectives were able to deduce that she died from a cause that did not seem natural. Calls for information, searches through missing persons reports, and detective work turned up nothing. No one seemed to miss the teen, dubbed the ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe,’ and, for the last 40 years, that is as far as the case went–until now.This summer Clark County detectives decided to post a DNA sample from the old remains to the Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, a public genealogy database that has had recent success closing old cold cases. The lab found a tie to a distant cousin of a teen named Sandra “Sandy” Renee Morden who said she was last seen in 1977–three years before her skeletal remains were found. Courtesy of Clark County SheriffThe Oregonian then dug up an old birthday announcement that was tied to the case. On April 29, 1977, in the classified section of the paper, a tiny ad appeared that said: “Sandra Renee Morden, Happy 15th Birthday. Love Always—Mom.” Such published greetings were a common way to mark a birthday or anniversary in the era before Facebook and other social media. Morden’s parents were divorced, according to the DNA-linked cousin, who does not want to be named and who provided Clark County cold-case detective Lindsay Schultz with the only clues the teen’s life. Schultz told the Oregonian that Morden was a “latchkey kid” who was mostly “unsupervised.” There is no indication that the parents filed a missing persons report, and, as Schultz says, “We didn’t have [the National Crime Information Center] at that time.” The detective says Morden’s parents came from the San Francisco area and settled in Portland. They split up in the early 1970s, and did not communicate with each other. The girl’s mother, identified as Kathryn Irene Morden, apparently lost custody and the cousin said Sandy most often stayed with her father, identified as Andrew Bain Morden, a Marine Corps veteran who fought in the Korean War. Schultz says she likely fell through the cracks when one parent thought the other had her. She last attended Wilson High School in Portland. Schultz told the Oregonian that the father likely thought she was with her mother. He had left her alone for an extended period of time and when he came back, she was gone, so he assumed she had gone to her mother’s home. “We don’t know for certain,” Schultz says. “We know that’s what family members believe.”Both parents are dead, so there is no way to confirm what either of them knew. Schultz told the Oregonian that it is the birthday greeting that bothers him most. It was posted around the time the extended family says she disappeared. “Was it just a mom who loved her daughter–or did her mom know something and put it out there for that reason?” Schultz said. “It’s one of those two, right? You ponder it. You look at it and you think, ‘What does it mean?’”Now detectives are looking for the missing puzzle pieces. They are calling on anyone who might have any information about Morden, her parents, or how she might have died to contact the Clark County Medical Examiner's Office or Clark County Sheriff's Office Cold Case Tip Line.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

"KGB Judged ‘Comrade V.V. Putin’ a Disciplined, Conscientious Spy","Thu, 31 Oct 2019 06:46:29 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/kgb-judged-comrade-v-v-104629972.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin was “prompt, disciplined and conscientious” as a spy in the KGB, according to a declassified profile from the Soviet Union’s feared security service.“Comrade V.V. Putin constantly improves his ideological and political standards,” according to the document exhibited at the Central State Archive for Historical-Political Documents of St. Petersburg, the Russian leader’s home city. “He’s actively engaged in party education work.”The profile, which is also on show at a Moscow exhibition of “outstanding figures” of modern Russian history, describes Putin as “morally upstanding” and enjoying “well-deserved authority among colleagues,” noting that he won a judo championship in 1978.Putin joined the KGB in 1975 after graduating from the law faculty of Leningrad State University, located in what’s now St. Petersburg, and served as a spy for more than 15 years until the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991. Putin asked to become a KGB officer even before he finished school, according to his Kremlin biography, which cites him saying his view of the organization “was based on idealistic stories I heard about intelligence.”He served in Dresden in East Germany from 1985 until 1990, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel during a largely undistinguished stint, and was awarded a bronze medal for service to the National People’s Army of the German Democratic Republic. He headed the Federal Security Service, the main successor agency of the KGB, in 1998-1999 before President Boris Yeltsin made him prime minister and named Putin as his chosen successor. Putin was elected president in 2000.The KGB’s appraisal of Putin, which appears to be from the late 1970s or early 1980s, was absolutely standard and showed that he hadn’t stood out or achieved anything in particular, according to Alexei Kondaurov, a former KGB general. “Usually we wrote ‘morally upstanding’ when there was nothing else to say,” he said.Still, there’s been “colossal” public interest in the document, shown as part of commemorations of the archive’s 90th anniversary, said Olga Bobrova, deputy head of the institution.To contact the reporters on this story: Irina Reznik in Moscow at ireznik@bloomberg.net;Henry Meyer in Moscow at hmeyer4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Gregory L.

Why the Tories are cruising toward a big win in Britain,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 05:50:02 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/why-tories-cruising-toward-big-095002680.html,"The polling is clear. Over the more than three years since they voted to leave the European Union, British voters have come to regret their choice. Polls consistently show a several-point margin in favor of Remain, only one in three voters will endorse the proposition that getting Brexit over with is better than further delay, and two thirds believe that a no-deal Brexit should require another referendum.So why are Boris Johnson's Tories, running on a clearer stance for Brexit than ever before, currently projected to win a decisive victory in the December election?The simplest answer is: the opposition is divided. But that answer obscures more than it reveals, because it presumes that the question of Brexit is as dominant among the opposition as it is among the Tories. And the division of the opposition itself proves that this is not the case. On the contrary: Brexit is a truly existential question for a far larger fraction of Leave voters than it is of Remain voters, and that has had and continues to have material electoral consequences.Consider the largest opposition party. Labour under Jeremy Corbin has trended in an overwhelmingly left-wing direction, not only on economic matters but also on immigration and foreign policy. A ""no enemies on the left"" approach has even seen extremist illiberal and anti-Semitic elements gain a greater foothold within the party. But on Brexit, Corbyn has taken a somewhat ambiguous stance, reflecting the fact that while a majority of Labourites voted Remain, a not insignificant number had always been skeptical of an economic arrangement that gave financial interests greater influence at both the national and European levels of government.That combination of stridency and straddle hasn't played well in electoral terms, and has opened space for two other parties to establish themselves as alternatives: the Liberal Democrats, a longstanding centrist liberal party that has positioned itself as the unequivocal party of Remain, and the Brexit Party, a newly-minted political faction founded by Nigel Farage, the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party. At one point this past summer, both parties looked capable of surpassing the Tories, and possibly Labour as well.Since Boris Johnson took the premiership, though, the picture has changed dramatically. The Brexit party has fallen back to 10-12 percent in the polls, while the Tories have surged to the mid-to-high 30s. Moreover, Farage has intimated that he might cooperate with the Tories strategically, targeting constituencies where left-wing Leave voters are concentrated to pull them away from Labour, while staying away from seats that would be contested between the Remain-oriented Liberal Democrats and the Leave-oriented Tories.How could such a strategy work if Brexit is only getting less-popular with time? The answer comes down to intensity and cohesion.If Tory Remain voters -- of which there were many -- cared more about stopping Brexit than they did about the fate of their party, they would defect to the Liberal Democrats, badly damaging the Tories' chances of winning a majority. Similarly, if Labour Remain voters felt that Brexit was the most important issue, they would either have pushed Corbyn to a more decisive Remain stance, or would be working strategically with the Liberal Democrats in the way that the Brexit Party may work with the Tories. And the Liberal Democrats would be doing the same.But while Brexit may be a politically-defining event for the liberal center, for the left this is their first chance at power since the 1970s -- not something to be traded away lightly for the sake of free trade with Germany or even stability in Ireland. Even for liberal centrists, the choice between Corbyn and Johnson may be a tough one. For the right, meanwhile, the party as a whole seems to have come to realize that while the hard Leave voters are a minority in the country, they hold the balance of power within the Tory coalition. If they are not given the wheel, the coach isn't going anywhere.Now they have the wheel, and a Leave coalition looks likely to triumph decisively, in spite of all regrets.What happens then? The opposition could continue to come up with explanations for why the result doesn't truly reflect the will of the people -- blaming the electoral system, for instance (though in current polling the Tory-plus-Brexit coalition outpolls Labour-plus-Lib-Dems by an average of five points, suggesting even proportional representation would give victory to the Brexiteers). But they would be wiser to focus on the future. No longer dependent on the votes of Irish Unionists, nor needing to cater to the concerns of the Scottish Nationalists, a big Tory majority could govern from the center of England rather than Britain.The biggest post-Brexit challenge may not be how to get Britain back into Europe, but how to hold Britain itself together.Want more essential commentary and analysis like this delivered straight to your inbox?

Chris Christie Among Lawyers Making $15 Million in 1MDB Pact,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 12:10:31 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/chris-christie-among-lawyers-reaping-133349408.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest recovery ever from an American anti-corruption crackdown is proving lucrative for former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.A major deal struck by the U.S. for fugitive financier Jho Low to give up almost $1 billion in assets allegedly stolen from a Malaysian investment fund comes with a provision to pay his lawyers. As part of the 1MDB settlement, the Justice Department allowed for $15 million to be paid to a group advising Jho Low, including the law firm Christie set up after two terms as New Jersey’s governor.Those proceeds will come from Jho Low’s stake in EMI Music Publishing, which has grown to about $415 million. That investment ballooned after he initially put in a little more than $100 million stolen from 1MDB, according to prosecutors. The two sides agreed to the provision to allow the lawyers to extract fees from Low, whose assets and accounts have been seized or monitored by authorities across the world.“We were pleased to help negotiate this historic resolution in order to preserve the tremendous value of assets involved,” Christie said in a statement after the Justice Department announced the settlement agreement on Wednesday. It still needs approval from a federal judge.Christie, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 before dropping out and endorsing Donald Trump, set up his own law firm last year, the Christie Law Firm LLC. The other firms that will receive proceeds of the 1MDB deal for legal expenses are Kobre & Kim LLP and Lowenstein Sandler LLP.The agreement comes even before the criminal charges against Low have been resolved. In the settlement, the Justice Department cautioned that the released funds should be used only for the Low family’s legal fees and costs related to the lawsuits, and can’t be routed back to Low or his family.The cases were resolved in a “collaborative and fair way that includes payment of our legal fees,” said Robin Rathmell, a lawyer at Kobre & Kim.(Updates with lawyer’s comment in last paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Sridhar Natarajan in New York at snatarajan15@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

Singh, a convener of the the farmers’ group. Imports of dairy and agricultural products including wheat, cotton and oil seeds would affect the livelihood of millions of Indian farmers, he said.The government should defer signing of the agreement and hold consultations with farmers, state governments and other stake holders before taking a final decision, said Singh. “We have to stop RCEP,” he said.It is not clear yet what terms India will agree to in order to join what could become the world’s largest trade deal.

Authorities Identify ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe’ Through DNA and Now the Real Questions Start,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:13:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/authorities-identify-fly-creek-jane-131307745.html,"On a chilly February Sunday in 1980, a father and son panning for gold along Fly Creek in Clark County, Washington, kicked up the remains of a human skeleton that appeared to have been buried in a shallow grave. They called the authorities who came to collect the skull and what bones hadn’t been dragged away by animals, and were able to use the remains to construct a facial reconstruction that produced a picture of a teenage girl. Detectives were able to deduce that she died from a cause that did not seem natural. Calls for information, searches through missing persons reports, and detective work turned up nothing. No one seemed to miss the teen, dubbed the ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe,’ and, for the last 40 years, that is as far as the case went–until now.This summer Clark County detectives decided to post a DNA sample from the old remains to the Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, a public genealogy database that has had recent success closing old cold cases. The lab found a tie to a distant cousin of a teen named Sandra “Sandy” Renee Morden who said she was last seen in 1977–three years before her skeletal remains were found. Courtesy of Clark County SheriffThe Oregonian then dug up an old birthday announcement that was tied to the case. On April 29, 1977, in the classified section of the paper, a tiny ad appeared that said: “Sandra Renee Morden, Happy 15th Birthday. Love Always—Mom.” Such published greetings were a common way to mark a birthday or anniversary in the era before Facebook and other social media. Morden’s parents were divorced, according to the DNA-linked cousin, who does not want to be named and who provided Clark County cold-case detective Lindsay Schultz with the only clues the teen’s life. Schultz told the Oregonian that Morden was a “latchkey kid” who was mostly “unsupervised.” There is no indication that the parents filed a missing persons report, and, as Schultz says, “We didn’t have [the National Crime Information Center] at that time.” The detective says Morden’s parents came from the San Francisco area and settled in Portland. They split up in the early 1970s, and did not communicate with each other. The girl’s mother, identified as Kathryn Irene Morden, apparently lost custody and the cousin said Sandy most often stayed with her father, identified as Andrew Bain Morden, a Marine Corps veteran who fought in the Korean War. Schultz says she likely fell through the cracks when one parent thought the other had her. She last attended Wilson High School in Portland. Schultz told the Oregonian that the father likely thought she was with her mother. He had left her alone for an extended period of time and when he came back, she was gone, so he assumed she had gone to her mother’s home. “We don’t know for certain,” Schultz says. “We know that’s what family members believe.”Both parents are dead, so there is no way to confirm what either of them knew. Schultz told the Oregonian that it is the birthday greeting that bothers him most. It was posted around the time the extended family says she disappeared. “Was it just a mom who loved her daughter–or did her mom know something and put it out there for that reason?” Schultz said. “It’s one of those two, right? You ponder it. You look at it and you think, ‘What does it mean?’”Now detectives are looking for the missing puzzle pieces. They are calling on anyone who might have any information about Morden, her parents, or how she might have died to contact the Clark County Medical Examiner's Office or Clark County Sheriff's Office Cold Case Tip Line.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

"KGB Judged ‘Comrade V.V. Putin’ a Disciplined, Conscientious Spy","Thu, 31 Oct 2019 06:46:29 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/kgb-judged-comrade-v-v-104629972.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin was “prompt, disciplined and conscientious” as a spy in the KGB, according to a declassified profile from the Soviet Union’s feared security service.“Comrade V.V. Putin constantly improves his ideological and political standards,” according to the document exhibited at the Central State Archive for Historical-Political Documents of St. Petersburg, the Russian leader’s home city. “He’s actively engaged in party education work.”The profile, which is also on show at a Moscow exhibition of “outstanding figures” of modern Russian history, describes Putin as “morally upstanding” and enjoying “well-deserved authority among colleagues,” noting that he won a judo championship in 1978.Putin joined the KGB in 1975 after graduating from the law faculty of Leningrad State University, located in what’s now St. Petersburg, and served as a spy for more than 15 years until the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991. Putin asked to become a KGB officer even before he finished school, according to his Kremlin biography, which cites him saying his view of the organization “was based on idealistic stories I heard about intelligence.”He served in Dresden in East Germany from 1985 until 1990, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel during a largely undistinguished stint, and was awarded a bronze medal for service to the National People’s Army of the German Democratic Republic. He headed the Federal Security Service, the main successor agency of the KGB, in 1998-1999 before President Boris Yeltsin made him prime minister and named Putin as his chosen successor. Putin was elected president in 2000.The KGB’s appraisal of Putin, which appears to be from the late 1970s or early 1980s, was absolutely standard and showed that he hadn’t stood out or achieved anything in particular, according to Alexei Kondaurov, a former KGB general. “Usually we wrote ‘morally upstanding’ when there was nothing else to say,” he said.Still, there’s been “colossal” public interest in the document, shown as part of commemorations of the archive’s 90th anniversary, said Olga Bobrova, deputy head of the institution.To contact the reporters on this story: Irina Reznik in Moscow at ireznik@bloomberg.net;Henry Meyer in Moscow at hmeyer4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Gregory L.

Why the Tories are cruising toward a big win in Britain,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 05:50:02 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/why-tories-cruising-toward-big-095002680.html,"The polling is clear. Over the more than three years since they voted to leave the European Union, British voters have come to regret their choice. Polls consistently show a several-point margin in favor of Remain, only one in three voters will endorse the proposition that getting Brexit over with is better than further delay, and two thirds believe that a no-deal Brexit should require another referendum.So why are Boris Johnson's Tories, running on a clearer stance for Brexit than ever before, currently projected to win a decisive victory in the December election?The simplest answer is: the opposition is divided. But that answer obscures more than it reveals, because it presumes that the question of Brexit is as dominant among the opposition as it is among the Tories. And the division of the opposition itself proves that this is not the case. On the contrary: Brexit is a truly existential question for a far larger fraction of Leave voters than it is of Remain voters, and that has had and continues to have material electoral consequences.Consider the largest opposition party. Labour under Jeremy Corbin has trended in an overwhelmingly left-wing direction, not only on economic matters but also on immigration and foreign policy. A ""no enemies on the left"" approach has even seen extremist illiberal and anti-Semitic elements gain a greater foothold within the party. But on Brexit, Corbyn has taken a somewhat ambiguous stance, reflecting the fact that while a majority of Labourites voted Remain, a not insignificant number had always been skeptical of an economic arrangement that gave financial interests greater influence at both the national and European levels of government.That combination of stridency and straddle hasn't played well in electoral terms, and has opened space for two other parties to establish themselves as alternatives: the Liberal Democrats, a longstanding centrist liberal party that has positioned itself as the unequivocal party of Remain, and the Brexit Party, a newly-minted political faction founded by Nigel Farage, the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party. At one point this past summer, both parties looked capable of surpassing the Tories, and possibly Labour as well.Since Boris Johnson took the premiership, though, the picture has changed dramatically. The Brexit party has fallen back to 10-12 percent in the polls, while the Tories have surged to the mid-to-high 30s. Moreover, Farage has intimated that he might cooperate with the Tories strategically, targeting constituencies where left-wing Leave voters are concentrated to pull them away from Labour, while staying away from seats that would be contested between the Remain-oriented Liberal Democrats and the Leave-oriented Tories.How could such a strategy work if Brexit is only getting less-popular with time? The answer comes down to intensity and cohesion.If Tory Remain voters -- of which there were many -- cared more about stopping Brexit than they did about the fate of their party, they would defect to the Liberal Democrats, badly damaging the Tories' chances of winning a majority. Similarly, if Labour Remain voters felt that Brexit was the most important issue, they would either have pushed Corbyn to a more decisive Remain stance, or would be working strategically with the Liberal Democrats in the way that the Brexit Party may work with the Tories. And the Liberal Democrats would be doing the same.But while Brexit may be a politically-defining event for the liberal center, for the left this is their first chance at power since the 1970s -- not something to be traded away lightly for the sake of free trade with Germany or even stability in Ireland. Even for liberal centrists, the choice between Corbyn and Johnson may be a tough one. For the right, meanwhile, the party as a whole seems to have come to realize that while the hard Leave voters are a minority in the country, they hold the balance of power within the Tory coalition. If they are not given the wheel, the coach isn't going anywhere.Now they have the wheel, and a Leave coalition looks likely to triumph decisively, in spite of all regrets.What happens then? The opposition could continue to come up with explanations for why the result doesn't truly reflect the will of the people -- blaming the electoral system, for instance (though in current polling the Tory-plus-Brexit coalition outpolls Labour-plus-Lib-Dems by an average of five points, suggesting even proportional representation would give victory to the Brexiteers). But they would be wiser to focus on the future. No longer dependent on the votes of Irish Unionists, nor needing to cater to the concerns of the Scottish Nationalists, a big Tory majority could govern from the center of England rather than Britain.The biggest post-Brexit challenge may not be how to get Britain back into Europe, but how to hold Britain itself together.Want more essential commentary and analysis like this delivered straight to your inbox?

Chris Christie Among Lawyers Making $15 Million in 1MDB Pact,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 12:10:31 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/chris-christie-among-lawyers-reaping-133349408.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest recovery ever from an American anti-corruption crackdown is proving lucrative for former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.A major deal struck by the U.S. for fugitive financier Jho Low to give up almost $1 billion in assets allegedly stolen from a Malaysian investment fund comes with a provision to pay his lawyers. As part of the 1MDB settlement, the Justice Department allowed for $15 million to be paid to a group advising Jho Low, including the law firm Christie set up after two terms as New Jersey’s governor.Those proceeds will come from Jho Low’s stake in EMI Music Publishing, which has grown to about $415 million. That investment ballooned after he initially put in a little more than $100 million stolen from 1MDB, according to prosecutors. The two sides agreed to the provision to allow the lawyers to extract fees from Low, whose assets and accounts have been seized or monitored by authorities across the world.“We were pleased to help negotiate this historic resolution in order to preserve the tremendous value of assets involved,” Christie said in a statement after the Justice Department announced the settlement agreement on Wednesday. It still needs approval from a federal judge.Christie, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 before dropping out and endorsing Donald Trump, set up his own law firm last year, the Christie Law Firm LLC. The other firms that will receive proceeds of the 1MDB deal for legal expenses are Kobre & Kim LLP and Lowenstein Sandler LLP.The agreement comes even before the criminal charges against Low have been resolved. In the settlement, the Justice Department cautioned that the released funds should be used only for the Low family’s legal fees and costs related to the lawsuits, and can’t be routed back to Low or his family.The cases were resolved in a “collaborative and fair way that includes payment of our legal fees,” said Robin Rathmell, a lawyer at Kobre & Kim.(Updates with lawyer’s comment in last paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Sridhar Natarajan in New York at snatarajan15@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

Authorities Identify ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe’ Through DNA and Now the Real Questions Start,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 09:13:07 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/authorities-identify-fly-creek-jane-131307745.html,"On a chilly February Sunday in 1980, a father and son panning for gold along Fly Creek in Clark County, Washington, kicked up the remains of a human skeleton that appeared to have been buried in a shallow grave. They called the authorities who came to collect the skull and what bones hadn’t been dragged away by animals, and were able to use the remains to construct a facial reconstruction that produced a picture of a teenage girl. Detectives were able to deduce that she died from a cause that did not seem natural. Calls for information, searches through missing persons reports, and detective work turned up nothing. No one seemed to miss the teen, dubbed the ‘Fly Creek Jane Doe,’ and, for the last 40 years, that is as far as the case went–until now.This summer Clark County detectives decided to post a DNA sample from the old remains to the Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs, a public genealogy database that has had recent success closing old cold cases. The lab found a tie to a distant cousin of a teen named Sandra “Sandy” Renee Morden who said she was last seen in 1977–three years before her skeletal remains were found. Courtesy of Clark County SheriffThe Oregonian then dug up an old birthday announcement that was tied to the case. On April 29, 1977, in the classified section of the paper, a tiny ad appeared that said: “Sandra Renee Morden, Happy 15th Birthday. Love Always—Mom.” Such published greetings were a common way to mark a birthday or anniversary in the era before Facebook and other social media. Morden’s parents were divorced, according to the DNA-linked cousin, who does not want to be named and who provided Clark County cold-case detective Lindsay Schultz with the only clues the teen’s life. Schultz told the Oregonian that Morden was a “latchkey kid” who was mostly “unsupervised.” There is no indication that the parents filed a missing persons report, and, as Schultz says, “We didn’t have [the National Crime Information Center] at that time.” The detective says Morden’s parents came from the San Francisco area and settled in Portland. They split up in the early 1970s, and did not communicate with each other. The girl’s mother, identified as Kathryn Irene Morden, apparently lost custody and the cousin said Sandy most often stayed with her father, identified as Andrew Bain Morden, a Marine Corps veteran who fought in the Korean War. Schultz says she likely fell through the cracks when one parent thought the other had her. She last attended Wilson High School in Portland. Schultz told the Oregonian that the father likely thought she was with her mother. He had left her alone for an extended period of time and when he came back, she was gone, so he assumed she had gone to her mother’s home. “We don’t know for certain,” Schultz says. “We know that’s what family members believe.”Both parents are dead, so there is no way to confirm what either of them knew. Schultz told the Oregonian that it is the birthday greeting that bothers him most. It was posted around the time the extended family says she disappeared. “Was it just a mom who loved her daughter–or did her mom know something and put it out there for that reason?” Schultz said. “It’s one of those two, right? You ponder it. You look at it and you think, ‘What does it mean?’”Now detectives are looking for the missing puzzle pieces. They are calling on anyone who might have any information about Morden, her parents, or how she might have died to contact the Clark County Medical Examiner's Office or Clark County Sheriff's Office Cold Case Tip Line.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

"KGB Judged ‘Comrade V.V. Putin’ a Disciplined, Conscientious Spy","Thu, 31 Oct 2019 06:46:29 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/kgb-judged-comrade-v-v-104629972.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin was “prompt, disciplined and conscientious” as a spy in the KGB, according to a declassified profile from the Soviet Union’s feared security service.“Comrade V.V. Putin constantly improves his ideological and political standards,” according to the document exhibited at the Central State Archive for Historical-Political Documents of St. Petersburg, the Russian leader’s home city. “He’s actively engaged in party education work.”The profile, which is also on show at a Moscow exhibition of “outstanding figures” of modern Russian history, describes Putin as “morally upstanding” and enjoying “well-deserved authority among colleagues,” noting that he won a judo championship in 1978.Putin joined the KGB in 1975 after graduating from the law faculty of Leningrad State University, located in what’s now St. Petersburg, and served as a spy for more than 15 years until the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991. Putin asked to become a KGB officer even before he finished school, according to his Kremlin biography, which cites him saying his view of the organization “was based on idealistic stories I heard about intelligence.”He served in Dresden in East Germany from 1985 until 1990, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel during a largely undistinguished stint, and was awarded a bronze medal for service to the National People’s Army of the German Democratic Republic. He headed the Federal Security Service, the main successor agency of the KGB, in 1998-1999 before President Boris Yeltsin made him prime minister and named Putin as his chosen successor. Putin was elected president in 2000.The KGB’s appraisal of Putin, which appears to be from the late 1970s or early 1980s, was absolutely standard and showed that he hadn’t stood out or achieved anything in particular, according to Alexei Kondaurov, a former KGB general. “Usually we wrote ‘morally upstanding’ when there was nothing else to say,” he said.Still, there’s been “colossal” public interest in the document, shown as part of commemorations of the archive’s 90th anniversary, said Olga Bobrova, deputy head of the institution.To contact the reporters on this story: Irina Reznik in Moscow at ireznik@bloomberg.net;Henry Meyer in Moscow at hmeyer4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Gregory L.

Why the Tories are cruising toward a big win in Britain,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 05:50:02 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/why-tories-cruising-toward-big-095002680.html,"The polling is clear. Over the more than three years since they voted to leave the European Union, British voters have come to regret their choice. Polls consistently show a several-point margin in favor of Remain, only one in three voters will endorse the proposition that getting Brexit over with is better than further delay, and two thirds believe that a no-deal Brexit should require another referendum.So why are Boris Johnson's Tories, running on a clearer stance for Brexit than ever before, currently projected to win a decisive victory in the December election?The simplest answer is: the opposition is divided. But that answer obscures more than it reveals, because it presumes that the question of Brexit is as dominant among the opposition as it is among the Tories. And the division of the opposition itself proves that this is not the case. On the contrary: Brexit is a truly existential question for a far larger fraction of Leave voters than it is of Remain voters, and that has had and continues to have material electoral consequences.Consider the largest opposition party. Labour under Jeremy Corbin has trended in an overwhelmingly left-wing direction, not only on economic matters but also on immigration and foreign policy. A ""no enemies on the left"" approach has even seen extremist illiberal and anti-Semitic elements gain a greater foothold within the party. But on Brexit, Corbyn has taken a somewhat ambiguous stance, reflecting the fact that while a majority of Labourites voted Remain, a not insignificant number had always been skeptical of an economic arrangement that gave financial interests greater influence at both the national and European levels of government.That combination of stridency and straddle hasn't played well in electoral terms, and has opened space for two other parties to establish themselves as alternatives: the Liberal Democrats, a longstanding centrist liberal party that has positioned itself as the unequivocal party of Remain, and the Brexit Party, a newly-minted political faction founded by Nigel Farage, the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party. At one point this past summer, both parties looked capable of surpassing the Tories, and possibly Labour as well.Since Boris Johnson took the premiership, though, the picture has changed dramatically. The Brexit party has fallen back to 10-12 percent in the polls, while the Tories have surged to the mid-to-high 30s. Moreover, Farage has intimated that he might cooperate with the Tories strategically, targeting constituencies where left-wing Leave voters are concentrated to pull them away from Labour, while staying away from seats that would be contested between the Remain-oriented Liberal Democrats and the Leave-oriented Tories.How could such a strategy work if Brexit is only getting less-popular with time? The answer comes down to intensity and cohesion.If Tory Remain voters -- of which there were many -- cared more about stopping Brexit than they did about the fate of their party, they would defect to the Liberal Democrats, badly damaging the Tories' chances of winning a majority. Similarly, if Labour Remain voters felt that Brexit was the most important issue, they would either have pushed Corbyn to a more decisive Remain stance, or would be working strategically with the Liberal Democrats in the way that the Brexit Party may work with the Tories. And the Liberal Democrats would be doing the same.But while Brexit may be a politically-defining event for the liberal center, for the left this is their first chance at power since the 1970s -- not something to be traded away lightly for the sake of free trade with Germany or even stability in Ireland. Even for liberal centrists, the choice between Corbyn and Johnson may be a tough one. For the right, meanwhile, the party as a whole seems to have come to realize that while the hard Leave voters are a minority in the country, they hold the balance of power within the Tory coalition. If they are not given the wheel, the coach isn't going anywhere.Now they have the wheel, and a Leave coalition looks likely to triumph decisively, in spite of all regrets.What happens then? The opposition could continue to come up with explanations for why the result doesn't truly reflect the will of the people -- blaming the electoral system, for instance (though in current polling the Tory-plus-Brexit coalition outpolls Labour-plus-Lib-Dems by an average of five points, suggesting even proportional representation would give victory to the Brexiteers). But they would be wiser to focus on the future. No longer dependent on the votes of Irish Unionists, nor needing to cater to the concerns of the Scottish Nationalists, a big Tory majority could govern from the center of England rather than Britain.The biggest post-Brexit challenge may not be how to get Britain back into Europe, but how to hold Britain itself together.Want more essential commentary and analysis like this delivered straight to your inbox?

Chris Christie Among Lawyers Making $15 Million in 1MDB Pact,"Thu, 31 Oct 2019 12:10:31 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/chris-christie-among-lawyers-reaping-133349408.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest recovery ever from an American anti-corruption crackdown is proving lucrative for former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.A major deal struck by the U.S. for fugitive financier Jho Low to give up almost $1 billion in assets allegedly stolen from a Malaysian investment fund comes with a provision to pay his lawyers. As part of the 1MDB settlement, the Justice Department allowed for $15 million to be paid to a group advising Jho Low, including the law firm Christie set up after two terms as New Jersey’s governor.Those proceeds will come from Jho Low’s stake in EMI Music Publishing, which has grown to about $415 million. That investment ballooned after he initially put in a little more than $100 million stolen from 1MDB, according to prosecutors. The two sides agreed to the provision to allow the lawyers to extract fees from Low, whose assets and accounts have been seized or monitored by authorities across the world.“We were pleased to help negotiate this historic resolution in order to preserve the tremendous value of assets involved,” Christie said in a statement after the Justice Department announced the settlement agreement on Wednesday. It still needs approval from a federal judge.Christie, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 before dropping out and endorsing Donald Trump, set up his own law firm last year, the Christie Law Firm LLC. The other firms that will receive proceeds of the 1MDB deal for legal expenses are Kobre & Kim LLP and Lowenstein Sandler LLP.The agreement comes even before the criminal charges against Low have been resolved. In the settlement, the Justice Department cautioned that the released funds should be used only for the Low family’s legal fees and costs related to the lawsuits, and can’t be routed back to Low or his family.The cases were resolved in a “collaborative and fair way that includes payment of our legal fees,” said Robin Rathmell, a lawyer at Kobre & Kim.(Updates with lawyer’s comment in last paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Sridhar Natarajan in New York at snatarajan15@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.

Imports of dairy and agricultural products including wheat, cotton and oil seeds would affect the livelihood of millions of Indian farmers, he said.The government should defer signing of the agreement and hold consultations with farmers, state governments and other stake holders before taking a final decision, said Singh. “We have to stop RCEP,” he said.It is not clear yet what terms India will agree to in order to join what could become the world’s largest trade deal.

They are calling on anyone who might have any information about Morden, her parents, or how she might have died to contact the Clark County Medical Examiner's Office or Clark County Sheriff's Office Cold Case Tip Line.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

"KGB Judged ‘Comrade V.V. Putin’ a Disciplined, Conscientious Spy","Thu, 31 Oct 2019 06:46:29 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/kgb-judged-comrade-v-v-104629972.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin was “prompt, disciplined and conscientious” as a spy in the KGB, according to a declassified profile from the Soviet Union’s feared security service.“Comrade V.V. Putin constantly improves his ideological and political standards,” according to the document exhibited at the Central State Archive for Historical-Political Documents of St. Petersburg, the Russian leader’s home city. “He’s actively engaged in party education work.”The profile, which is also on show at a Moscow exhibition of “outstanding figures” of modern Russian history, describes Putin as “morally upstanding” and enjoying “well-deserved authority among colleagues,” noting that he won a judo championship in 1978.Putin joined the KGB in 1975 after graduating from the law faculty of Leningrad State University, located in what’s now St. Petersburg, and served as a spy for more than 15 years until the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991. Putin asked to become a KGB officer even before he finished school, according to his Kremlin biography, which cites him saying his view of the organization “was based on idealistic stories I heard about intelligence.”He served in Dresden in East Germany from 1985 until 1990, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel during a largely undistinguished stint, and was awarded a bronze medal for service to the National People’s Army of the German Democratic Republic. He headed the Federal Security Service, the main successor agency of the KGB, in 1998-1999 before President Boris Yeltsin made him prime minister and named Putin as his chosen successor. Putin was elected president in 2000.The KGB’s appraisal of Putin, which appears to be from the late 1970s or early 1980s, was absolutely standard and showed that he hadn’t stood out or achieved anything in particular, according to Alexei Kondaurov, a former KGB general. “Usually we wrote ‘morally upstanding’ when there was nothing else to say,” he said.Still, there’s been “colossal” public interest in the document, shown as part of commemorations of the archive’s 90th anniversary, said Olga Bobrova, deputy head of the institution.To contact the reporters on this story: Irina Reznik in Moscow at ireznik@bloomberg.net;Henry Meyer in Moscow at hmeyer4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Gregory L.
