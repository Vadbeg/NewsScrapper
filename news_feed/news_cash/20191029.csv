Prosecutors Attack Michael Flynn’s ‘Extraordinary Reversal’ on His Guilt,"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 15:47:47 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/prosecutors-attack-michael-flynn-extraordinary-194747328.html,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. prosecutors criticized Michael Flynn’s “extraordinary reversal” in proclaiming his innocence despite his admission of guilt before two federal judges.In a court filing on Tuesday, prosecutors denied they had engaged in misconduct, as Flynn’s lawyers assert, and attacked their efforts to paint Flynn as innocent of lying to investigators despite his guilty plea.“The defendant now claims that he is innocent of the criminal charges in this case,” U.S. prosecutors Brandon Van Grack and Jocelyn Ballantine wrote. They said he claimed he was honest during a January 2017 interview “despite having admitted his guilt, under oath.”A lawyer for Flynn, President Donald Trump’s first national security adviser, wants a judge to throw out the case because of prosecutorial misconduct, saying that prosecutors failed to disclose exculpatory evidence before Flynn pleaded guilty in December 2017 to lying to federal agents.The lawyer, Sidney Powell, argued in an Oct. 24 filing that FBI agents created a false summary of their interview with Flynn about his conversations with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. at the time, Sergey Kislyak. Powell claims that Flynn didn’t remember making four or five calls to Kislyak from the Dominican Republic after Trump’s election, yet the summary falsely said Flynn remembered the calls.Powell also says that Van Grack made incomplete and misleading disclosures of the government’s evidence, and that the FBI “knew its entire investigation of Flynn was a pretext.” She asked a judge to order prosecutors to turn over evidence sought by the defense, hold prosecutors in contempt and “dismiss the entire prosecution for outrageous government misconduct.”FBI agents claimed that Flynn made false statements during an interview on Jan. 24, 2017, about multiple topics, yet Powell wrote that her client was “honest with the agents to the best of his recollection at the time, and the agents knew it.”Flynn was Trump’s national security adviser for less than a month before resigning over the criminal investigation against him. Trump later urged the FBI director, James Comey, to shut down the investigation. Comey declined and was fired, prompting the Justice Department to appoint Robert Mueller to investigate the firing as part of a broad inquiry into Russian election interference.Prosecutors said Flynn, a former Army general and head of the Pentagon’s Defense Intelligence Agency, improperly raised several new arguments and claims recently for the first time. They asked U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan in Washington how they should respond in light of his decision on Monday to cancel a hearing set for Nov. 7. He’ll now decide the matter based on the filings submitted to him.Powell denied in an email that she intends to withdraw Flynn’s guilty plea. Instead, she cited the federal criminal case against the late Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, which Sullivan threw out in 2009 after prosecutors withheld exculpatory evidence.In the email, Powell said: “I have long maintained General Flynn’s innocence, and the government knows that, but there is no requirement that I withdraw the plea. It is an issue of procedure. The entire prosecution should be dismissed for egregious government misconduct. For example, Ted Stevens did not have to seek or have a motion for new trial granted to have his entire prosecution dismissed.”Sullivan has set a target sentencing date of Dec. 18 for Flynn.The case is U.S. v. Flynn, 17-cr-232, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia (Washington).READ MORE:Michael Flynn Lawyer Assails U.S. Case Against Ex-Trump AideFlynn Lawyers, Prosecutors Spar Over Readiness for SentenceFlynn’s Risk of Prison Resurfaces as Judge Flags ‘Serious’ CrimeTo contact the reporters on this story: David Voreacos in New York at dvoreacos@bloomberg.net;Andrew Harris in federal court in Washington at aharris16@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jeffrey D Grocott at jgrocott2@bloomberg.net, David S.

Trump Sides With Indicted Oligarch Over His Own Diplomat,"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 19:10:45 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/trump-sides-indicted-oligarch-over-231045762.html,"Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump boosted a tweet Monday promoting a controversial allegation from an indicted Ukrainian oligarch: that a top U.S. diplomat put fabricated information about the mogul in a diplomatic cable. That diplomat happens to be one of Democrats’ key impeachment witnesses. And that oligarch happens to have a long-standing beef with Joe Biden.Scott Adams, a Washington, D.C., talk radio host, sent out a tweet Monday night about U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor, who delivered some of the impeachment inquiry’s most damaging testimony yet. The tweet alleged that Taylor lied about Ukrainian natural gas baron Dmytro Firtash in a cable to State Department headquarters in 2008. At issue was a conversation Taylor had with Firtash in Kyiv that December. Taylor wrote in a diplomatic cable (later published by WikiLeaks) that Firtash told him he had “acknowledged ties to Russian organized crime figure [Semion] Seymon Mogilevich,” one of the most notorious accused mobsters on the planet. According to Taylor, Firtash said “he needed Mogilevich's approval to get into business in the first place,” but had not committed any crimes in the course of his business.When WikiLeaks published the cable in 2010, Firtash issued a statement on his website disputing its contents. Firtash, the statement claimed,“has never stated, to anyone, at any time, that he needed or received permission from Mr. Mogilevich to establish any of his businesses.”Earlier this year, Firtash reiterated that defense. Without mentioning any American official by name, he said someone must have fabricated the detail about Mogilevich. Taylor, meanwhile, has defended the State Department’s notes. The Justice Department appears to side with Taylor; its lawyers have argued in court that Firtash has ties to Russian organized crime. The criminal charges he faces, however, don’t involve any such alleged relationships. Instead, the Justice Department charged him in 2014 with helming a conspiracy to bribe Indian government officials. Trump’s retweet, however, offers a presidential thumbs-up to Firtash’s side of the story, and raises a new line of attack on Taylor’s credibility for the president’s allies.  Asked about his sourcing for the allegations against Taylor, Adams told The Daily Beast, “My sources are solid Foggy Bottom people.” He also noted the explanation for the cable that Firtash provided to The Daily Beast earlier this year.This specific defense of Firtash took hold in The Hill over the summer, when columnist John Solomon, whose articles informed Rudy Giuliani’s Biden-Ukraine investigation, published a piece in July claiming that Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s deputy said Firtash’s criminal charges in the U.S. might “go away” if he shared damaging information about Trump with Mueller’s team. Solomon cited “multiple sources with direct knowledge” and contemporaneous memos. Firtash and Solomon share the same lawyers: Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova. The husband-wife team are veterans of the conservative movement’s most contentious legal battles, with longstanding ties in the Justice Department and Trump administration. Ukrainian Oligarch Seethed About ‘Overlord’ Biden for YearsRead more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

Prosecutors Attack Michael Flynn’s ‘Extraordinary Reversal’ on His Guilt,"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 15:47:47 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/prosecutors-attack-michael-flynn-extraordinary-194747328.html,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. prosecutors criticized Michael Flynn’s “extraordinary reversal” in proclaiming his innocence despite his admission of guilt before two federal judges.In a court filing on Tuesday, prosecutors denied they had engaged in misconduct, as Flynn’s lawyers assert, and attacked their efforts to paint Flynn as innocent of lying to investigators despite his guilty plea.“The defendant now claims that he is innocent of the criminal charges in this case,” U.S. prosecutors Brandon Van Grack and Jocelyn Ballantine wrote. They said he claimed he was honest during a January 2017 interview “despite having admitted his guilt, under oath.”A lawyer for Flynn, President Donald Trump’s first national security adviser, wants a judge to throw out the case because of prosecutorial misconduct, saying that prosecutors failed to disclose exculpatory evidence before Flynn pleaded guilty in December 2017 to lying to federal agents.The lawyer, Sidney Powell, argued in an Oct. 24 filing that FBI agents created a false summary of their interview with Flynn about his conversations with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. at the time, Sergey Kislyak. Powell claims that Flynn didn’t remember making four or five calls to Kislyak from the Dominican Republic after Trump’s election, yet the summary falsely said Flynn remembered the calls.Powell also says that Van Grack made incomplete and misleading disclosures of the government’s evidence, and that the FBI “knew its entire investigation of Flynn was a pretext.” She asked a judge to order prosecutors to turn over evidence sought by the defense, hold prosecutors in contempt and “dismiss the entire prosecution for outrageous government misconduct.”FBI agents claimed that Flynn made false statements during an interview on Jan. 24, 2017, about multiple topics, yet Powell wrote that her client was “honest with the agents to the best of his recollection at the time, and the agents knew it.”Flynn was Trump’s national security adviser for less than a month before resigning over the criminal investigation against him. Trump later urged the FBI director, James Comey, to shut down the investigation. Comey declined and was fired, prompting the Justice Department to appoint Robert Mueller to investigate the firing as part of a broad inquiry into Russian election interference.Prosecutors said Flynn, a former Army general and head of the Pentagon’s Defense Intelligence Agency, improperly raised several new arguments and claims recently for the first time. They asked U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan in Washington how they should respond in light of his decision on Monday to cancel a hearing set for Nov. 7. He’ll now decide the matter based on the filings submitted to him.Powell denied in an email that she intends to withdraw Flynn’s guilty plea. Instead, she cited the federal criminal case against the late Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, which Sullivan threw out in 2009 after prosecutors withheld exculpatory evidence.In the email, Powell said: “I have long maintained General Flynn’s innocence, and the government knows that, but there is no requirement that I withdraw the plea. It is an issue of procedure. The entire prosecution should be dismissed for egregious government misconduct. For example, Ted Stevens did not have to seek or have a motion for new trial granted to have his entire prosecution dismissed.”Sullivan has set a target sentencing date of Dec. 18 for Flynn.The case is U.S. v. Flynn, 17-cr-232, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia (Washington).READ MORE:Michael Flynn Lawyer Assails U.S. Case Against Ex-Trump AideFlynn Lawyers, Prosecutors Spar Over Readiness for SentenceFlynn’s Risk of Prison Resurfaces as Judge Flags ‘Serious’ CrimeTo contact the reporters on this story: David Voreacos in New York at dvoreacos@bloomberg.net;Andrew Harris in federal court in Washington at aharris16@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jeffrey D Grocott at jgrocott2@bloomberg.net, David S.

Trump Sides With Indicted Oligarch Over His Own Diplomat,"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 19:10:45 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/trump-sides-indicted-oligarch-over-231045762.html,"Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump boosted a tweet Monday promoting a controversial allegation from an indicted Ukrainian oligarch: that a top U.S. diplomat put fabricated information about the mogul in a diplomatic cable. That diplomat happens to be one of Democrats’ key impeachment witnesses. And that oligarch happens to have a long-standing beef with Joe Biden.Scott Adams, a Washington, D.C., talk radio host, sent out a tweet Monday night about U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor, who delivered some of the impeachment inquiry’s most damaging testimony yet. The tweet alleged that Taylor lied about Ukrainian natural gas baron Dmytro Firtash in a cable to State Department headquarters in 2008. At issue was a conversation Taylor had with Firtash in Kyiv that December. Taylor wrote in a diplomatic cable (later published by WikiLeaks) that Firtash told him he had “acknowledged ties to Russian organized crime figure [Semion] Seymon Mogilevich,” one of the most notorious accused mobsters on the planet. According to Taylor, Firtash said “he needed Mogilevich's approval to get into business in the first place,” but had not committed any crimes in the course of his business.When WikiLeaks published the cable in 2010, Firtash issued a statement on his website disputing its contents. Firtash, the statement claimed,“has never stated, to anyone, at any time, that he needed or received permission from Mr. Mogilevich to establish any of his businesses.”Earlier this year, Firtash reiterated that defense. Without mentioning any American official by name, he said someone must have fabricated the detail about Mogilevich. Taylor, meanwhile, has defended the State Department’s notes. The Justice Department appears to side with Taylor; its lawyers have argued in court that Firtash has ties to Russian organized crime. The criminal charges he faces, however, don’t involve any such alleged relationships. Instead, the Justice Department charged him in 2014 with helming a conspiracy to bribe Indian government officials. Trump’s retweet, however, offers a presidential thumbs-up to Firtash’s side of the story, and raises a new line of attack on Taylor’s credibility for the president’s allies.  Asked about his sourcing for the allegations against Taylor, Adams told The Daily Beast, “My sources are solid Foggy Bottom people.” He also noted the explanation for the cable that Firtash provided to The Daily Beast earlier this year.This specific defense of Firtash took hold in The Hill over the summer, when columnist John Solomon, whose articles informed Rudy Giuliani’s Biden-Ukraine investigation, published a piece in July claiming that Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s deputy said Firtash’s criminal charges in the U.S. might “go away” if he shared damaging information about Trump with Mueller’s team. Solomon cited “multiple sources with direct knowledge” and contemporaneous memos. Firtash and Solomon share the same lawyers: Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova. The husband-wife team are veterans of the conservative movement’s most contentious legal battles, with longstanding ties in the Justice Department and Trump administration. Ukrainian Oligarch Seethed About ‘Overlord’ Biden for YearsRead more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

He was undocumented. Now he&#39;s exposing detention center abuse,"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 17:49:46 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/undocumented-now-hes-exposing-detention-100018960.html,"Tom Wong, a UC San Diego professor, has surveyed 600 asylum seekers and says the president’s policy is ‘sending people to die’Tom Wong, a UC San Diego professor, is uncovering the abuse immigrants face in overcrowded detention facilities. Photograph: Erik Jepsen/UC San Diego PublicationsTom K Wong’s world shattered at age 16 in 1998 when his parents told him he was undocumented. The Riverside, California, teenager thought his life was over.Now 37, Wong is one of the prominent scholars in the US on immigration, most recently uncovering abuses inside detention centers in his latest University of California, San Diego research. The political science professor, whose family migrated from Hong Kong when he was two and overstayed their visas, released groundbreaking research on Tuesday on asylum seekers, exposing violence and suffering at the border as the Trump administration is escalating its crackdown on migrants.Wong surveyed more than 600 asylum seekers affected by Donald Trump’s controversial “remain in Mexico” policy, which has forced tens of thousands to return to Mexico while their cases advance. Roughly, 85% reported that immigration detention facilities failed to provide adequate food and water and that they were unable to sleep due to overcrowding, cold temperatures and other conditions. Only 20% reported being able to take care of basic hygiene, such as showering and brushing their teeth.More than half said they faced verbal abuse inside detention, with some saying they also suffered physical abuse. Roughly 25% also had their property seized when taken into detention, including important documents and cash that was not returned to them, he said.A majority said they were forced to return to Mexico without any further investigation of the violence they might face there, which Wong said was a direct violation of the policy.While waiting in Mexico, one out of four said they were threatened with physical violence, and more said they ended up homeless.Asked about Wong’s research, a spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) said the agency “provides safe, humane, clean, professionally run and appropriate conditions of confinement” and access to legal and translation services. A spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection, which also detains migrants, said it “takes allegations of mistreatment of individuals in our facilities seriously” and that employees found to violate standards “will be held accountable”.Wong talked with the Guardian about his non-traditional academic career, the crisis at the border, and how he uses his PhD to fight back. The conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.Can you tell me what it was like to discover you were undocumented?My parents told me I couldn’t go with my high school basketball team to Canada. Then they told me I couldn’t get a driver’s license. I couldn’t get a job. And there was just a cascade of no, no, no. And finally my parents said it’s not because we don’t want you to do these things, it’s because you can’t. All my hopes and dreams about growing up were literally shattered in a single moment. And it was during a time when there wasn’t the undocumented youth movement, so I wasn’t able to find other students.I grew up in a predominantly Latino neighborhood, and before I found out I was undocumented, California was becoming a ground zero for this emerging anti-immigrant movement. I remember there were policy debates with the white kids on one side, the brown kids on the other, and me feeling like I had little understanding. But everything that was being said negatively toward my Latino classmates actually applied more directly to me.How did you overcome this and become an academic?I barely graduated high school after learning I was undocumented, because at the time I thought, what’s the point? But I got married when I was 19 and I was able to adjust my immigration status. I paid for a summer politics class, and I thought if this professor can make a living teaching, maybe I can do the same.It took me years to realize I bring a different perspective to the study of immigration, politics and policy, that my history is my comparative advantage. It’s a perspective that helps me ask questions that others don’t. It took me a while to talk about my experience of being undocumented, because my parents’ immigration status was still tenuous. But they’re fine now, and I’m able to speak out.What has been most shocking to you about your findings on what happens to asylum seekers?Some findings were simultaneously shocking, but also very expected since we’ve heard anecdotal reports. There were over 200 incidents of verbal abuse, dozens of instances of physical abuse and even property being taken away. I heard of someone losing their life savings.The findings about language access also really stuck out. Individuals are getting instructions about critically important steps in languages that they don’t speak: often Central American asylum speakers who speak an indigenous language by default are given instructions in Spanish. In San Diego, there are a lot of different languages – Asian Indians seeking asylum who speak Hindi were given instructions in English or Spanish. I find it hard to believe that we as a country can’t find a Hindi speaker. This is a basic due process tenet.What do we now know about the conditions people face when they are forced to return to Mexico?So many have experienced or been threatened with physical violence while waiting. Despite the handshake agreement between the United States and Mexico that Mexico is responsible for the humanitarian needs of these asylum seekers being returned, we are putting people in harm’s way by returning them to Mexico.What do you think is most important for the public to understand about the impact of Trump’s policies on asylum seekers right now?This administration wants to see net zero refugee admissions, which we are getting close to. This is a core part of the agenda. It’s not just in disregard of international and domestic law, but it’s in disregard of the fact that so many of the asylum seekers who are being turned away are seeking protection from persecution. It’s an agenda that is blind to the experiences of these families. The inevitable result is that people will be sent to circumstances where they will likely die.What do you hope is the impact of your work and your findings?I used to believe in facts swaying public opinion. But I fear we are in a political moment where the ability to select which facts to consider true is making the work we do less important. Now it may be very difficult to move public opinion when opinions are formed on such a visceral level.But facts still matter. The truth still matters, because what is happening now is the administration is often acting first, and then the courts are litigating later. So even if the public is less and less swayed by the facts on the ground, judges still are.Were there moments in your career where you found academia unwelcoming?It can be strange having lived through something and then hearing about that subject through the perspective of somebody who studies the topic, but doesn’t have that personal connection. But I do quantitative work, and at the end of the day, the data speak much louder than my own personal background.What’s the hardest part of doing academic work that is relevant to urgent policy matters?A lot of academics are just scared about being wrong and being publicly wrong. But I believe in the importance of the work, and that means I need to be confident that I can stand by it. A few years ago I thought my bar was peer review in an academic journal. Now I understand my bar to be that as well as, “Can this pass muster with a federal judge or can this withstand a deposition from attorneys for the Department of Justice?”What effect does the work have on you personally?It’s often miserable. It’s difficult to hear. It’s difficult to interact with people, to see women and little kids who are the ages of my own children in shelters in Mexico, not knowing what’s going on. It is difficult to not internalize it. But I believe in the work. If it’s not me, I’m afraid there won’t be others who step up. Because it’ll be too easy for those others who want to step up to then step out after really understanding how difficult it is to have these conversations.How do you think we can get out of this crisis moment?We have to know our immigration policy past. Every generation gets to decide for itself, whether it embraces diversity through our immigration system or pushes it away by closing our golden door. We are defining for this generation how we are answering the question of what it means to be a nation of immigrants. And we have done that historically. And in some periods in our history, we have closed our doors to immigrants, and in other periods we have opened them again. This is cyclical. It is difficult to live through, but this has been a cyclical part of our immigration policy past.Every four years we as a country get to collectively answer whether or not we still believe in this idea that we are a nation of immigrants. In 2020, we will get to vote.",http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5mTp_BGJvUvwmexmBzFrEg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/9a0dd9c25d5ea0ca1353ff565b5c5106,He was undocumented.

What Baghdadi’s Death Means for al Qaeda—and Why It Matters,"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 13:14:08 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/baghdadi-death-means-al-qaeda-171408420.html,"SITE Intelligence GroupWith ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi killed one day and the group’s official spokesman Abu Hassan al-Muhajir the next, there’s a giant hole in the pseudo-Caliphate structure of the so-called Islamic State. The group must now, by its strict religious tenets, find a new (supposed) descendant of the Prophet Muhammed to fill the role of Caliph. But the deaths of those two are equally consequential for al-Qaeda, the bitter rival of ISIS for leadership of global jihad. Al-Qaeda has spent the last six years branding the Caliphate as illegitimate, too extreme, and ultimately harmful. When ISIS declared the establishment of its so-called Caliphate spanning territory in Syria and Iraq in 2014, al-Qaeda and its affiliates unanimously rejected it. To this day, al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri’s speeches rarely come without some critique of the “epidemic” put forth by ISIS.Trump Officials Had No Clue Where He Got ‘Whimpering’ Detail in His Baghdadi Raid AccountOddly, Baghdadi was killed in Idlib, a haven of al-Qaeda-linked fighters and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a Syrian Islamist faction led by Abu Muhammad al-Julani, a former al-Qaeda comrade who had become one of Baghdadi's most bitter foes. There has been some speculation Baghdadi was not just hiding out but trying to recruit from the ranks of his enemies.Neither al-Qaeda Central nor its affiliates have commented on Baghdadi’s death as yet, but within hours after the news broke, al-Qaeda ideologues and supporters already were celebrating the event and discussing what it will mean for the future of jihad. In chat groups online, al-Qaeda supporters voiced resentment after years of bitter strife with the group, and the scale of these responses illustrates just how much of a big deal and opportunity they see with Baghdadi’s death.“Based on his orders, thousands of the mujahideen were killed,” one post read.“How thrilled were they every time leaders from al-Qaeda were martyred?” read another.Some wished Baghdadi the ultimate condemnation:  “May Allah send him to Hell.”Messages by others, however, particularly al-Qaeda-linked ideologues, balanced expressions of justice for the jihadi movement with restraint, making sure not to celebrate excessively the result of an operation by the United States.The tactful enthusiasm is calculated. Many ISIS fighters, much of its military infrastructure, many media officials, and supporters were pulled from al-Qaeda. Now, with ISIS’ “Caliph” dead and that Caliphate itself destroyed, al-Qaeda has been given its biggest opportunity yet to bring many of them back under its tent. SITE Intelligence GroupPerhaps the most profound instance of this outreach was a lengthy essay by “Adel Amin,” the pen name of a prominent ideologue linked to the Shabaab al-Mujahideen Movement, al-Qaeda’s branch in Somalia and most powerful affiliate. The message, disseminated widely across al-Qaeda-supporting channels and chat groups (many of which are also frequented by pro-ISIS users), demanded that ISIS supporters “return to the road of righteousness” after the Islamic State, in all of its excessive aggression and delusions of destiny, has proven itself a failure. Amin wrote:The situation here is not one in which to gloat. It is a situation for reminding and calling on those who remained in the ranks of al-Baghdadi, to reconsider… Indeed, we witnessed its back being broken, its leaders getting killed, and its banner falling, and we hope that we can witness whoever remains from its soldiers returning to righteousness.Statements by other ideologues and supporters voiced the same points. A statement by Sirajuddin Zurayqat, a former religious official in the now-defunct al-Qaeda-linked Brigades of Abdullah Azzam in Lebanon, urged: “Now [Baghdadi] is dead and there is not one from the Ummah grieving over him or giving condolences... Therefore, those who were deceived by him should reconsider before it is too late!”These messages echo the same calls heard from Zawahiri and al-Qaeda affiliates over the years calling on ISIS fighters to “repent” and leave the group. Yet despite these new circumstances, ISIS supporters will not easily be moved. Since the summer of 2016, the group’s followers have seen the loss of the major cities Mosul in Iraq and Raqqah in Syria as well as the death of revered ISIS figures like Omar Shishani, Abu Muhammad al-‘Adnani, and others. With the latest setbacks to its leadership, ISIS-linked accounts online already have poured out calls to stay steadfast and have even used Baghdadi’s death as a rallying point to carry out new attacks. Reinforcing this undeterred support is an ISIS military and media machine that has shown no sign of stopping in the last two days.

Its attempts to bolster its image, already heavily weighed down by a less-than-charismatic leader in Zawahiri, were upended upon the death of Hamza bin Laden, the son of Osama, whom al-Qaeda likely was grooming for an eventual leadership position. These variables considered, al-Qaeda may not be the appealing alternative for jihadists that its supporters want it to seem.

The barriers between these terrorist organizations have only hardened over the years, fueling deadly clashes and jihadi PR wars.

He was undocumented. Now he&#39;s exposing detention center abuse,"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 17:49:46 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/undocumented-now-hes-exposing-detention-100018960.html,"Tom Wong, a UC San Diego professor, has surveyed 600 asylum seekers and says the president’s policy is ‘sending people to die’Tom Wong, a UC San Diego professor, is uncovering the abuse immigrants face in overcrowded detention facilities. Photograph: Erik Jepsen/UC San Diego PublicationsTom K Wong’s world shattered at age 16 in 1998 when his parents told him he was undocumented. The Riverside, California, teenager thought his life was over.Now 37, Wong is one of the prominent scholars in the US on immigration, most recently uncovering abuses inside detention centers in his latest University of California, San Diego research. The political science professor, whose family migrated from Hong Kong when he was two and overstayed their visas, released groundbreaking research on Tuesday on asylum seekers, exposing violence and suffering at the border as the Trump administration is escalating its crackdown on migrants.Wong surveyed more than 600 asylum seekers affected by Donald Trump’s controversial “remain in Mexico” policy, which has forced tens of thousands to return to Mexico while their cases advance. Roughly, 85% reported that immigration detention facilities failed to provide adequate food and water and that they were unable to sleep due to overcrowding, cold temperatures and other conditions. Only 20% reported being able to take care of basic hygiene, such as showering and brushing their teeth.More than half said they faced verbal abuse inside detention, with some saying they also suffered physical abuse. Roughly 25% also had their property seized when taken into detention, including important documents and cash that was not returned to them, he said.A majority said they were forced to return to Mexico without any further investigation of the violence they might face there, which Wong said was a direct violation of the policy.While waiting in Mexico, one out of four said they were threatened with physical violence, and more said they ended up homeless.Asked about Wong’s research, a spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) said the agency “provides safe, humane, clean, professionally run and appropriate conditions of confinement” and access to legal and translation services. A spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection, which also detains migrants, said it “takes allegations of mistreatment of individuals in our facilities seriously” and that employees found to violate standards “will be held accountable”.Wong talked with the Guardian about his non-traditional academic career, the crisis at the border, and how he uses his PhD to fight back. The conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.Can you tell me what it was like to discover you were undocumented?My parents told me I couldn’t go with my high school basketball team to Canada. Then they told me I couldn’t get a driver’s license. I couldn’t get a job. And there was just a cascade of no, no, no. And finally my parents said it’s not because we don’t want you to do these things, it’s because you can’t. All my hopes and dreams about growing up were literally shattered in a single moment. And it was during a time when there wasn’t the undocumented youth movement, so I wasn’t able to find other students.I grew up in a predominantly Latino neighborhood, and before I found out I was undocumented, California was becoming a ground zero for this emerging anti-immigrant movement. I remember there were policy debates with the white kids on one side, the brown kids on the other, and me feeling like I had little understanding. But everything that was being said negatively toward my Latino classmates actually applied more directly to me.How did you overcome this and become an academic?I barely graduated high school after learning I was undocumented, because at the time I thought, what’s the point? But I got married when I was 19 and I was able to adjust my immigration status. I paid for a summer politics class, and I thought if this professor can make a living teaching, maybe I can do the same.It took me years to realize I bring a different perspective to the study of immigration, politics and policy, that my history is my comparative advantage. It’s a perspective that helps me ask questions that others don’t. It took me a while to talk about my experience of being undocumented, because my parents’ immigration status was still tenuous. But they’re fine now, and I’m able to speak out.What has been most shocking to you about your findings on what happens to asylum seekers?Some findings were simultaneously shocking, but also very expected since we’ve heard anecdotal reports. There were over 200 incidents of verbal abuse, dozens of instances of physical abuse and even property being taken away. I heard of someone losing their life savings.The findings about language access also really stuck out. Individuals are getting instructions about critically important steps in languages that they don’t speak: often Central American asylum speakers who speak an indigenous language by default are given instructions in Spanish. In San Diego, there are a lot of different languages – Asian Indians seeking asylum who speak Hindi were given instructions in English or Spanish. I find it hard to believe that we as a country can’t find a Hindi speaker. This is a basic due process tenet.What do we now know about the conditions people face when they are forced to return to Mexico?So many have experienced or been threatened with physical violence while waiting. Despite the handshake agreement between the United States and Mexico that Mexico is responsible for the humanitarian needs of these asylum seekers being returned, we are putting people in harm’s way by returning them to Mexico.What do you think is most important for the public to understand about the impact of Trump’s policies on asylum seekers right now?This administration wants to see net zero refugee admissions, which we are getting close to. This is a core part of the agenda. It’s not just in disregard of international and domestic law, but it’s in disregard of the fact that so many of the asylum seekers who are being turned away are seeking protection from persecution. It’s an agenda that is blind to the experiences of these families. The inevitable result is that people will be sent to circumstances where they will likely die.What do you hope is the impact of your work and your findings?I used to believe in facts swaying public opinion. But I fear we are in a political moment where the ability to select which facts to consider true is making the work we do less important. Now it may be very difficult to move public opinion when opinions are formed on such a visceral level.But facts still matter. The truth still matters, because what is happening now is the administration is often acting first, and then the courts are litigating later. So even if the public is less and less swayed by the facts on the ground, judges still are.Were there moments in your career where you found academia unwelcoming?It can be strange having lived through something and then hearing about that subject through the perspective of somebody who studies the topic, but doesn’t have that personal connection. But I do quantitative work, and at the end of the day, the data speak much louder than my own personal background.What’s the hardest part of doing academic work that is relevant to urgent policy matters?A lot of academics are just scared about being wrong and being publicly wrong. But I believe in the importance of the work, and that means I need to be confident that I can stand by it. A few years ago I thought my bar was peer review in an academic journal. Now I understand my bar to be that as well as, “Can this pass muster with a federal judge or can this withstand a deposition from attorneys for the Department of Justice?”What effect does the work have on you personally?It’s often miserable. It’s difficult to hear. It’s difficult to interact with people, to see women and little kids who are the ages of my own children in shelters in Mexico, not knowing what’s going on. It is difficult to not internalize it. But I believe in the work. If it’s not me, I’m afraid there won’t be others who step up. Because it’ll be too easy for those others who want to step up to then step out after really understanding how difficult it is to have these conversations.How do you think we can get out of this crisis moment?We have to know our immigration policy past. Every generation gets to decide for itself, whether it embraces diversity through our immigration system or pushes it away by closing our golden door. We are defining for this generation how we are answering the question of what it means to be a nation of immigrants. And we have done that historically. And in some periods in our history, we have closed our doors to immigrants, and in other periods we have opened them again. This is cyclical. It is difficult to live through, but this has been a cyclical part of our immigration policy past.Every four years we as a country get to collectively answer whether or not we still believe in this idea that we are a nation of immigrants. In 2020, we will get to vote.",http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5mTp_BGJvUvwmexmBzFrEg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/9a0dd9c25d5ea0ca1353ff565b5c5106,He was undocumented.

What Baghdadi’s Death Means for al Qaeda—and Why It Matters,"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 13:14:08 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/baghdadi-death-means-al-qaeda-171408420.html,"SITE Intelligence GroupWith ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi killed one day and the group’s official spokesman Abu Hassan al-Muhajir the next, there’s a giant hole in the pseudo-Caliphate structure of the so-called Islamic State. The group must now, by its strict religious tenets, find a new (supposed) descendant of the Prophet Muhammed to fill the role of Caliph. But the deaths of those two are equally consequential for al-Qaeda, the bitter rival of ISIS for leadership of global jihad. Al-Qaeda has spent the last six years branding the Caliphate as illegitimate, too extreme, and ultimately harmful. When ISIS declared the establishment of its so-called Caliphate spanning territory in Syria and Iraq in 2014, al-Qaeda and its affiliates unanimously rejected it. To this day, al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri’s speeches rarely come without some critique of the “epidemic” put forth by ISIS.Trump Officials Had No Clue Where He Got ‘Whimpering’ Detail in His Baghdadi Raid AccountOddly, Baghdadi was killed in Idlib, a haven of al-Qaeda-linked fighters and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a Syrian Islamist faction led by Abu Muhammad al-Julani, a former al-Qaeda comrade who had become one of Baghdadi's most bitter foes. There has been some speculation Baghdadi was not just hiding out but trying to recruit from the ranks of his enemies.Neither al-Qaeda Central nor its affiliates have commented on Baghdadi’s death as yet, but within hours after the news broke, al-Qaeda ideologues and supporters already were celebrating the event and discussing what it will mean for the future of jihad. In chat groups online, al-Qaeda supporters voiced resentment after years of bitter strife with the group, and the scale of these responses illustrates just how much of a big deal and opportunity they see with Baghdadi’s death.“Based on his orders, thousands of the mujahideen were killed,” one post read.“How thrilled were they every time leaders from al-Qaeda were martyred?” read another.Some wished Baghdadi the ultimate condemnation:  “May Allah send him to Hell.”Messages by others, however, particularly al-Qaeda-linked ideologues, balanced expressions of justice for the jihadi movement with restraint, making sure not to celebrate excessively the result of an operation by the United States.The tactful enthusiasm is calculated. Many ISIS fighters, much of its military infrastructure, many media officials, and supporters were pulled from al-Qaeda. Now, with ISIS’ “Caliph” dead and that Caliphate itself destroyed, al-Qaeda has been given its biggest opportunity yet to bring many of them back under its tent. SITE Intelligence GroupPerhaps the most profound instance of this outreach was a lengthy essay by “Adel Amin,” the pen name of a prominent ideologue linked to the Shabaab al-Mujahideen Movement, al-Qaeda’s branch in Somalia and most powerful affiliate. The message, disseminated widely across al-Qaeda-supporting channels and chat groups (many of which are also frequented by pro-ISIS users), demanded that ISIS supporters “return to the road of righteousness” after the Islamic State, in all of its excessive aggression and delusions of destiny, has proven itself a failure. Amin wrote:The situation here is not one in which to gloat. It is a situation for reminding and calling on those who remained in the ranks of al-Baghdadi, to reconsider… Indeed, we witnessed its back being broken, its leaders getting killed, and its banner falling, and we hope that we can witness whoever remains from its soldiers returning to righteousness.Statements by other ideologues and supporters voiced the same points. A statement by Sirajuddin Zurayqat, a former religious official in the now-defunct al-Qaeda-linked Brigades of Abdullah Azzam in Lebanon, urged: “Now [Baghdadi] is dead and there is not one from the Ummah grieving over him or giving condolences... Therefore, those who were deceived by him should reconsider before it is too late!”These messages echo the same calls heard from Zawahiri and al-Qaeda affiliates over the years calling on ISIS fighters to “repent” and leave the group. Yet despite these new circumstances, ISIS supporters will not easily be moved. Since the summer of 2016, the group’s followers have seen the loss of the major cities Mosul in Iraq and Raqqah in Syria as well as the death of revered ISIS figures like Omar Shishani, Abu Muhammad al-‘Adnani, and others. With the latest setbacks to its leadership, ISIS-linked accounts online already have poured out calls to stay steadfast and have even used Baghdadi’s death as a rallying point to carry out new attacks. Reinforcing this undeterred support is an ISIS military and media machine that has shown no sign of stopping in the last two days. While ISIS has not yet officially acknowledged the death of Baghdadi, it has continued reporting on day-to-day military activity across Iraq, Syria, and the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.ISIS' Yemen Province - AQAP Prisoners as Featured in the video “He Who Starts is More Unjust”SITE Intelligence GroupFurthermore, while al-Qaeda affiliates like the Shabaab serve as powerful representatives of the organization, al-Qaeda Central is weaker than it has ever been.

The Riverside, California, teenager thought his life was over.Now 37, Wong is one of the prominent scholars in the US on immigration, most recently uncovering abuses inside detention centers in his latest University of California, San Diego research. The political science professor, whose family migrated from Hong Kong when he was two and overstayed their visas, released groundbreaking research on Tuesday on asylum seekers, exposing violence and suffering at the border as the Trump administration is escalating its crackdown on migrants.Wong surveyed more than 600 asylum seekers affected by Donald Trump’s controversial “remain in Mexico” policy, which has forced tens of thousands to return to Mexico while their cases advance. Roughly, 85% reported that immigration detention facilities failed to provide adequate food and water and that they were unable to sleep due to overcrowding, cold temperatures and other conditions. Only 20% reported being able to take care of basic hygiene, such as showering and brushing their teeth.More than half said they faced verbal abuse inside detention, with some saying they also suffered physical abuse. Roughly 25% also had their property seized when taken into detention, including important documents and cash that was not returned to them, he said.A majority said they were forced to return to Mexico without any further investigation of the violence they might face there, which Wong said was a direct violation of the policy.While waiting in Mexico, one out of four said they were threatened with physical violence, and more said they ended up homeless.Asked about Wong’s research, a spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) said the agency “provides safe, humane, clean, professionally run and appropriate conditions of confinement” and access to legal and translation services. A spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection, which also detains migrants, said it “takes allegations of mistreatment of individuals in our facilities seriously” and that employees found to violate standards “will be held accountable”.Wong talked with the Guardian about his non-traditional academic career, the crisis at the border, and how he uses his PhD to fight back. The conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.Can you tell me what it was like to discover you were undocumented?My parents told me I couldn’t go with my high school basketball team to Canada. Then they told me I couldn’t get a driver’s license. I couldn’t get a job. And there was just a cascade of no, no, no. And finally my parents said it’s not because we don’t want you to do these things, it’s because you can’t. All my hopes and dreams about growing up were literally shattered in a single moment. And it was during a time when there wasn’t the undocumented youth movement, so I wasn’t able to find other students.I grew up in a predominantly Latino neighborhood, and before I found out I was undocumented, California was becoming a ground zero for this emerging anti-immigrant movement. I remember there were policy debates with the white kids on one side, the brown kids on the other, and me feeling like I had little understanding. But everything that was being said negatively toward my Latino classmates actually applied more directly to me.How did you overcome this and become an academic?I barely graduated high school after learning I was undocumented, because at the time I thought, what’s the point? But I got married when I was 19 and I was able to adjust my immigration status. I paid for a summer politics class, and I thought if this professor can make a living teaching, maybe I can do the same.It took me years to realize I bring a different perspective to the study of immigration, politics and policy, that my history is my comparative advantage. It’s a perspective that helps me ask questions that others don’t. It took me a while to talk about my experience of being undocumented, because my parents’ immigration status was still tenuous. But they’re fine now, and I’m able to speak out.What has been most shocking to you about your findings on what happens to asylum seekers?Some findings were simultaneously shocking, but also very expected since we’ve heard anecdotal reports. There were over 200 incidents of verbal abuse, dozens of instances of physical abuse and even property being taken away. I heard of someone losing their life savings.The findings about language access also really stuck out. Individuals are getting instructions about critically important steps in languages that they don’t speak: often Central American asylum speakers who speak an indigenous language by default are given instructions in Spanish. In San Diego, there are a lot of different languages – Asian Indians seeking asylum who speak Hindi were given instructions in English or Spanish. I find it hard to believe that we as a country can’t find a Hindi speaker. This is a basic due process tenet.What do we now know about the conditions people face when they are forced to return to Mexico?So many have experienced or been threatened with physical violence while waiting. Despite the handshake agreement between the United States and Mexico that Mexico is responsible for the humanitarian needs of these asylum seekers being returned, we are putting people in harm’s way by returning them to Mexico.What do you think is most important for the public to understand about the impact of Trump’s policies on asylum seekers right now?This administration wants to see net zero refugee admissions, which we are getting close to. This is a core part of the agenda. It’s not just in disregard of international and domestic law, but it’s in disregard of the fact that so many of the asylum seekers who are being turned away are seeking protection from persecution. It’s an agenda that is blind to the experiences of these families. The inevitable result is that people will be sent to circumstances where they will likely die.What do you hope is the impact of your work and your findings?I used to believe in facts swaying public opinion. But I fear we are in a political moment where the ability to select which facts to consider true is making the work we do less important. Now it may be very difficult to move public opinion when opinions are formed on such a visceral level.But facts still matter. The truth still matters, because what is happening now is the administration is often acting first, and then the courts are litigating later. So even if the public is less and less swayed by the facts on the ground, judges still are.Were there moments in your career where you found academia unwelcoming?It can be strange having lived through something and then hearing about that subject through the perspective of somebody who studies the topic, but doesn’t have that personal connection. But I do quantitative work, and at the end of the day, the data speak much louder than my own personal background.What’s the hardest part of doing academic work that is relevant to urgent policy matters?A lot of academics are just scared about being wrong and being publicly wrong. But I believe in the importance of the work, and that means I need to be confident that I can stand by it. A few years ago I thought my bar was peer review in an academic journal. Now I understand my bar to be that as well as, “Can this pass muster with a federal judge or can this withstand a deposition from attorneys for the Department of Justice?”What effect does the work have on you personally?It’s often miserable. It’s difficult to hear. It’s difficult to interact with people, to see women and little kids who are the ages of my own children in shelters in Mexico, not knowing what’s going on. It is difficult to not internalize it. But I believe in the work. If it’s not me, I’m afraid there won’t be others who step up. Because it’ll be too easy for those others who want to step up to then step out after really understanding how difficult it is to have these conversations.How do you think we can get out of this crisis moment?We have to know our immigration policy past. Every generation gets to decide for itself, whether it embraces diversity through our immigration system or pushes it away by closing our golden door. We are defining for this generation how we are answering the question of what it means to be a nation of immigrants. And we have done that historically. And in some periods in our history, we have closed our doors to immigrants, and in other periods we have opened them again. This is cyclical. It is difficult to live through, but this has been a cyclical part of our immigration policy past.Every four years we as a country get to collectively answer whether or not we still believe in this idea that we are a nation of immigrants. In 2020, we will get to vote.",http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5mTp_BGJvUvwmexmBzFrEg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/9a0dd9c25d5ea0ca1353ff565b5c5106,He was undocumented.

Now he&#39;s exposing detention center abuse,"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 17:49:46 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/undocumented-now-hes-exposing-detention-100018960.html,"Tom Wong, a UC San Diego professor, has surveyed 600 asylum seekers and says the president’s policy is ‘sending people to die’Tom Wong, a UC San Diego professor, is uncovering the abuse immigrants face in overcrowded detention facilities. Photograph: Erik Jepsen/UC San Diego PublicationsTom K Wong’s world shattered at age 16 in 1998 when his parents told him he was undocumented. The Riverside, California, teenager thought his life was over.Now 37, Wong is one of the prominent scholars in the US on immigration, most recently uncovering abuses inside detention centers in his latest University of California, San Diego research. The political science professor, whose family migrated from Hong Kong when he was two and overstayed their visas, released groundbreaking research on Tuesday on asylum seekers, exposing violence and suffering at the border as the Trump administration is escalating its crackdown on migrants.Wong surveyed more than 600 asylum seekers affected by Donald Trump’s controversial “remain in Mexico” policy, which has forced tens of thousands to return to Mexico while their cases advance. Roughly, 85% reported that immigration detention facilities failed to provide adequate food and water and that they were unable to sleep due to overcrowding, cold temperatures and other conditions. Only 20% reported being able to take care of basic hygiene, such as showering and brushing their teeth.More than half said they faced verbal abuse inside detention, with some saying they also suffered physical abuse. Roughly 25% also had their property seized when taken into detention, including important documents and cash that was not returned to them, he said.A majority said they were forced to return to Mexico without any further investigation of the violence they might face there, which Wong said was a direct violation of the policy.While waiting in Mexico, one out of four said they were threatened with physical violence, and more said they ended up homeless.Asked about Wong’s research, a spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) said the agency “provides safe, humane, clean, professionally run and appropriate conditions of confinement” and access to legal and translation services. A spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection, which also detains migrants, said it “takes allegations of mistreatment of individuals in our facilities seriously” and that employees found to violate standards “will be held accountable”.Wong talked with the Guardian about his non-traditional academic career, the crisis at the border, and how he uses his PhD to fight back. The conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.Can you tell me what it was like to discover you were undocumented?My parents told me I couldn’t go with my high school basketball team to Canada. Then they told me I couldn’t get a driver’s license. I couldn’t get a job. And there was just a cascade of no, no, no. And finally my parents said it’s not because we don’t want you to do these things, it’s because you can’t. All my hopes and dreams about growing up were literally shattered in a single moment. And it was during a time when there wasn’t the undocumented youth movement, so I wasn’t able to find other students.I grew up in a predominantly Latino neighborhood, and before I found out I was undocumented, California was becoming a ground zero for this emerging anti-immigrant movement. I remember there were policy debates with the white kids on one side, the brown kids on the other, and me feeling like I had little understanding. But everything that was being said negatively toward my Latino classmates actually applied more directly to me.How did you overcome this and become an academic?I barely graduated high school after learning I was undocumented, because at the time I thought, what’s the point? But I got married when I was 19 and I was able to adjust my immigration status. I paid for a summer politics class, and I thought if this professor can make a living teaching, maybe I can do the same.It took me years to realize I bring a different perspective to the study of immigration, politics and policy, that my history is my comparative advantage. It’s a perspective that helps me ask questions that others don’t. It took me a while to talk about my experience of being undocumented, because my parents’ immigration status was still tenuous. But they’re fine now, and I’m able to speak out.What has been most shocking to you about your findings on what happens to asylum seekers?Some findings were simultaneously shocking, but also very expected since we’ve heard anecdotal reports. There were over 200 incidents of verbal abuse, dozens of instances of physical abuse and even property being taken away. I heard of someone losing their life savings.The findings about language access also really stuck out. Individuals are getting instructions about critically important steps in languages that they don’t speak: often Central American asylum speakers who speak an indigenous language by default are given instructions in Spanish. In San Diego, there are a lot of different languages – Asian Indians seeking asylum who speak Hindi were given instructions in English or Spanish. I find it hard to believe that we as a country can’t find a Hindi speaker. This is a basic due process tenet.What do we now know about the conditions people face when they are forced to return to Mexico?So many have experienced or been threatened with physical violence while waiting. Despite the handshake agreement between the United States and Mexico that Mexico is responsible for the humanitarian needs of these asylum seekers being returned, we are putting people in harm’s way by returning them to Mexico.What do you think is most important for the public to understand about the impact of Trump’s policies on asylum seekers right now?This administration wants to see net zero refugee admissions, which we are getting close to. This is a core part of the agenda. It’s not just in disregard of international and domestic law, but it’s in disregard of the fact that so many of the asylum seekers who are being turned away are seeking protection from persecution. It’s an agenda that is blind to the experiences of these families. The inevitable result is that people will be sent to circumstances where they will likely die.What do you hope is the impact of your work and your findings?I used to believe in facts swaying public opinion. But I fear we are in a political moment where the ability to select which facts to consider true is making the work we do less important. Now it may be very difficult to move public opinion when opinions are formed on such a visceral level.But facts still matter. The truth still matters, because what is happening now is the administration is often acting first, and then the courts are litigating later. So even if the public is less and less swayed by the facts on the ground, judges still are.Were there moments in your career where you found academia unwelcoming?It can be strange having lived through something and then hearing about that subject through the perspective of somebody who studies the topic, but doesn’t have that personal connection. But I do quantitative work, and at the end of the day, the data speak much louder than my own personal background.What’s the hardest part of doing academic work that is relevant to urgent policy matters?A lot of academics are just scared about being wrong and being publicly wrong. But I believe in the importance of the work, and that means I need to be confident that I can stand by it. A few years ago I thought my bar was peer review in an academic journal. Now I understand my bar to be that as well as, “Can this pass muster with a federal judge or can this withstand a deposition from attorneys for the Department of Justice?”What effect does the work have on you personally?It’s often miserable. It’s difficult to hear. It’s difficult to interact with people, to see women and little kids who are the ages of my own children in shelters in Mexico, not knowing what’s going on. It is difficult to not internalize it. But I believe in the work. If it’s not me, I’m afraid there won’t be others who step up. Because it’ll be too easy for those others who want to step up to then step out after really understanding how difficult it is to have these conversations.How do you think we can get out of this crisis moment?We have to know our immigration policy past. Every generation gets to decide for itself, whether it embraces diversity through our immigration system or pushes it away by closing our golden door. We are defining for this generation how we are answering the question of what it means to be a nation of immigrants. And we have done that historically. And in some periods in our history, we have closed our doors to immigrants, and in other periods we have opened them again. This is cyclical. It is difficult to live through, but this has been a cyclical part of our immigration policy past.Every four years we as a country get to collectively answer whether or not we still believe in this idea that we are a nation of immigrants. In 2020, we will get to vote.",http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5mTp_BGJvUvwmexmBzFrEg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/9a0dd9c25d5ea0ca1353ff565b5c5106,He was undocumented.

The political science professor, whose family migrated from Hong Kong when he was two and overstayed their visas, released groundbreaking research on Tuesday on asylum seekers, exposing violence and suffering at the border as the Trump administration is escalating its crackdown on migrants.Wong surveyed more than 600 asylum seekers affected by Donald Trump’s controversial “remain in Mexico” policy, which has forced tens of thousands to return to Mexico while their cases advance. Roughly, 85% reported that immigration detention facilities failed to provide adequate food and water and that they were unable to sleep due to overcrowding, cold temperatures and other conditions. Only 20% reported being able to take care of basic hygiene, such as showering and brushing their teeth.More than half said they faced verbal abuse inside detention, with some saying they also suffered physical abuse. Roughly 25% also had their property seized when taken into detention, including important documents and cash that was not returned to them, he said.A majority said they were forced to return to Mexico without any further investigation of the violence they might face there, which Wong said was a direct violation of the policy.While waiting in Mexico, one out of four said they were threatened with physical violence, and more said they ended up homeless.Asked about Wong’s research, a spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) said the agency “provides safe, humane, clean, professionally run and appropriate conditions of confinement” and access to legal and translation services. A spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection, which also detains migrants, said it “takes allegations of mistreatment of individuals in our facilities seriously” and that employees found to violate standards “will be held accountable”.Wong talked with the Guardian about his non-traditional academic career, the crisis at the border, and how he uses his PhD to fight back. The conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.Can you tell me what it was like to discover you were undocumented?My parents told me I couldn’t go with my high school basketball team to Canada. Then they told me I couldn’t get a driver’s license. I couldn’t get a job. And there was just a cascade of no, no, no. And finally my parents said it’s not because we don’t want you to do these things, it’s because you can’t. All my hopes and dreams about growing up were literally shattered in a single moment. And it was during a time when there wasn’t the undocumented youth movement, so I wasn’t able to find other students.I grew up in a predominantly Latino neighborhood, and before I found out I was undocumented, California was becoming a ground zero for this emerging anti-immigrant movement. I remember there were policy debates with the white kids on one side, the brown kids on the other, and me feeling like I had little understanding. But everything that was being said negatively toward my Latino classmates actually applied more directly to me.How did you overcome this and become an academic?I barely graduated high school after learning I was undocumented, because at the time I thought, what’s the point? But I got married when I was 19 and I was able to adjust my immigration status. I paid for a summer politics class, and I thought if this professor can make a living teaching, maybe I can do the same.It took me years to realize I bring a different perspective to the study of immigration, politics and policy, that my history is my comparative advantage. It’s a perspective that helps me ask questions that others don’t. It took me a while to talk about my experience of being undocumented, because my parents’ immigration status was still tenuous. But they’re fine now, and I’m able to speak out.What has been most shocking to you about your findings on what happens to asylum seekers?Some findings were simultaneously shocking, but also very expected since we’ve heard anecdotal reports. There were over 200 incidents of verbal abuse, dozens of instances of physical abuse and even property being taken away. I heard of someone losing their life savings.The findings about language access also really stuck out. Individuals are getting instructions about critically important steps in languages that they don’t speak: often Central American asylum speakers who speak an indigenous language by default are given instructions in Spanish. In San Diego, there are a lot of different languages – Asian Indians seeking asylum who speak Hindi were given instructions in English or Spanish. I find it hard to believe that we as a country can’t find a Hindi speaker. This is a basic due process tenet.What do we now know about the conditions people face when they are forced to return to Mexico?So many have experienced or been threatened with physical violence while waiting. Despite the handshake agreement between the United States and Mexico that Mexico is responsible for the humanitarian needs of these asylum seekers being returned, we are putting people in harm’s way by returning them to Mexico.What do you think is most important for the public to understand about the impact of Trump’s policies on asylum seekers right now?This administration wants to see net zero refugee admissions, which we are getting close to. This is a core part of the agenda. It’s not just in disregard of international and domestic law, but it’s in disregard of the fact that so many of the asylum seekers who are being turned away are seeking protection from persecution. It’s an agenda that is blind to the experiences of these families. The inevitable result is that people will be sent to circumstances where they will likely die.What do you hope is the impact of your work and your findings?I used to believe in facts swaying public opinion. But I fear we are in a political moment where the ability to select which facts to consider true is making the work we do less important. Now it may be very difficult to move public opinion when opinions are formed on such a visceral level.But facts still matter. The truth still matters, because what is happening now is the administration is often acting first, and then the courts are litigating later. So even if the public is less and less swayed by the facts on the ground, judges still are.Were there moments in your career where you found academia unwelcoming?It can be strange having lived through something and then hearing about that subject through the perspective of somebody who studies the topic, but doesn’t have that personal connection. But I do quantitative work, and at the end of the day, the data speak much louder than my own personal background.What’s the hardest part of doing academic work that is relevant to urgent policy matters?A lot of academics are just scared about being wrong and being publicly wrong. But I believe in the importance of the work, and that means I need to be confident that I can stand by it. A few years ago I thought my bar was peer review in an academic journal. Now I understand my bar to be that as well as, “Can this pass muster with a federal judge or can this withstand a deposition from attorneys for the Department of Justice?”What effect does the work have on you personally?It’s often miserable. It’s difficult to hear. It’s difficult to interact with people, to see women and little kids who are the ages of my own children in shelters in Mexico, not knowing what’s going on. It is difficult to not internalize it. But I believe in the work. If it’s not me, I’m afraid there won’t be others who step up. Because it’ll be too easy for those others who want to step up to then step out after really understanding how difficult it is to have these conversations.How do you think we can get out of this crisis moment?We have to know our immigration policy past. Every generation gets to decide for itself, whether it embraces diversity through our immigration system or pushes it away by closing our golden door. We are defining for this generation how we are answering the question of what it means to be a nation of immigrants. And we have done that historically. And in some periods in our history, we have closed our doors to immigrants, and in other periods we have opened them again. This is cyclical. It is difficult to live through, but this has been a cyclical part of our immigration policy past.Every four years we as a country get to collectively answer whether or not we still believe in this idea that we are a nation of immigrants. In 2020, we will get to vote.",http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5mTp_BGJvUvwmexmBzFrEg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/9a0dd9c25d5ea0ca1353ff565b5c5106,He was undocumented.

And finally my parents said it’s not because we don’t want you to do these things, it’s because you can’t. All my hopes and dreams about growing up were literally shattered in a single moment. And it was during a time when there wasn’t the undocumented youth movement, so I wasn’t able to find other students.I grew up in a predominantly Latino neighborhood, and before I found out I was undocumented, California was becoming a ground zero for this emerging anti-immigrant movement. I remember there were policy debates with the white kids on one side, the brown kids on the other, and me feeling like I had little understanding. But everything that was being said negatively toward my Latino classmates actually applied more directly to me.How did you overcome this and become an academic?I barely graduated high school after learning I was undocumented, because at the time I thought, what’s the point? But I got married when I was 19 and I was able to adjust my immigration status. I paid for a summer politics class, and I thought if this professor can make a living teaching, maybe I can do the same.It took me years to realize I bring a different perspective to the study of immigration, politics and policy, that my history is my comparative advantage. It’s a perspective that helps me ask questions that others don’t. It took me a while to talk about my experience of being undocumented, because my parents’ immigration status was still tenuous. But they’re fine now, and I’m able to speak out.What has been most shocking to you about your findings on what happens to asylum seekers?Some findings were simultaneously shocking, but also very expected since we’ve heard anecdotal reports. There were over 200 incidents of verbal abuse, dozens of instances of physical abuse and even property being taken away. I heard of someone losing their life savings.The findings about language access also really stuck out. Individuals are getting instructions about critically important steps in languages that they don’t speak: often Central American asylum speakers who speak an indigenous language by default are given instructions in Spanish. In San Diego, there are a lot of different languages – Asian Indians seeking asylum who speak Hindi were given instructions in English or Spanish. I find it hard to believe that we as a country can’t find a Hindi speaker. This is a basic due process tenet.What do we now know about the conditions people face when they are forced to return to Mexico?So many have experienced or been threatened with physical violence while waiting. Despite the handshake agreement between the United States and Mexico that Mexico is responsible for the humanitarian needs of these asylum seekers being returned, we are putting people in harm’s way by returning them to Mexico.What do you think is most important for the public to understand about the impact of Trump’s policies on asylum seekers right now?This administration wants to see net zero refugee admissions, which we are getting close to. This is a core part of the agenda. It’s not just in disregard of international and domestic law, but it’s in disregard of the fact that so many of the asylum seekers who are being turned away are seeking protection from persecution. It’s an agenda that is blind to the experiences of these families. The inevitable result is that people will be sent to circumstances where they will likely die.What do you hope is the impact of your work and your findings?I used to believe in facts swaying public opinion. But I fear we are in a political moment where the ability to select which facts to consider true is making the work we do less important. Now it may be very difficult to move public opinion when opinions are formed on such a visceral level.But facts still matter. The truth still matters, because what is happening now is the administration is often acting first, and then the courts are litigating later. So even if the public is less and less swayed by the facts on the ground, judges still are.Were there moments in your career where you found academia unwelcoming?It can be strange having lived through something and then hearing about that subject through the perspective of somebody who studies the topic, but doesn’t have that personal connection. But I do quantitative work, and at the end of the day, the data speak much louder than my own personal background.What’s the hardest part of doing academic work that is relevant to urgent policy matters?A lot of academics are just scared about being wrong and being publicly wrong. But I believe in the importance of the work, and that means I need to be confident that I can stand by it. A few years ago I thought my bar was peer review in an academic journal. Now I understand my bar to be that as well as, “Can this pass muster with a federal judge or can this withstand a deposition from attorneys for the Department of Justice?”What effect does the work have on you personally?It’s often miserable. It’s difficult to hear. It’s difficult to interact with people, to see women and little kids who are the ages of my own children in shelters in Mexico, not knowing what’s going on. It is difficult to not internalize it. But I believe in the work. If it’s not me, I’m afraid there won’t be others who step up. Because it’ll be too easy for those others who want to step up to then step out after really understanding how difficult it is to have these conversations.How do you think we can get out of this crisis moment?We have to know our immigration policy past. Every generation gets to decide for itself, whether it embraces diversity through our immigration system or pushes it away by closing our golden door. We are defining for this generation how we are answering the question of what it means to be a nation of immigrants. And we have done that historically. And in some periods in our history, we have closed our doors to immigrants, and in other periods we have opened them again. This is cyclical. It is difficult to live through, but this has been a cyclical part of our immigration policy past.Every four years we as a country get to collectively answer whether or not we still believe in this idea that we are a nation of immigrants. In 2020, we will get to vote.",http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5mTp_BGJvUvwmexmBzFrEg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/9a0dd9c25d5ea0ca1353ff565b5c5106,He was undocumented.

The Riverside, California, teenager thought his life was over.Now 37, Wong is one of the prominent scholars in the US on immigration, most recently uncovering abuses inside detention centers in his latest University of California, San Diego research. The political science professor, whose family migrated from Hong Kong when he was two and overstayed their visas, released groundbreaking research on Tuesday on asylum seekers, exposing violence and suffering at the border as the Trump administration is escalating its crackdown on migrants.Wong surveyed more than 600 asylum seekers affected by Donald Trump’s controversial “remain in Mexico” policy, which has forced tens of thousands to return to Mexico while their cases advance. Roughly, 85% reported that immigration detention facilities failed to provide adequate food and water and that they were unable to sleep due to overcrowding, cold temperatures and other conditions. Only 20% reported being able to take care of basic hygiene, such as showering and brushing their teeth.More than half said they faced verbal abuse inside detention, with some saying they also suffered physical abuse.

In San Diego, there are a lot of different languages – Asian Indians seeking asylum who speak Hindi were given instructions in English or Spanish. I find it hard to believe that we as a country can’t find a Hindi speaker. This is a basic due process tenet.What do we now know about the conditions people face when they are forced to return to Mexico?So many have experienced or been threatened with physical violence while waiting. Despite the handshake agreement between the United States and Mexico that Mexico is responsible for the humanitarian needs of these asylum seekers being returned, we are putting people in harm’s way by returning them to Mexico.What do you think is most important for the public to understand about the impact of Trump’s policies on asylum seekers right now?This administration wants to see net zero refugee admissions, which we are getting close to. This is a core part of the agenda. It’s not just in disregard of international and domestic law, but it’s in disregard of the fact that so many of the asylum seekers who are being turned away are seeking protection from persecution. It’s an agenda that is blind to the experiences of these families. The inevitable result is that people will be sent to circumstances where they will likely die.What do you hope is the impact of your work and your findings?I used to believe in facts swaying public opinion. But I fear we are in a political moment where the ability to select which facts to consider true is making the work we do less important. Now it may be very difficult to move public opinion when opinions are formed on such a visceral level.But facts still matter. The truth still matters, because what is happening now is the administration is often acting first, and then the courts are litigating later. So even if the public is less and less swayed by the facts on the ground, judges still are.Were there moments in your career where you found academia unwelcoming?It can be strange having lived through something and then hearing about that subject through the perspective of somebody who studies the topic, but doesn’t have that personal connection. But I do quantitative work, and at the end of the day, the data speak much louder than my own personal background.What’s the hardest part of doing academic work that is relevant to urgent policy matters?A lot of academics are just scared about being wrong and being publicly wrong. But I believe in the importance of the work, and that means I need to be confident that I can stand by it. A few years ago I thought my bar was peer review in an academic journal. Now I understand my bar to be that as well as, “Can this pass muster with a federal judge or can this withstand a deposition from attorneys for the Department of Justice?”What effect does the work have on you personally?It’s often miserable. It’s difficult to hear. It’s difficult to interact with people, to see women and little kids who are the ages of my own children in shelters in Mexico, not knowing what’s going on. It is difficult to not internalize it. But I believe in the work. If it’s not me, I’m afraid there won’t be others who step up. Because it’ll be too easy for those others who want to step up to then step out after really understanding how difficult it is to have these conversations.How do you think we can get out of this crisis moment?We have to know our immigration policy past. Every generation gets to decide for itself, whether it embraces diversity through our immigration system or pushes it away by closing our golden door. We are defining for this generation how we are answering the question of what it means to be a nation of immigrants. And we have done that historically. And in some periods in our history, we have closed our doors to immigrants, and in other periods we have opened them again. This is cyclical. It is difficult to live through, but this has been a cyclical part of our immigration policy past.Every four years we as a country get to collectively answer whether or not we still believe in this idea that we are a nation of immigrants. In 2020, we will get to vote.",http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5mTp_BGJvUvwmexmBzFrEg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/9a0dd9c25d5ea0ca1353ff565b5c5106,He was undocumented.

Photograph: Erik Jepsen/UC San Diego PublicationsTom K Wong’s world shattered at age 16 in 1998 when his parents told him he was undocumented. The Riverside, California, teenager thought his life was over.Now 37, Wong is one of the prominent scholars in the US on immigration, most recently uncovering abuses inside detention centers in his latest University of California, San Diego research. The political science professor, whose family migrated from Hong Kong when he was two and overstayed their visas, released groundbreaking research on Tuesday on asylum seekers, exposing violence and suffering at the border as the Trump administration is escalating its crackdown on migrants.Wong surveyed more than 600 asylum seekers affected by Donald Trump’s controversial “remain in Mexico” policy, which has forced tens of thousands to return to Mexico while their cases advance. Roughly, 85% reported that immigration detention facilities failed to provide adequate food and water and that they were unable to sleep due to overcrowding, cold temperatures and other conditions. Only 20% reported being able to take care of basic hygiene, such as showering and brushing their teeth.More than half said they faced verbal abuse inside detention, with some saying they also suffered physical abuse. Roughly 25% also had their property seized when taken into detention, including important documents and cash that was not returned to them, he said.A majority said they were forced to return to Mexico without any further investigation of the violence they might face there, which Wong said was a direct violation of the policy.While waiting in Mexico, one out of four said they were threatened with physical violence, and more said they ended up homeless.Asked about Wong’s research, a spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) said the agency “provides safe, humane, clean, professionally run and appropriate conditions of confinement” and access to legal and translation services. A spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection, which also detains migrants, said it “takes allegations of mistreatment of individuals in our facilities seriously” and that employees found to violate standards “will be held accountable”.Wong talked with the Guardian about his non-traditional academic career, the crisis at the border, and how he uses his PhD to fight back. The conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.Can you tell me what it was like to discover you were undocumented?My parents told me I couldn’t go with my high school basketball team to Canada. Then they told me I couldn’t get a driver’s license. I couldn’t get a job. And there was just a cascade of no, no, no. And finally my parents said it’s not because we don’t want you to do these things, it’s because you can’t. All my hopes and dreams about growing up were literally shattered in a single moment. And it was during a time when there wasn’t the undocumented youth movement, so I wasn’t able to find other students.I grew up in a predominantly Latino neighborhood, and before I found out I was undocumented, California was becoming a ground zero for this emerging anti-immigrant movement. I remember there were policy debates with the white kids on one side, the brown kids on the other, and me feeling like I had little understanding. But everything that was being said negatively toward my Latino classmates actually applied more directly to me.How did you overcome this and become an academic?I barely graduated high school after learning I was undocumented, because at the time I thought, what’s the point? But I got married when I was 19 and I was able to adjust my immigration status. I paid for a summer politics class, and I thought if this professor can make a living teaching, maybe I can do the same.It took me years to realize I bring a different perspective to the study of immigration, politics and policy, that my history is my comparative advantage. It’s a perspective that helps me ask questions that others don’t. It took me a while to talk about my experience of being undocumented, because my parents’ immigration status was still tenuous. But they’re fine now, and I’m able to speak out.What has been most shocking to you about your findings on what happens to asylum seekers?Some findings were simultaneously shocking, but also very expected since we’ve heard anecdotal reports. There were over 200 incidents of verbal abuse, dozens of instances of physical abuse and even property being taken away. I heard of someone losing their life savings.The findings about language access also really stuck out. Individuals are getting instructions about critically important steps in languages that they don’t speak: often Central American asylum speakers who speak an indigenous language by default are given instructions in Spanish.

I paid for a summer politics class, and I thought if this professor can make a living teaching, maybe I can do the same.It took me years to realize I bring a different perspective to the study of immigration, politics and policy, that my history is my comparative advantage. It’s a perspective that helps me ask questions that others don’t. It took me a while to talk about my experience of being undocumented, because my parents’ immigration status was still tenuous. But they’re fine now, and I’m able to speak out.What has been most shocking to you about your findings on what happens to asylum seekers?Some findings were simultaneously shocking, but also very expected since we’ve heard anecdotal reports. There were over 200 incidents of verbal abuse, dozens of instances of physical abuse and even property being taken away. I heard of someone losing their life savings.The findings about language access also really stuck out. Individuals are getting instructions about critically important steps in languages that they don’t speak: often Central American asylum speakers who speak an indigenous language by default are given instructions in Spanish. In San Diego, there are a lot of different languages – Asian Indians seeking asylum who speak Hindi were given instructions in English or Spanish. I find it hard to believe that we as a country can’t find a Hindi speaker. This is a basic due process tenet.What do we now know about the conditions people face when they are forced to return to Mexico?So many have experienced or been threatened with physical violence while waiting. Despite the handshake agreement between the United States and Mexico that Mexico is responsible for the humanitarian needs of these asylum seekers being returned, we are putting people in harm’s way by returning them to Mexico.What do you think is most important for the public to understand about the impact of Trump’s policies on asylum seekers right now?This administration wants to see net zero refugee admissions, which we are getting close to. This is a core part of the agenda. It’s not just in disregard of international and domestic law, but it’s in disregard of the fact that so many of the asylum seekers who are being turned away are seeking protection from persecution. It’s an agenda that is blind to the experiences of these families. The inevitable result is that people will be sent to circumstances where they will likely die.What do you hope is the impact of your work and your findings?I used to believe in facts swaying public opinion. But I fear we are in a political moment where the ability to select which facts to consider true is making the work we do less important. Now it may be very difficult to move public opinion when opinions are formed on such a visceral level.But facts still matter. The truth still matters, because what is happening now is the administration is often acting first, and then the courts are litigating later. So even if the public is less and less swayed by the facts on the ground, judges still are.Were there moments in your career where you found academia unwelcoming?It can be strange having lived through something and then hearing about that subject through the perspective of somebody who studies the topic, but doesn’t have that personal connection. But I do quantitative work, and at the end of the day, the data speak much louder than my own personal background.What’s the hardest part of doing academic work that is relevant to urgent policy matters?A lot of academics are just scared about being wrong and being publicly wrong. But I believe in the importance of the work, and that means I need to be confident that I can stand by it. A few years ago I thought my bar was peer review in an academic journal. Now I understand my bar to be that as well as, “Can this pass muster with a federal judge or can this withstand a deposition from attorneys for the Department of Justice?”What effect does the work have on you personally?It’s often miserable. It’s difficult to hear. It’s difficult to interact with people, to see women and little kids who are the ages of my own children in shelters in Mexico, not knowing what’s going on. It is difficult to not internalize it. But I believe in the work. If it’s not me, I’m afraid there won’t be others who step up. Because it’ll be too easy for those others who want to step up to then step out after really understanding how difficult it is to have these conversations.How do you think we can get out of this crisis moment?We have to know our immigration policy past. Every generation gets to decide for itself, whether it embraces diversity through our immigration system or pushes it away by closing our golden door. We are defining for this generation how we are answering the question of what it means to be a nation of immigrants. And we have done that historically. And in some periods in our history, we have closed our doors to immigrants, and in other periods we have opened them again. This is cyclical. It is difficult to live through, but this has been a cyclical part of our immigration policy past.Every four years we as a country get to collectively answer whether or not we still believe in this idea that we are a nation of immigrants. In 2020, we will get to vote.",http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5mTp_BGJvUvwmexmBzFrEg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/9a0dd9c25d5ea0ca1353ff565b5c5106,He was undocumented.

He was undocumented.

Photograph: Erik Jepsen/UC San Diego PublicationsTom K Wong’s world shattered at age 16 in 1998 when his parents told him he was undocumented. The Riverside, California, teenager thought his life was over.Now 37, Wong is one of the prominent scholars in the US on immigration, most recently uncovering abuses inside detention centers in his latest University of California, San Diego research. The political science professor, whose family migrated from Hong Kong when he was two and overstayed their visas, released groundbreaking research on Tuesday on asylum seekers, exposing violence and suffering at the border as the Trump administration is escalating its crackdown on migrants.Wong surveyed more than 600 asylum seekers affected by Donald Trump’s controversial “remain in Mexico” policy, which has forced tens of thousands to return to Mexico while their cases advance. Roughly, 85% reported that immigration detention facilities failed to provide adequate food and water and that they were unable to sleep due to overcrowding, cold temperatures and other conditions. Only 20% reported being able to take care of basic hygiene, such as showering and brushing their teeth.More than half said they faced verbal abuse inside detention, with some saying they also suffered physical abuse. Roughly 25% also had their property seized when taken into detention, including important documents and cash that was not returned to them, he said.A majority said they were forced to return to Mexico without any further investigation of the violence they might face there, which Wong said was a direct violation of the policy.While waiting in Mexico, one out of four said they were threatened with physical violence, and more said they ended up homeless.Asked about Wong’s research, a spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) said the agency “provides safe, humane, clean, professionally run and appropriate conditions of confinement” and access to legal and translation services. A spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection, which also detains migrants, said it “takes allegations of mistreatment of individuals in our facilities seriously” and that employees found to violate standards “will be held accountable”.Wong talked with the Guardian about his non-traditional academic career, the crisis at the border, and how he uses his PhD to fight back. The conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.Can you tell me what it was like to discover you were undocumented?My parents told me I couldn’t go with my high school basketball team to Canada. Then they told me I couldn’t get a driver’s license. I couldn’t get a job. And there was just a cascade of no, no, no. And finally my parents said it’s not because we don’t want you to do these things, it’s because you can’t. All my hopes and dreams about growing up were literally shattered in a single moment. And it was during a time when there wasn’t the undocumented youth movement, so I wasn’t able to find other students.I grew up in a predominantly Latino neighborhood, and before I found out I was undocumented, California was becoming a ground zero for this emerging anti-immigrant movement. I remember there were policy debates with the white kids on one side, the brown kids on the other, and me feeling like I had little understanding. But everything that was being said negatively toward my Latino classmates actually applied more directly to me.How did you overcome this and become an academic?I barely graduated high school after learning I was undocumented, because at the time I thought, what’s the point? But I got married when I was 19 and I was able to adjust my immigration status. I paid for a summer politics class, and I thought if this professor can make a living teaching, maybe I can do the same.It took me years to realize I bring a different perspective to the study of immigration, politics and policy, that my history is my comparative advantage. It’s a perspective that helps me ask questions that others don’t. It took me a while to talk about my experience of being undocumented, because my parents’ immigration status was still tenuous. But they’re fine now, and I’m able to speak out.What has been most shocking to you about your findings on what happens to asylum seekers?Some findings were simultaneously shocking, but also very expected since we’ve heard anecdotal reports. There were over 200 incidents of verbal abuse, dozens of instances of physical abuse and even property being taken away. I heard of someone losing their life savings.The findings about language access also really stuck out. Individuals are getting instructions about critically important steps in languages that they don’t speak: often Central American asylum speakers who speak an indigenous language by default are given instructions in Spanish. In San Diego, there are a lot of different languages – Asian Indians seeking asylum who speak Hindi were given instructions in English or Spanish. I find it hard to believe that we as a country can’t find a Hindi speaker. This is a basic due process tenet.What do we now know about the conditions people face when they are forced to return to Mexico?So many have experienced or been threatened with physical violence while waiting. Despite the handshake agreement between the United States and Mexico that Mexico is responsible for the humanitarian needs of these asylum seekers being returned, we are putting people in harm’s way by returning them to Mexico.What do you think is most important for the public to understand about the impact of Trump’s policies on asylum seekers right now?This administration wants to see net zero refugee admissions, which we are getting close to. This is a core part of the agenda. It’s not just in disregard of international and domestic law, but it’s in disregard of the fact that so many of the asylum seekers who are being turned away are seeking protection from persecution. It’s an agenda that is blind to the experiences of these families. The inevitable result is that people will be sent to circumstances where they will likely die.What do you hope is the impact of your work and your findings?I used to believe in facts swaying public opinion. But I fear we are in a political moment where the ability to select which facts to consider true is making the work we do less important. Now it may be very difficult to move public opinion when opinions are formed on such a visceral level.But facts still matter. The truth still matters, because what is happening now is the administration is often acting first, and then the courts are litigating later. So even if the public is less and less swayed by the facts on the ground, judges still are.Were there moments in your career where you found academia unwelcoming?It can be strange having lived through something and then hearing about that subject through the perspective of somebody who studies the topic, but doesn’t have that personal connection. But I do quantitative work, and at the end of the day, the data speak much louder than my own personal background.What’s the hardest part of doing academic work that is relevant to urgent policy matters?A lot of academics are just scared about being wrong and being publicly wrong. But I believe in the importance of the work, and that means I need to be confident that I can stand by it. A few years ago I thought my bar was peer review in an academic journal. Now I understand my bar to be that as well as, “Can this pass muster with a federal judge or can this withstand a deposition from attorneys for the Department of Justice?”What effect does the work have on you personally?It’s often miserable.

Roughly 25% also had their property seized when taken into detention, including important documents and cash that was not returned to them, he said.A majority said they were forced to return to Mexico without any further investigation of the violence they might face there, which Wong said was a direct violation of the policy.While waiting in Mexico, one out of four said they were threatened with physical violence, and more said they ended up homeless.Asked about Wong’s research, a spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) said the agency “provides safe, humane, clean, professionally run and appropriate conditions of confinement” and access to legal and translation services. A spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection, which also detains migrants, said it “takes allegations of mistreatment of individuals in our facilities seriously” and that employees found to violate standards “will be held accountable”.Wong talked with the Guardian about his non-traditional academic career, the crisis at the border, and how he uses his PhD to fight back. The conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.Can you tell me what it was like to discover you were undocumented?My parents told me I couldn’t go with my high school basketball team to Canada. Then they told me I couldn’t get a driver’s license. I couldn’t get a job. And there was just a cascade of no, no, no. And finally my parents said it’s not because we don’t want you to do these things, it’s because you can’t. All my hopes and dreams about growing up were literally shattered in a single moment. And it was during a time when there wasn’t the undocumented youth movement, so I wasn’t able to find other students.I grew up in a predominantly Latino neighborhood, and before I found out I was undocumented, California was becoming a ground zero for this emerging anti-immigrant movement. I remember there were policy debates with the white kids on one side, the brown kids on the other, and me feeling like I had little understanding. But everything that was being said negatively toward my Latino classmates actually applied more directly to me.How did you overcome this and become an academic?I barely graduated high school after learning I was undocumented, because at the time I thought, what’s the point? But I got married when I was 19 and I was able to adjust my immigration status. I paid for a summer politics class, and I thought if this professor can make a living teaching, maybe I can do the same.It took me years to realize I bring a different perspective to the study of immigration, politics and policy, that my history is my comparative advantage. It’s a perspective that helps me ask questions that others don’t. It took me a while to talk about my experience of being undocumented, because my parents’ immigration status was still tenuous. But they’re fine now, and I’m able to speak out.What has been most shocking to you about your findings on what happens to asylum seekers?Some findings were simultaneously shocking, but also very expected since we’ve heard anecdotal reports. There were over 200 incidents of verbal abuse, dozens of instances of physical abuse and even property being taken away. I heard of someone losing their life savings.The findings about language access also really stuck out. Individuals are getting instructions about critically important steps in languages that they don’t speak: often Central American asylum speakers who speak an indigenous language by default are given instructions in Spanish. In San Diego, there are a lot of different languages – Asian Indians seeking asylum who speak Hindi were given instructions in English or Spanish. I find it hard to believe that we as a country can’t find a Hindi speaker. This is a basic due process tenet.What do we now know about the conditions people face when they are forced to return to Mexico?So many have experienced or been threatened with physical violence while waiting. Despite the handshake agreement between the United States and Mexico that Mexico is responsible for the humanitarian needs of these asylum seekers being returned, we are putting people in harm’s way by returning them to Mexico.What do you think is most important for the public to understand about the impact of Trump’s policies on asylum seekers right now?This administration wants to see net zero refugee admissions, which we are getting close to. This is a core part of the agenda. It’s not just in disregard of international and domestic law, but it’s in disregard of the fact that so many of the asylum seekers who are being turned away are seeking protection from persecution. It’s an agenda that is blind to the experiences of these families. The inevitable result is that people will be sent to circumstances where they will likely die.What do you hope is the impact of your work and your findings?I used to believe in facts swaying public opinion. But I fear we are in a political moment where the ability to select which facts to consider true is making the work we do less important. Now it may be very difficult to move public opinion when opinions are formed on such a visceral level.But facts still matter. The truth still matters, because what is happening now is the administration is often acting first, and then the courts are litigating later. So even if the public is less and less swayed by the facts on the ground, judges still are.Were there moments in your career where you found academia unwelcoming?It can be strange having lived through something and then hearing about that subject through the perspective of somebody who studies the topic, but doesn’t have that personal connection. But I do quantitative work, and at the end of the day, the data speak much louder than my own personal background.What’s the hardest part of doing academic work that is relevant to urgent policy matters?A lot of academics are just scared about being wrong and being publicly wrong. But I believe in the importance of the work, and that means I need to be confident that I can stand by it. A few years ago I thought my bar was peer review in an academic journal. Now I understand my bar to be that as well as, “Can this pass muster with a federal judge or can this withstand a deposition from attorneys for the Department of Justice?”What effect does the work have on you personally?It’s often miserable. It’s difficult to hear. It’s difficult to interact with people, to see women and little kids who are the ages of my own children in shelters in Mexico, not knowing what’s going on. It is difficult to not internalize it. But I believe in the work. If it’s not me, I’m afraid there won’t be others who step up. Because it’ll be too easy for those others who want to step up to then step out after really understanding how difficult it is to have these conversations.How do you think we can get out of this crisis moment?We have to know our immigration policy past. Every generation gets to decide for itself, whether it embraces diversity through our immigration system or pushes it away by closing our golden door. We are defining for this generation how we are answering the question of what it means to be a nation of immigrants. And we have done that historically. And in some periods in our history, we have closed our doors to immigrants, and in other periods we have opened them again. This is cyclical. It is difficult to live through, but this has been a cyclical part of our immigration policy past.Every four years we as a country get to collectively answer whether or not we still believe in this idea that we are a nation of immigrants. In 2020, we will get to vote.",http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5mTp_BGJvUvwmexmBzFrEg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/9a0dd9c25d5ea0ca1353ff565b5c5106,He was undocumented.

What Baghdadi’s Death Means for al Qaeda—and Why It Matters,"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 13:14:08 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/baghdadi-death-means-al-qaeda-171408420.html,"SITE Intelligence GroupWith ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi killed one day and the group’s official spokesman Abu Hassan al-Muhajir the next, there’s a giant hole in the pseudo-Caliphate structure of the so-called Islamic State. The group must now, by its strict religious tenets, find a new (supposed) descendant of the Prophet Muhammed to fill the role of Caliph. But the deaths of those two are equally consequential for al-Qaeda, the bitter rival of ISIS for leadership of global jihad. Al-Qaeda has spent the last six years branding the Caliphate as illegitimate, too extreme, and ultimately harmful. When ISIS declared the establishment of its so-called Caliphate spanning territory in Syria and Iraq in 2014, al-Qaeda and its affiliates unanimously rejected it. To this day, al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri’s speeches rarely come without some critique of the “epidemic” put forth by ISIS.Trump Officials Had No Clue Where He Got ‘Whimpering’ Detail in His Baghdadi Raid AccountOddly, Baghdadi was killed in Idlib, a haven of al-Qaeda-linked fighters and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a Syrian Islamist faction led by Abu Muhammad al-Julani, a former al-Qaeda comrade who had become one of Baghdadi's most bitter foes. There has been some speculation Baghdadi was not just hiding out but trying to recruit from the ranks of his enemies.Neither al-Qaeda Central nor its affiliates have commented on Baghdadi’s death as yet, but within hours after the news broke, al-Qaeda ideologues and supporters already were celebrating the event and discussing what it will mean for the future of jihad. In chat groups online, al-Qaeda supporters voiced resentment after years of bitter strife with the group, and the scale of these responses illustrates just how much of a big deal and opportunity they see with Baghdadi’s death.“Based on his orders, thousands of the mujahideen were killed,” one post read.“How thrilled were they every time leaders from al-Qaeda were martyred?” read another.Some wished Baghdadi the ultimate condemnation:  “May Allah send him to Hell.”Messages by others, however, particularly al-Qaeda-linked ideologues, balanced expressions of justice for the jihadi movement with restraint, making sure not to celebrate excessively the result of an operation by the United States.The tactful enthusiasm is calculated. Many ISIS fighters, much of its military infrastructure, many media officials, and supporters were pulled from al-Qaeda. Now, with ISIS’ “Caliph” dead and that Caliphate itself destroyed, al-Qaeda has been given its biggest opportunity yet to bring many of them back under its tent. SITE Intelligence GroupPerhaps the most profound instance of this outreach was a lengthy essay by “Adel Amin,” the pen name of a prominent ideologue linked to the Shabaab al-Mujahideen Movement, al-Qaeda’s branch in Somalia and most powerful affiliate. The message, disseminated widely across al-Qaeda-supporting channels and chat groups (many of which are also frequented by pro-ISIS users), demanded that ISIS supporters “return to the road of righteousness” after the Islamic State, in all of its excessive aggression and delusions of destiny, has proven itself a failure. Amin wrote:The situation here is not one in which to gloat. It is a situation for reminding and calling on those who remained in the ranks of al-Baghdadi, to reconsider… Indeed, we witnessed its back being broken, its leaders getting killed, and its banner falling, and we hope that we can witness whoever remains from its soldiers returning to righteousness.Statements by other ideologues and supporters voiced the same points. A statement by Sirajuddin Zurayqat, a former religious official in the now-defunct al-Qaeda-linked Brigades of Abdullah Azzam in Lebanon, urged: “Now [Baghdadi] is dead and there is not one from the Ummah grieving over him or giving condolences... Therefore, those who were deceived by him should reconsider before it is too late!”These messages echo the same calls heard from Zawahiri and al-Qaeda affiliates over the years calling on ISIS fighters to “repent” and leave the group. Yet despite these new circumstances, ISIS supporters will not easily be moved. Since the summer of 2016, the group’s followers have seen the loss of the major cities Mosul in Iraq and Raqqah in Syria as well as the death of revered ISIS figures like Omar Shishani, Abu Muhammad al-‘Adnani, and others. With the latest setbacks to its leadership, ISIS-linked accounts online already have poured out calls to stay steadfast and have even used Baghdadi’s death as a rallying point to carry out new attacks. Reinforcing this undeterred support is an ISIS military and media machine that has shown no sign of stopping in the last two days. While ISIS has not yet officially acknowledged the death of Baghdadi, it has continued reporting on day-to-day military activity across Iraq, Syria, and the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.ISIS' Yemen Province - AQAP Prisoners as Featured in the video “He Who Starts is More Unjust”SITE Intelligence GroupFurthermore, while al-Qaeda affiliates like the Shabaab serve as powerful representatives of the organization, al-Qaeda Central is weaker than it has ever been. These days, al-Qaeda Central’s role is largely symbolic, limited to leadership messages and other content while steering the big-picture ethos of the organization. Its attempts to bolster its image, already heavily weighed down by a less-than-charismatic leader in Zawahiri, were upended upon the death of Hamza bin Laden, the son of Osama, whom al-Qaeda likely was grooming for an eventual leadership position. These variables considered, al-Qaeda may not be the appealing alternative for jihadists that its supporters want it to seem. So, while some fighters might very well join the ranks of al-Qaeda affiliates in their region, we shouldn't expect to see any drastic migration from ISIS’ ranks into its rival’s.Despite any notions of good-riddance that al-Qaeda and its supporters attach to Baghdadi’s death, and for whatever number of defectors it may win over as a result of Baghdadi’s demise, ISIS is not going anywhere. The barriers between these terrorist organizations have only hardened over the years, fueling deadly clashes and jihadi PR wars. Baghdadi was not the sole barrier keeping ISIS members from joining al-Qaeda, and his death is unlikely to diminish existing disputes.How U.S. Commandos IDed a ‘Mutilated’ Baghdadi So QuicklyRead more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

But even his claim now, that Republicans can ask questions, has been undermined, because now he’s directing witnesses not to answer questions that he doesn’t want the witness to answer, if they’re asked by Republicans.“He’s not cut off one Democrat, he’s not interrupted one Democrat and told a witness not to answer Democrat members’ questions, but today he started telling the witness not to answer questions by certain Republicans. That reeks.”House Republicans have been hostile to Schiff’s handling of the impeachment probe, and last week attempted to pass a resolution to censure the California Democrat and demanded his resignation.

The Riverside, California, teenager thought his life was over.Now 37, Wong is one of the prominent scholars in the US on immigration, most recently uncovering abuses inside detention centers in his latest University of California, San Diego research. The political science professor, whose family migrated from Hong Kong when he was two and overstayed their visas, released groundbreaking research on Tuesday on asylum seekers, exposing violence and suffering at the border as the Trump administration is escalating its crackdown on migrants.Wong surveyed more than 600 asylum seekers affected by Donald Trump’s controversial “remain in Mexico” policy, which has forced tens of thousands to return to Mexico while their cases advance. Roughly, 85% reported that immigration detention facilities failed to provide adequate food and water and that they were unable to sleep due to overcrowding, cold temperatures and other conditions. Only 20% reported being able to take care of basic hygiene, such as showering and brushing their teeth.More than half said they faced verbal abuse inside detention, with some saying they also suffered physical abuse. Roughly 25% also had their property seized when taken into detention, including important documents and cash that was not returned to them, he said.A majority said they were forced to return to Mexico without any further investigation of the violence they might face there, which Wong said was a direct violation of the policy.While waiting in Mexico, one out of four said they were threatened with physical violence, and more said they ended up homeless.Asked about Wong’s research, a spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) said the agency “provides safe, humane, clean, professionally run and appropriate conditions of confinement” and access to legal and translation services.

What Baghdadi’s Death Means for al Qaeda—and Why It Matters,"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 13:14:08 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/baghdadi-death-means-al-qaeda-171408420.html,"SITE Intelligence GroupWith ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi killed one day and the group’s official spokesman Abu Hassan al-Muhajir the next, there’s a giant hole in the pseudo-Caliphate structure of the so-called Islamic State. The group must now, by its strict religious tenets, find a new (supposed) descendant of the Prophet Muhammed to fill the role of Caliph. But the deaths of those two are equally consequential for al-Qaeda, the bitter rival of ISIS for leadership of global jihad. Al-Qaeda has spent the last six years branding the Caliphate as illegitimate, too extreme, and ultimately harmful. When ISIS declared the establishment of its so-called Caliphate spanning territory in Syria and Iraq in 2014, al-Qaeda and its affiliates unanimously rejected it. To this day, al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri’s speeches rarely come without some critique of the “epidemic” put forth by ISIS.Trump Officials Had No Clue Where He Got ‘Whimpering’ Detail in His Baghdadi Raid AccountOddly, Baghdadi was killed in Idlib, a haven of al-Qaeda-linked fighters and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a Syrian Islamist faction led by Abu Muhammad al-Julani, a former al-Qaeda comrade who had become one of Baghdadi's most bitter foes. There has been some speculation Baghdadi was not just hiding out but trying to recruit from the ranks of his enemies.Neither al-Qaeda Central nor its affiliates have commented on Baghdadi’s death as yet, but within hours after the news broke, al-Qaeda ideologues and supporters already were celebrating the event and discussing what it will mean for the future of jihad. In chat groups online, al-Qaeda supporters voiced resentment after years of bitter strife with the group, and the scale of these responses illustrates just how much of a big deal and opportunity they see with Baghdadi’s death.“Based on his orders, thousands of the mujahideen were killed,” one post read.“How thrilled were they every time leaders from al-Qaeda were martyred?” read another.Some wished Baghdadi the ultimate condemnation:  “May Allah send him to Hell.”Messages by others, however, particularly al-Qaeda-linked ideologues, balanced expressions of justice for the jihadi movement with restraint, making sure not to celebrate excessively the result of an operation by the United States.The tactful enthusiasm is calculated. Many ISIS fighters, much of its military infrastructure, many media officials, and supporters were pulled from al-Qaeda. Now, with ISIS’ “Caliph” dead and that Caliphate itself destroyed, al-Qaeda has been given its biggest opportunity yet to bring many of them back under its tent. SITE Intelligence GroupPerhaps the most profound instance of this outreach was a lengthy essay by “Adel Amin,” the pen name of a prominent ideologue linked to the Shabaab al-Mujahideen Movement, al-Qaeda’s branch in Somalia and most powerful affiliate. The message, disseminated widely across al-Qaeda-supporting channels and chat groups (many of which are also frequented by pro-ISIS users), demanded that ISIS supporters “return to the road of righteousness” after the Islamic State, in all of its excessive aggression and delusions of destiny, has proven itself a failure. Amin wrote:The situation here is not one in which to gloat. It is a situation for reminding and calling on those who remained in the ranks of al-Baghdadi, to reconsider… Indeed, we witnessed its back being broken, its leaders getting killed, and its banner falling, and we hope that we can witness whoever remains from its soldiers returning to righteousness.Statements by other ideologues and supporters voiced the same points. A statement by Sirajuddin Zurayqat, a former religious official in the now-defunct al-Qaeda-linked Brigades of Abdullah Azzam in Lebanon, urged: “Now [Baghdadi] is dead and there is not one from the Ummah grieving over him or giving condolences... Therefore, those who were deceived by him should reconsider before it is too late!”These messages echo the same calls heard from Zawahiri and al-Qaeda affiliates over the years calling on ISIS fighters to “repent” and leave the group. Yet despite these new circumstances, ISIS supporters will not easily be moved. Since the summer of 2016, the group’s followers have seen the loss of the major cities Mosul in Iraq and Raqqah in Syria as well as the death of revered ISIS figures like Omar Shishani, Abu Muhammad al-‘Adnani, and others. With the latest setbacks to its leadership, ISIS-linked accounts online already have poured out calls to stay steadfast and have even used Baghdadi’s death as a rallying point to carry out new attacks. Reinforcing this undeterred support is an ISIS military and media machine that has shown no sign of stopping in the last two days. While ISIS has not yet officially acknowledged the death of Baghdadi, it has continued reporting on day-to-day military activity across Iraq, Syria, and the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.ISIS' Yemen Province - AQAP Prisoners as Featured in the video “He Who Starts is More Unjust”SITE Intelligence GroupFurthermore, while al-Qaeda affiliates like the Shabaab serve as powerful representatives of the organization, al-Qaeda Central is weaker than it has ever been. These days, al-Qaeda Central’s role is largely symbolic, limited to leadership messages and other content while steering the big-picture ethos of the organization. Its attempts to bolster its image, already heavily weighed down by a less-than-charismatic leader in Zawahiri, were upended upon the death of Hamza bin Laden, the son of Osama, whom al-Qaeda likely was grooming for an eventual leadership position. These variables considered, al-Qaeda may not be the appealing alternative for jihadists that its supporters want it to seem. So, while some fighters might very well join the ranks of al-Qaeda affiliates in their region, we shouldn't expect to see any drastic migration from ISIS’ ranks into its rival’s.Despite any notions of good-riddance that al-Qaeda and its supporters attach to Baghdadi’s death, and for whatever number of defectors it may win over as a result of Baghdadi’s demise, ISIS is not going anywhere. The barriers between these terrorist organizations have only hardened over the years, fueling deadly clashes and jihadi PR wars. Baghdadi was not the sole barrier keeping ISIS members from joining al-Qaeda, and his death is unlikely to diminish existing disputes.How U.S. Commandos IDed a ‘Mutilated’ Baghdadi So QuicklyRead more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

But even his claim now, that Republicans can ask questions, has been undermined, because now he’s directing witnesses not to answer questions that he doesn’t want the witness to answer, if they’re asked by Republicans.“He’s not cut off one Democrat, he’s not interrupted one Democrat and told a witness not to answer Democrat members’ questions, but today he started telling the witness not to answer questions by certain Republicans. That reeks.”House Republicans have been hostile to Schiff’s handling of the impeachment probe, and last week attempted to pass a resolution to censure the California Democrat and demanded his resignation.

He was undocumented.

Photograph: Erik Jepsen/UC San Diego PublicationsTom K Wong’s world shattered at age 16 in 1998 when his parents told him he was undocumented. The Riverside, California, teenager thought his life was over.Now 37, Wong is one of the prominent scholars in the US on immigration, most recently uncovering abuses inside detention centers in his latest University of California, San Diego research. The political science professor, whose family migrated from Hong Kong when he was two and overstayed their visas, released groundbreaking research on Tuesday on asylum seekers, exposing violence and suffering at the border as the Trump administration is escalating its crackdown on migrants.Wong surveyed more than 600 asylum seekers affected by Donald Trump’s controversial “remain in Mexico” policy, which has forced tens of thousands to return to Mexico while their cases advance. Roughly, 85% reported that immigration detention facilities failed to provide adequate food and water and that they were unable to sleep due to overcrowding, cold temperatures and other conditions. Only 20% reported being able to take care of basic hygiene, such as showering and brushing their teeth.More than half said they faced verbal abuse inside detention, with some saying they also suffered physical abuse. Roughly 25% also had their property seized when taken into detention, including important documents and cash that was not returned to them, he said.A majority said they were forced to return to Mexico without any further investigation of the violence they might face there, which Wong said was a direct violation of the policy.While waiting in Mexico, one out of four said they were threatened with physical violence, and more said they ended up homeless.Asked about Wong’s research, a spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) said the agency “provides safe, humane, clean, professionally run and appropriate conditions of confinement” and access to legal and translation services. A spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection, which also detains migrants, said it “takes allegations of mistreatment of individuals in our facilities seriously” and that employees found to violate standards “will be held accountable”.Wong talked with the Guardian about his non-traditional academic career, the crisis at the border, and how he uses his PhD to fight back. The conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.Can you tell me what it was like to discover you were undocumented?My parents told me I couldn’t go with my high school basketball team to Canada. Then they told me I couldn’t get a driver’s license. I couldn’t get a job. And there was just a cascade of no, no, no. And finally my parents said it’s not because we don’t want you to do these things, it’s because you can’t. All my hopes and dreams about growing up were literally shattered in a single moment. And it was during a time when there wasn’t the undocumented youth movement, so I wasn’t able to find other students.I grew up in a predominantly Latino neighborhood, and before I found out I was undocumented, California was becoming a ground zero for this emerging anti-immigrant movement. I remember there were policy debates with the white kids on one side, the brown kids on the other, and me feeling like I had little understanding. But everything that was being said negatively toward my Latino classmates actually applied more directly to me.How did you overcome this and become an academic?I barely graduated high school after learning I was undocumented, because at the time I thought, what’s the point? But I got married when I was 19 and I was able to adjust my immigration status. I paid for a summer politics class, and I thought if this professor can make a living teaching, maybe I can do the same.It took me years to realize I bring a different perspective to the study of immigration, politics and policy, that my history is my comparative advantage. It’s a perspective that helps me ask questions that others don’t. It took me a while to talk about my experience of being undocumented, because my parents’ immigration status was still tenuous. But they’re fine now, and I’m able to speak out.What has been most shocking to you about your findings on what happens to asylum seekers?Some findings were simultaneously shocking, but also very expected since we’ve heard anecdotal reports. There were over 200 incidents of verbal abuse, dozens of instances of physical abuse and even property being taken away. I heard of someone losing their life savings.The findings about language access also really stuck out. Individuals are getting instructions about critically important steps in languages that they don’t speak: often Central American asylum speakers who speak an indigenous language by default are given instructions in Spanish. In San Diego, there are a lot of different languages – Asian Indians seeking asylum who speak Hindi were given instructions in English or Spanish. I find it hard to believe that we as a country can’t find a Hindi speaker. This is a basic due process tenet.What do we now know about the conditions people face when they are forced to return to Mexico?So many have experienced or been threatened with physical violence while waiting. Despite the handshake agreement between the United States and Mexico that Mexico is responsible for the humanitarian needs of these asylum seekers being returned, we are putting people in harm’s way by returning them to Mexico.What do you think is most important for the public to understand about the impact of Trump’s policies on asylum seekers right now?This administration wants to see net zero refugee admissions, which we are getting close to. This is a core part of the agenda. It’s not just in disregard of international and domestic law, but it’s in disregard of the fact that so many of the asylum seekers who are being turned away are seeking protection from persecution. It’s an agenda that is blind to the experiences of these families. The inevitable result is that people will be sent to circumstances where they will likely die.What do you hope is the impact of your work and your findings?I used to believe in facts swaying public opinion. But I fear we are in a political moment where the ability to select which facts to consider true is making the work we do less important. Now it may be very difficult to move public opinion when opinions are formed on such a visceral level.But facts still matter. The truth still matters, because what is happening now is the administration is often acting first, and then the courts are litigating later. So even if the public is less and less swayed by the facts on the ground, judges still are.Were there moments in your career where you found academia unwelcoming?It can be strange having lived through something and then hearing about that subject through the perspective of somebody who studies the topic, but doesn’t have that personal connection. But I do quantitative work, and at the end of the day, the data speak much louder than my own personal background.What’s the hardest part of doing academic work that is relevant to urgent policy matters?A lot of academics are just scared about being wrong and being publicly wrong. But I believe in the importance of the work, and that means I need to be confident that I can stand by it. A few years ago I thought my bar was peer review in an academic journal. Now I understand my bar to be that as well as, “Can this pass muster with a federal judge or can this withstand a deposition from attorneys for the Department of Justice?”What effect does the work have on you personally?It’s often miserable. It’s difficult to hear. It’s difficult to interact with people, to see women and little kids who are the ages of my own children in shelters in Mexico, not knowing what’s going on. It is difficult to not internalize it. But I believe in the work. If it’s not me, I’m afraid there won’t be others who step up. Because it’ll be too easy for those others who want to step up to then step out after really understanding how difficult it is to have these conversations.How do you think we can get out of this crisis moment?We have to know our immigration policy past. Every generation gets to decide for itself, whether it embraces diversity through our immigration system or pushes it away by closing our golden door. We are defining for this generation how we are answering the question of what it means to be a nation of immigrants. And we have done that historically.

To this day, al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri’s speeches rarely come without some critique of the “epidemic” put forth by ISIS.Trump Officials Had No Clue Where He Got ‘Whimpering’ Detail in His Baghdadi Raid AccountOddly, Baghdadi was killed in Idlib, a haven of al-Qaeda-linked fighters and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a Syrian Islamist faction led by Abu Muhammad al-Julani, a former al-Qaeda comrade who had become one of Baghdadi's most bitter foes. There has been some speculation Baghdadi was not just hiding out but trying to recruit from the ranks of his enemies.Neither al-Qaeda Central nor its affiliates have commented on Baghdadi’s death as yet, but within hours after the news broke, al-Qaeda ideologues and supporters already were celebrating the event and discussing what it will mean for the future of jihad. In chat groups online, al-Qaeda supporters voiced resentment after years of bitter strife with the group, and the scale of these responses illustrates just how much of a big deal and opportunity they see with Baghdadi’s death.“Based on his orders, thousands of the mujahideen were killed,” one post read.“How thrilled were they every time leaders from al-Qaeda were martyred?” read another.Some wished Baghdadi the ultimate condemnation:  “May Allah send him to Hell.”Messages by others, however, particularly al-Qaeda-linked ideologues, balanced expressions of justice for the jihadi movement with restraint, making sure not to celebrate excessively the result of an operation by the United States.The tactful enthusiasm is calculated. Many ISIS fighters, much of its military infrastructure, many media officials, and supporters were pulled from al-Qaeda. Now, with ISIS’ “Caliph” dead and that Caliphate itself destroyed, al-Qaeda has been given its biggest opportunity yet to bring many of them back under its tent. SITE Intelligence GroupPerhaps the most profound instance of this outreach was a lengthy essay by “Adel Amin,” the pen name of a prominent ideologue linked to the Shabaab al-Mujahideen Movement, al-Qaeda’s branch in Somalia and most powerful affiliate. The message, disseminated widely across al-Qaeda-supporting channels and chat groups (many of which are also frequented by pro-ISIS users), demanded that ISIS supporters “return to the road of righteousness” after the Islamic State, in all of its excessive aggression and delusions of destiny, has proven itself a failure. Amin wrote:The situation here is not one in which to gloat. It is a situation for reminding and calling on those who remained in the ranks of al-Baghdadi, to reconsider… Indeed, we witnessed its back being broken, its leaders getting killed, and its banner falling, and we hope that we can witness whoever remains from its soldiers returning to righteousness.Statements by other ideologues and supporters voiced the same points. A statement by Sirajuddin Zurayqat, a former religious official in the now-defunct al-Qaeda-linked Brigades of Abdullah Azzam in Lebanon, urged: “Now [Baghdadi] is dead and there is not one from the Ummah grieving over him or giving condolences... Therefore, those who were deceived by him should reconsider before it is too late!”These messages echo the same calls heard from Zawahiri and al-Qaeda affiliates over the years calling on ISIS fighters to “repent” and leave the group. Yet despite these new circumstances, ISIS supporters will not easily be moved. Since the summer of 2016, the group’s followers have seen the loss of the major cities Mosul in Iraq and Raqqah in Syria as well as the death of revered ISIS figures like Omar Shishani, Abu Muhammad al-‘Adnani, and others. With the latest setbacks to its leadership, ISIS-linked accounts online already have poured out calls to stay steadfast and have even used Baghdadi’s death as a rallying point to carry out new attacks. Reinforcing this undeterred support is an ISIS military and media machine that has shown no sign of stopping in the last two days. While ISIS has not yet officially acknowledged the death of Baghdadi, it has continued reporting on day-to-day military activity across Iraq, Syria, and the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.ISIS' Yemen Province - AQAP Prisoners as Featured in the video “He Who Starts is More Unjust”SITE Intelligence GroupFurthermore, while al-Qaeda affiliates like the Shabaab serve as powerful representatives of the organization, al-Qaeda Central is weaker than it has ever been. These days, al-Qaeda Central’s role is largely symbolic, limited to leadership messages and other content while steering the big-picture ethos of the organization. Its attempts to bolster its image, already heavily weighed down by a less-than-charismatic leader in Zawahiri, were upended upon the death of Hamza bin Laden, the son of Osama, whom al-Qaeda likely was grooming for an eventual leadership position. These variables considered, al-Qaeda may not be the appealing alternative for jihadists that its supporters want it to seem. So, while some fighters might very well join the ranks of al-Qaeda affiliates in their region, we shouldn't expect to see any drastic migration from ISIS’ ranks into its rival’s.Despite any notions of good-riddance that al-Qaeda and its supporters attach to Baghdadi’s death, and for whatever number of defectors it may win over as a result of Baghdadi’s demise, ISIS is not going anywhere. The barriers between these terrorist organizations have only hardened over the years, fueling deadly clashes and jihadi PR wars. Baghdadi was not the sole barrier keeping ISIS members from joining al-Qaeda, and his death is unlikely to diminish existing disputes.How U.S. Commandos IDed a ‘Mutilated’ Baghdadi So QuicklyRead more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

But even his claim now, that Republicans can ask questions, has been undermined, because now he’s directing witnesses not to answer questions that he doesn’t want the witness to answer, if they’re asked by Republicans.“He’s not cut off one Democrat, he’s not interrupted one Democrat and told a witness not to answer Democrat members’ questions, but today he started telling the witness not to answer questions by certain Republicans. That reeks.”House Republicans have been hostile to Schiff’s handling of the impeachment probe, and last week attempted to pass a resolution to censure the California Democrat and demanded his resignation.

He was undocumented. Now he&#39;s exposing detention center abuse,"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 17:49:46 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/undocumented-now-hes-exposing-detention-100018960.html,"Tom Wong, a UC San Diego professor, has surveyed 600 asylum seekers and says the president’s policy is ‘sending people to die’Tom Wong, a UC San Diego professor, is uncovering the abuse immigrants face in overcrowded detention facilities. Photograph: Erik Jepsen/UC San Diego PublicationsTom K Wong’s world shattered at age 16 in 1998 when his parents told him he was undocumented. The Riverside, California, teenager thought his life was over.Now 37, Wong is one of the prominent scholars in the US on immigration, most recently uncovering abuses inside detention centers in his latest University of California, San Diego research. The political science professor, whose family migrated from Hong Kong when he was two and overstayed their visas, released groundbreaking research on Tuesday on asylum seekers, exposing violence and suffering at the border as the Trump administration is escalating its crackdown on migrants.Wong surveyed more than 600 asylum seekers affected by Donald Trump’s controversial “remain in Mexico” policy, which has forced tens of thousands to return to Mexico while their cases advance. Roughly, 85% reported that immigration detention facilities failed to provide adequate food and water and that they were unable to sleep due to overcrowding, cold temperatures and other conditions. Only 20% reported being able to take care of basic hygiene, such as showering and brushing their teeth.More than half said they faced verbal abuse inside detention, with some saying they also suffered physical abuse. Roughly 25% also had their property seized when taken into detention, including important documents and cash that was not returned to them, he said.A majority said they were forced to return to Mexico without any further investigation of the violence they might face there, which Wong said was a direct violation of the policy.While waiting in Mexico, one out of four said they were threatened with physical violence, and more said they ended up homeless.Asked about Wong’s research, a spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) said the agency “provides safe, humane, clean, professionally run and appropriate conditions of confinement” and access to legal and translation services. A spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection, which also detains migrants, said it “takes allegations of mistreatment of individuals in our facilities seriously” and that employees found to violate standards “will be held accountable”.Wong talked with the Guardian about his non-traditional academic career, the crisis at the border, and how he uses his PhD to fight back. The conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.Can you tell me what it was like to discover you were undocumented?My parents told me I couldn’t go with my high school basketball team to Canada. Then they told me I couldn’t get a driver’s license. I couldn’t get a job. And there was just a cascade of no, no, no. And finally my parents said it’s not because we don’t want you to do these things, it’s because you can’t. All my hopes and dreams about growing up were literally shattered in a single moment. And it was during a time when there wasn’t the undocumented youth movement, so I wasn’t able to find other students.I grew up in a predominantly Latino neighborhood, and before I found out I was undocumented, California was becoming a ground zero for this emerging anti-immigrant movement. I remember there were policy debates with the white kids on one side, the brown kids on the other, and me feeling like I had little understanding. But everything that was being said negatively toward my Latino classmates actually applied more directly to me.How did you overcome this and become an academic?I barely graduated high school after learning I was undocumented, because at the time I thought, what’s the point? But I got married when I was 19 and I was able to adjust my immigration status. I paid for a summer politics class, and I thought if this professor can make a living teaching, maybe I can do the same.It took me years to realize I bring a different perspective to the study of immigration, politics and policy, that my history is my comparative advantage. It’s a perspective that helps me ask questions that others don’t. It took me a while to talk about my experience of being undocumented, because my parents’ immigration status was still tenuous. But they’re fine now, and I’m able to speak out.What has been most shocking to you about your findings on what happens to asylum seekers?Some findings were simultaneously shocking, but also very expected since we’ve heard anecdotal reports. There were over 200 incidents of verbal abuse, dozens of instances of physical abuse and even property being taken away. I heard of someone losing their life savings.The findings about language access also really stuck out. Individuals are getting instructions about critically important steps in languages that they don’t speak: often Central American asylum speakers who speak an indigenous language by default are given instructions in Spanish. In San Diego, there are a lot of different languages – Asian Indians seeking asylum who speak Hindi were given instructions in English or Spanish. I find it hard to believe that we as a country can’t find a Hindi speaker. This is a basic due process tenet.What do we now know about the conditions people face when they are forced to return to Mexico?So many have experienced or been threatened with physical violence while waiting. Despite the handshake agreement between the United States and Mexico that Mexico is responsible for the humanitarian needs of these asylum seekers being returned, we are putting people in harm’s way by returning them to Mexico.What do you think is most important for the public to understand about the impact of Trump’s policies on asylum seekers right now?This administration wants to see net zero refugee admissions, which we are getting close to. This is a core part of the agenda. It’s not just in disregard of international and domestic law, but it’s in disregard of the fact that so many of the asylum seekers who are being turned away are seeking protection from persecution. It’s an agenda that is blind to the experiences of these families. The inevitable result is that people will be sent to circumstances where they will likely die.What do you hope is the impact of your work and your findings?I used to believe in facts swaying public opinion. But I fear we are in a political moment where the ability to select which facts to consider true is making the work we do less important. Now it may be very difficult to move public opinion when opinions are formed on such a visceral level.But facts still matter. The truth still matters, because what is happening now is the administration is often acting first, and then the courts are litigating later. So even if the public is less and less swayed by the facts on the ground, judges still are.Were there moments in your career where you found academia unwelcoming?It can be strange having lived through something and then hearing about that subject through the perspective of somebody who studies the topic, but doesn’t have that personal connection. But I do quantitative work, and at the end of the day, the data speak much louder than my own personal background.What’s the hardest part of doing academic work that is relevant to urgent policy matters?A lot of academics are just scared about being wrong and being publicly wrong. But I believe in the importance of the work, and that means I need to be confident that I can stand by it. A few years ago I thought my bar was peer review in an academic journal. Now I understand my bar to be that as well as, “Can this pass muster with a federal judge or can this withstand a deposition from attorneys for the Department of Justice?”What effect does the work have on you personally?It’s often miserable. It’s difficult to hear. It’s difficult to interact with people, to see women and little kids who are the ages of my own children in shelters in Mexico, not knowing what’s going on. It is difficult to not internalize it. But I believe in the work. If it’s not me, I’m afraid there won’t be others who step up. Because it’ll be too easy for those others who want to step up to then step out after really understanding how difficult it is to have these conversations.How do you think we can get out of this crisis moment?We have to know our immigration policy past. Every generation gets to decide for itself, whether it embraces diversity through our immigration system or pushes it away by closing our golden door. We are defining for this generation how we are answering the question of what it means to be a nation of immigrants. And we have done that historically. And in some periods in our history, we have closed our doors to immigrants, and in other periods we have opened them again. This is cyclical. It is difficult to live through, but this has been a cyclical part of our immigration policy past.Every four years we as a country get to collectively answer whether or not we still believe in this idea that we are a nation of immigrants. In 2020, we will get to vote.",http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5mTp_BGJvUvwmexmBzFrEg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/9a0dd9c25d5ea0ca1353ff565b5c5106,He was undocumented.

Roughly 25% also had their property seized when taken into detention, including important documents and cash that was not returned to them, he said.A majority said they were forced to return to Mexico without any further investigation of the violence they might face there, which Wong said was a direct violation of the policy.While waiting in Mexico, one out of four said they were threatened with physical violence, and more said they ended up homeless.Asked about Wong’s research, a spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) said the agency “provides safe, humane, clean, professionally run and appropriate conditions of confinement” and access to legal and translation services. A spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection, which also detains migrants, said it “takes allegations of mistreatment of individuals in our facilities seriously” and that employees found to violate standards “will be held accountable”.Wong talked with the Guardian about his non-traditional academic career, the crisis at the border, and how he uses his PhD to fight back. The conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.Can you tell me what it was like to discover you were undocumented?My parents told me I couldn’t go with my high school basketball team to Canada. Then they told me I couldn’t get a driver’s license. I couldn’t get a job. And there was just a cascade of no, no, no. And finally my parents said it’s not because we don’t want you to do these things, it’s because you can’t. All my hopes and dreams about growing up were literally shattered in a single moment. And it was during a time when there wasn’t the undocumented youth movement, so I wasn’t able to find other students.I grew up in a predominantly Latino neighborhood, and before I found out I was undocumented, California was becoming a ground zero for this emerging anti-immigrant movement. I remember there were policy debates with the white kids on one side, the brown kids on the other, and me feeling like I had little understanding. But everything that was being said negatively toward my Latino classmates actually applied more directly to me.How did you overcome this and become an academic?I barely graduated high school after learning I was undocumented, because at the time I thought, what’s the point? But I got married when I was 19 and I was able to adjust my immigration status. I paid for a summer politics class, and I thought if this professor can make a living teaching, maybe I can do the same.It took me years to realize I bring a different perspective to the study of immigration, politics and policy, that my history is my comparative advantage. It’s a perspective that helps me ask questions that others don’t. It took me a while to talk about my experience of being undocumented, because my parents’ immigration status was still tenuous. But they’re fine now, and I’m able to speak out.What has been most shocking to you about your findings on what happens to asylum seekers?Some findings were simultaneously shocking, but also very expected since we’ve heard anecdotal reports. There were over 200 incidents of verbal abuse, dozens of instances of physical abuse and even property being taken away. I heard of someone losing their life savings.The findings about language access also really stuck out. Individuals are getting instructions about critically important steps in languages that they don’t speak: often Central American asylum speakers who speak an indigenous language by default are given instructions in Spanish. In San Diego, there are a lot of different languages – Asian Indians seeking asylum who speak Hindi were given instructions in English or Spanish. I find it hard to believe that we as a country can’t find a Hindi speaker. This is a basic due process tenet.What do we now know about the conditions people face when they are forced to return to Mexico?So many have experienced or been threatened with physical violence while waiting. Despite the handshake agreement between the United States and Mexico that Mexico is responsible for the humanitarian needs of these asylum seekers being returned, we are putting people in harm’s way by returning them to Mexico.What do you think is most important for the public to understand about the impact of Trump’s policies on asylum seekers right now?This administration wants to see net zero refugee admissions, which we are getting close to. This is a core part of the agenda. It’s not just in disregard of international and domestic law, but it’s in disregard of the fact that so many of the asylum seekers who are being turned away are seeking protection from persecution. It’s an agenda that is blind to the experiences of these families. The inevitable result is that people will be sent to circumstances where they will likely die.What do you hope is the impact of your work and your findings?I used to believe in facts swaying public opinion. But I fear we are in a political moment where the ability to select which facts to consider true is making the work we do less important. Now it may be very difficult to move public opinion when opinions are formed on such a visceral level.But facts still matter. The truth still matters, because what is happening now is the administration is often acting first, and then the courts are litigating later. So even if the public is less and less swayed by the facts on the ground, judges still are.Were there moments in your career where you found academia unwelcoming?It can be strange having lived through something and then hearing about that subject through the perspective of somebody who studies the topic, but doesn’t have that personal connection. But I do quantitative work, and at the end of the day, the data speak much louder than my own personal background.What’s the hardest part of doing academic work that is relevant to urgent policy matters?A lot of academics are just scared about being wrong and being publicly wrong. But I believe in the importance of the work, and that means I need to be confident that I can stand by it. A few years ago I thought my bar was peer review in an academic journal. Now I understand my bar to be that as well as, “Can this pass muster with a federal judge or can this withstand a deposition from attorneys for the Department of Justice?”What effect does the work have on you personally?It’s often miserable. It’s difficult to hear. It’s difficult to interact with people, to see women and little kids who are the ages of my own children in shelters in Mexico, not knowing what’s going on. It is difficult to not internalize it. But I believe in the work. If it’s not me, I’m afraid there won’t be others who step up. Because it’ll be too easy for those others who want to step up to then step out after really understanding how difficult it is to have these conversations.How do you think we can get out of this crisis moment?We have to know our immigration policy past. Every generation gets to decide for itself, whether it embraces diversity through our immigration system or pushes it away by closing our golden door. We are defining for this generation how we are answering the question of what it means to be a nation of immigrants. And we have done that historically. And in some periods in our history, we have closed our doors to immigrants, and in other periods we have opened them again. This is cyclical.

What Baghdadi’s Death Means for al Qaeda—and Why It Matters,"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 13:14:08 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/baghdadi-death-means-al-qaeda-171408420.html,"SITE Intelligence GroupWith ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi killed one day and the group’s official spokesman Abu Hassan al-Muhajir the next, there’s a giant hole in the pseudo-Caliphate structure of the so-called Islamic State. The group must now, by its strict religious tenets, find a new (supposed) descendant of the Prophet Muhammed to fill the role of Caliph. But the deaths of those two are equally consequential for al-Qaeda, the bitter rival of ISIS for leadership of global jihad. Al-Qaeda has spent the last six years branding the Caliphate as illegitimate, too extreme, and ultimately harmful. When ISIS declared the establishment of its so-called Caliphate spanning territory in Syria and Iraq in 2014, al-Qaeda and its affiliates unanimously rejected it. To this day, al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri’s speeches rarely come without some critique of the “epidemic” put forth by ISIS.Trump Officials Had No Clue Where He Got ‘Whimpering’ Detail in His Baghdadi Raid AccountOddly, Baghdadi was killed in Idlib, a haven of al-Qaeda-linked fighters and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a Syrian Islamist faction led by Abu Muhammad al-Julani, a former al-Qaeda comrade who had become one of Baghdadi's most bitter foes. There has been some speculation Baghdadi was not just hiding out but trying to recruit from the ranks of his enemies.Neither al-Qaeda Central nor its affiliates have commented on Baghdadi’s death as yet, but within hours after the news broke, al-Qaeda ideologues and supporters already were celebrating the event and discussing what it will mean for the future of jihad. In chat groups online, al-Qaeda supporters voiced resentment after years of bitter strife with the group, and the scale of these responses illustrates just how much of a big deal and opportunity they see with Baghdadi’s death.“Based on his orders, thousands of the mujahideen were killed,” one post read.“How thrilled were they every time leaders from al-Qaeda were martyred?” read another.Some wished Baghdadi the ultimate condemnation:  “May Allah send him to Hell.”Messages by others, however, particularly al-Qaeda-linked ideologues, balanced expressions of justice for the jihadi movement with restraint, making sure not to celebrate excessively the result of an operation by the United States.The tactful enthusiasm is calculated. Many ISIS fighters, much of its military infrastructure, many media officials, and supporters were pulled from al-Qaeda. Now, with ISIS’ “Caliph” dead and that Caliphate itself destroyed, al-Qaeda has been given its biggest opportunity yet to bring many of them back under its tent. SITE Intelligence GroupPerhaps the most profound instance of this outreach was a lengthy essay by “Adel Amin,” the pen name of a prominent ideologue linked to the Shabaab al-Mujahideen Movement, al-Qaeda’s branch in Somalia and most powerful affiliate. The message, disseminated widely across al-Qaeda-supporting channels and chat groups (many of which are also frequented by pro-ISIS users), demanded that ISIS supporters “return to the road of righteousness” after the Islamic State, in all of its excessive aggression and delusions of destiny, has proven itself a failure. Amin wrote:The situation here is not one in which to gloat. It is a situation for reminding and calling on those who remained in the ranks of al-Baghdadi, to reconsider… Indeed, we witnessed its back being broken, its leaders getting killed, and its banner falling, and we hope that we can witness whoever remains from its soldiers returning to righteousness.Statements by other ideologues and supporters voiced the same points. A statement by Sirajuddin Zurayqat, a former religious official in the now-defunct al-Qaeda-linked Brigades of Abdullah Azzam in Lebanon, urged: “Now [Baghdadi] is dead and there is not one from the Ummah grieving over him or giving condolences... Therefore, those who were deceived by him should reconsider before it is too late!”These messages echo the same calls heard from Zawahiri and al-Qaeda affiliates over the years calling on ISIS fighters to “repent” and leave the group. Yet despite these new circumstances, ISIS supporters will not easily be moved. Since the summer of 2016, the group’s followers have seen the loss of the major cities Mosul in Iraq and Raqqah in Syria as well as the death of revered ISIS figures like Omar Shishani, Abu Muhammad al-‘Adnani, and others. With the latest setbacks to its leadership, ISIS-linked accounts online already have poured out calls to stay steadfast and have even used Baghdadi’s death as a rallying point to carry out new attacks. Reinforcing this undeterred support is an ISIS military and media machine that has shown no sign of stopping in the last two days. While ISIS has not yet officially acknowledged the death of Baghdadi, it has continued reporting on day-to-day military activity across Iraq, Syria, and the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.ISIS' Yemen Province - AQAP Prisoners as Featured in the video “He Who Starts is More Unjust”SITE Intelligence GroupFurthermore, while al-Qaeda affiliates like the Shabaab serve as powerful representatives of the organization, al-Qaeda Central is weaker than it has ever been. These days, al-Qaeda Central’s role is largely symbolic, limited to leadership messages and other content while steering the big-picture ethos of the organization. Its attempts to bolster its image, already heavily weighed down by a less-than-charismatic leader in Zawahiri, were upended upon the death of Hamza bin Laden, the son of Osama, whom al-Qaeda likely was grooming for an eventual leadership position. These variables considered, al-Qaeda may not be the appealing alternative for jihadists that its supporters want it to seem. So, while some fighters might very well join the ranks of al-Qaeda affiliates in their region, we shouldn't expect to see any drastic migration from ISIS’ ranks into its rival’s.Despite any notions of good-riddance that al-Qaeda and its supporters attach to Baghdadi’s death, and for whatever number of defectors it may win over as a result of Baghdadi’s demise, ISIS is not going anywhere. The barriers between these terrorist organizations have only hardened over the years, fueling deadly clashes and jihadi PR wars. Baghdadi was not the sole barrier keeping ISIS members from joining al-Qaeda, and his death is unlikely to diminish existing disputes.How U.S. Commandos IDed a ‘Mutilated’ Baghdadi So QuicklyRead more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

But even his claim now, that Republicans can ask questions, has been undermined, because now he’s directing witnesses not to answer questions that he doesn’t want the witness to answer, if they’re asked by Republicans.“He’s not cut off one Democrat, he’s not interrupted one Democrat and told a witness not to answer Democrat members’ questions, but today he started telling the witness not to answer questions by certain Republicans. That reeks.”House Republicans have been hostile to Schiff’s handling of the impeachment probe, and last week attempted to pass a resolution to censure the California Democrat and demanded his resignation.

The Riverside, California, teenager thought his life was over.Now 37, Wong is one of the prominent scholars in the US on immigration, most recently uncovering abuses inside detention centers in his latest University of California, San Diego research. The political science professor, whose family migrated from Hong Kong when he was two and overstayed their visas, released groundbreaking research on Tuesday on asylum seekers, exposing violence and suffering at the border as the Trump administration is escalating its crackdown on migrants.Wong surveyed more than 600 asylum seekers affected by Donald Trump’s controversial “remain in Mexico” policy, which has forced tens of thousands to return to Mexico while their cases advance. Roughly, 85% reported that immigration detention facilities failed to provide adequate food and water and that they were unable to sleep due to overcrowding, cold temperatures and other conditions. Only 20% reported being able to take care of basic hygiene, such as showering and brushing their teeth.More than half said they faced verbal abuse inside detention, with some saying they also suffered physical abuse.

He was undocumented.

Photograph: Erik Jepsen/UC San Diego PublicationsTom K Wong’s world shattered at age 16 in 1998 when his parents told him he was undocumented. The Riverside, California, teenager thought his life was over.Now 37, Wong is one of the prominent scholars in the US on immigration, most recently uncovering abuses inside detention centers in his latest University of California, San Diego research. The political science professor, whose family migrated from Hong Kong when he was two and overstayed their visas, released groundbreaking research on Tuesday on asylum seekers, exposing violence and suffering at the border as the Trump administration is escalating its crackdown on migrants.Wong surveyed more than 600 asylum seekers affected by Donald Trump’s controversial “remain in Mexico” policy, which has forced tens of thousands to return to Mexico while their cases advance. Roughly, 85% reported that immigration detention facilities failed to provide adequate food and water and that they were unable to sleep due to overcrowding, cold temperatures and other conditions. Only 20% reported being able to take care of basic hygiene, such as showering and brushing their teeth.More than half said they faced verbal abuse inside detention, with some saying they also suffered physical abuse. Roughly 25% also had their property seized when taken into detention, including important documents and cash that was not returned to them, he said.A majority said they were forced to return to Mexico without any further investigation of the violence they might face there, which Wong said was a direct violation of the policy.While waiting in Mexico, one out of four said they were threatened with physical violence, and more said they ended up homeless.Asked about Wong’s research, a spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) said the agency “provides safe, humane, clean, professionally run and appropriate conditions of confinement” and access to legal and translation services. A spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection, which also detains migrants, said it “takes allegations of mistreatment of individuals in our facilities seriously” and that employees found to violate standards “will be held accountable”.Wong talked with the Guardian about his non-traditional academic career, the crisis at the border, and how he uses his PhD to fight back. The conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.Can you tell me what it was like to discover you were undocumented?My parents told me I couldn’t go with my high school basketball team to Canada. Then they told me I couldn’t get a driver’s license. I couldn’t get a job. And there was just a cascade of no, no, no. And finally my parents said it’s not because we don’t want you to do these things, it’s because you can’t. All my hopes and dreams about growing up were literally shattered in a single moment. And it was during a time when there wasn’t the undocumented youth movement, so I wasn’t able to find other students.I grew up in a predominantly Latino neighborhood, and before I found out I was undocumented, California was becoming a ground zero for this emerging anti-immigrant movement. I remember there were policy debates with the white kids on one side, the brown kids on the other, and me feeling like I had little understanding. But everything that was being said negatively toward my Latino classmates actually applied more directly to me.How did you overcome this and become an academic?I barely graduated high school after learning I was undocumented, because at the time I thought, what’s the point? But I got married when I was 19 and I was able to adjust my immigration status. I paid for a summer politics class, and I thought if this professor can make a living teaching, maybe I can do the same.It took me years to realize I bring a different perspective to the study of immigration, politics and policy, that my history is my comparative advantage. It’s a perspective that helps me ask questions that others don’t. It took me a while to talk about my experience of being undocumented, because my parents’ immigration status was still tenuous. But they’re fine now, and I’m able to speak out.What has been most shocking to you about your findings on what happens to asylum seekers?Some findings were simultaneously shocking, but also very expected since we’ve heard anecdotal reports. There were over 200 incidents of verbal abuse, dozens of instances of physical abuse and even property being taken away. I heard of someone losing their life savings.The findings about language access also really stuck out. Individuals are getting instructions about critically important steps in languages that they don’t speak: often Central American asylum speakers who speak an indigenous language by default are given instructions in Spanish. In San Diego, there are a lot of different languages – Asian Indians seeking asylum who speak Hindi were given instructions in English or Spanish. I find it hard to believe that we as a country can’t find a Hindi speaker. This is a basic due process tenet.What do we now know about the conditions people face when they are forced to return to Mexico?So many have experienced or been threatened with physical violence while waiting. Despite the handshake agreement between the United States and Mexico that Mexico is responsible for the humanitarian needs of these asylum seekers being returned, we are putting people in harm’s way by returning them to Mexico.What do you think is most important for the public to understand about the impact of Trump’s policies on asylum seekers right now?This administration wants to see net zero refugee admissions, which we are getting close to. This is a core part of the agenda. It’s not just in disregard of international and domestic law, but it’s in disregard of the fact that so many of the asylum seekers who are being turned away are seeking protection from persecution. It’s an agenda that is blind to the experiences of these families. The inevitable result is that people will be sent to circumstances where they will likely die.What do you hope is the impact of your work and your findings?I used to believe in facts swaying public opinion. But I fear we are in a political moment where the ability to select which facts to consider true is making the work we do less important. Now it may be very difficult to move public opinion when opinions are formed on such a visceral level.But facts still matter. The truth still matters, because what is happening now is the administration is often acting first, and then the courts are litigating later. So even if the public is less and less swayed by the facts on the ground, judges still are.Were there moments in your career where you found academia unwelcoming?It can be strange having lived through something and then hearing about that subject through the perspective of somebody who studies the topic, but doesn’t have that personal connection. But I do quantitative work, and at the end of the day, the data speak much louder than my own personal background.What’s the hardest part of doing academic work that is relevant to urgent policy matters?A lot of academics are just scared about being wrong and being publicly wrong. But I believe in the importance of the work, and that means I need to be confident that I can stand by it. A few years ago I thought my bar was peer review in an academic journal. Now I understand my bar to be that as well as, “Can this pass muster with a federal judge or can this withstand a deposition from attorneys for the Department of Justice?”What effect does the work have on you personally?It’s often miserable. It’s difficult to hear. It’s difficult to interact with people, to see women and little kids who are the ages of my own children in shelters in Mexico, not knowing what’s going on. It is difficult to not internalize it. But I believe in the work. If it’s not me, I’m afraid there won’t be others who step up. Because it’ll be too easy for those others who want to step up to then step out after really understanding how difficult it is to have these conversations.How do you think we can get out of this crisis moment?We have to know our immigration policy past. Every generation gets to decide for itself, whether it embraces diversity through our immigration system or pushes it away by closing our golden door. We are defining for this generation how we are answering the question of what it means to be a nation of immigrants. And we have done that historically. And in some periods in our history, we have closed our doors to immigrants, and in other periods we have opened them again. This is cyclical. It is difficult to live through, but this has been a cyclical part of our immigration policy past.Every four years we as a country get to collectively answer whether or not we still believe in this idea that we are a nation of immigrants. In 2020, we will get to vote.",http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5mTp_BGJvUvwmexmBzFrEg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/9a0dd9c25d5ea0ca1353ff565b5c5106,He was undocumented.

So even if the public is less and less swayed by the facts on the ground, judges still are.Were there moments in your career where you found academia unwelcoming?It can be strange having lived through something and then hearing about that subject through the perspective of somebody who studies the topic, but doesn’t have that personal connection. But I do quantitative work, and at the end of the day, the data speak much louder than my own personal background.What’s the hardest part of doing academic work that is relevant to urgent policy matters?A lot of academics are just scared about being wrong and being publicly wrong. But I believe in the importance of the work, and that means I need to be confident that I can stand by it. A few years ago I thought my bar was peer review in an academic journal. Now I understand my bar to be that as well as, “Can this pass muster with a federal judge or can this withstand a deposition from attorneys for the Department of Justice?”What effect does the work have on you personally?It’s often miserable. It’s difficult to hear. It’s difficult to interact with people, to see women and little kids who are the ages of my own children in shelters in Mexico, not knowing what’s going on. It is difficult to not internalize it. But I believe in the work. If it’s not me, I’m afraid there won’t be others who step up. Because it’ll be too easy for those others who want to step up to then step out after really understanding how difficult it is to have these conversations.How do you think we can get out of this crisis moment?We have to know our immigration policy past. Every generation gets to decide for itself, whether it embraces diversity through our immigration system or pushes it away by closing our golden door. We are defining for this generation how we are answering the question of what it means to be a nation of immigrants. And we have done that historically. And in some periods in our history, we have closed our doors to immigrants, and in other periods we have opened them again. This is cyclical.

He was undocumented. Now he&#39;s exposing detention center abuse,"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 17:49:46 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/undocumented-now-hes-exposing-detention-100018960.html,"Tom Wong, a UC San Diego professor, has surveyed 600 asylum seekers and says the president’s policy is ‘sending people to die’Tom Wong, a UC San Diego professor, is uncovering the abuse immigrants face in overcrowded detention facilities. Photograph: Erik Jepsen/UC San Diego PublicationsTom K Wong’s world shattered at age 16 in 1998 when his parents told him he was undocumented. The Riverside, California, teenager thought his life was over.Now 37, Wong is one of the prominent scholars in the US on immigration, most recently uncovering abuses inside detention centers in his latest University of California, San Diego research. The political science professor, whose family migrated from Hong Kong when he was two and overstayed their visas, released groundbreaking research on Tuesday on asylum seekers, exposing violence and suffering at the border as the Trump administration is escalating its crackdown on migrants.Wong surveyed more than 600 asylum seekers affected by Donald Trump’s controversial “remain in Mexico” policy, which has forced tens of thousands to return to Mexico while their cases advance. Roughly, 85% reported that immigration detention facilities failed to provide adequate food and water and that they were unable to sleep due to overcrowding, cold temperatures and other conditions. Only 20% reported being able to take care of basic hygiene, such as showering and brushing their teeth.More than half said they faced verbal abuse inside detention, with some saying they also suffered physical abuse. Roughly 25% also had their property seized when taken into detention, including important documents and cash that was not returned to them, he said.A majority said they were forced to return to Mexico without any further investigation of the violence they might face there, which Wong said was a direct violation of the policy.While waiting in Mexico, one out of four said they were threatened with physical violence, and more said they ended up homeless.Asked about Wong’s research, a spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) said the agency “provides safe, humane, clean, professionally run and appropriate conditions of confinement” and access to legal and translation services. A spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection, which also detains migrants, said it “takes allegations of mistreatment of individuals in our facilities seriously” and that employees found to violate standards “will be held accountable”.Wong talked with the Guardian about his non-traditional academic career, the crisis at the border, and how he uses his PhD to fight back. The conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.Can you tell me what it was like to discover you were undocumented?My parents told me I couldn’t go with my high school basketball team to Canada. Then they told me I couldn’t get a driver’s license. I couldn’t get a job. And there was just a cascade of no, no, no. And finally my parents said it’s not because we don’t want you to do these things, it’s because you can’t. All my hopes and dreams about growing up were literally shattered in a single moment. And it was during a time when there wasn’t the undocumented youth movement, so I wasn’t able to find other students.I grew up in a predominantly Latino neighborhood, and before I found out I was undocumented, California was becoming a ground zero for this emerging anti-immigrant movement. I remember there were policy debates with the white kids on one side, the brown kids on the other, and me feeling like I had little understanding. But everything that was being said negatively toward my Latino classmates actually applied more directly to me.How did you overcome this and become an academic?I barely graduated high school after learning I was undocumented, because at the time I thought, what’s the point? But I got married when I was 19 and I was able to adjust my immigration status. I paid for a summer politics class, and I thought if this professor can make a living teaching, maybe I can do the same.It took me years to realize I bring a different perspective to the study of immigration, politics and policy, that my history is my comparative advantage. It’s a perspective that helps me ask questions that others don’t. It took me a while to talk about my experience of being undocumented, because my parents’ immigration status was still tenuous. But they’re fine now, and I’m able to speak out.What has been most shocking to you about your findings on what happens to asylum seekers?Some findings were simultaneously shocking, but also very expected since we’ve heard anecdotal reports. There were over 200 incidents of verbal abuse, dozens of instances of physical abuse and even property being taken away. I heard of someone losing their life savings.The findings about language access also really stuck out. Individuals are getting instructions about critically important steps in languages that they don’t speak: often Central American asylum speakers who speak an indigenous language by default are given instructions in Spanish. In San Diego, there are a lot of different languages – Asian Indians seeking asylum who speak Hindi were given instructions in English or Spanish. I find it hard to believe that we as a country can’t find a Hindi speaker. This is a basic due process tenet.What do we now know about the conditions people face when they are forced to return to Mexico?So many have experienced or been threatened with physical violence while waiting. Despite the handshake agreement between the United States and Mexico that Mexico is responsible for the humanitarian needs of these asylum seekers being returned, we are putting people in harm’s way by returning them to Mexico.What do you think is most important for the public to understand about the impact of Trump’s policies on asylum seekers right now?This administration wants to see net zero refugee admissions, which we are getting close to. This is a core part of the agenda. It’s not just in disregard of international and domestic law, but it’s in disregard of the fact that so many of the asylum seekers who are being turned away are seeking protection from persecution. It’s an agenda that is blind to the experiences of these families. The inevitable result is that people will be sent to circumstances where they will likely die.What do you hope is the impact of your work and your findings?I used to believe in facts swaying public opinion. But I fear we are in a political moment where the ability to select which facts to consider true is making the work we do less important. Now it may be very difficult to move public opinion when opinions are formed on such a visceral level.But facts still matter. The truth still matters, because what is happening now is the administration is often acting first, and then the courts are litigating later. So even if the public is less and less swayed by the facts on the ground, judges still are.Were there moments in your career where you found academia unwelcoming?It can be strange having lived through something and then hearing about that subject through the perspective of somebody who studies the topic, but doesn’t have that personal connection. But I do quantitative work, and at the end of the day, the data speak much louder than my own personal background.What’s the hardest part of doing academic work that is relevant to urgent policy matters?A lot of academics are just scared about being wrong and being publicly wrong. But I believe in the importance of the work, and that means I need to be confident that I can stand by it. A few years ago I thought my bar was peer review in an academic journal. Now I understand my bar to be that as well as, “Can this pass muster with a federal judge or can this withstand a deposition from attorneys for the Department of Justice?”What effect does the work have on you personally?It’s often miserable. It’s difficult to hear. It’s difficult to interact with people, to see women and little kids who are the ages of my own children in shelters in Mexico, not knowing what’s going on. It is difficult to not internalize it. But I believe in the work. If it’s not me, I’m afraid there won’t be others who step up. Because it’ll be too easy for those others who want to step up to then step out after really understanding how difficult it is to have these conversations.How do you think we can get out of this crisis moment?We have to know our immigration policy past. Every generation gets to decide for itself, whether it embraces diversity through our immigration system or pushes it away by closing our golden door. We are defining for this generation how we are answering the question of what it means to be a nation of immigrants. And we have done that historically. And in some periods in our history, we have closed our doors to immigrants, and in other periods we have opened them again. This is cyclical. It is difficult to live through, but this has been a cyclical part of our immigration policy past.Every four years we as a country get to collectively answer whether or not we still believe in this idea that we are a nation of immigrants.

He was undocumented. Now he&#39;s exposing detention center abuse,"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 17:49:46 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/undocumented-now-hes-exposing-detention-100018960.html,"Tom Wong, a UC San Diego professor, has surveyed 600 asylum seekers and says the president’s policy is ‘sending people to die’Tom Wong, a UC San Diego professor, is uncovering the abuse immigrants face in overcrowded detention facilities. Photograph: Erik Jepsen/UC San Diego PublicationsTom K Wong’s world shattered at age 16 in 1998 when his parents told him he was undocumented. The Riverside, California, teenager thought his life was over.Now 37, Wong is one of the prominent scholars in the US on immigration, most recently uncovering abuses inside detention centers in his latest University of California, San Diego research. The political science professor, whose family migrated from Hong Kong when he was two and overstayed their visas, released groundbreaking research on Tuesday on asylum seekers, exposing violence and suffering at the border as the Trump administration is escalating its crackdown on migrants.Wong surveyed more than 600 asylum seekers affected by Donald Trump’s controversial “remain in Mexico” policy, which has forced tens of thousands to return to Mexico while their cases advance. Roughly, 85% reported that immigration detention facilities failed to provide adequate food and water and that they were unable to sleep due to overcrowding, cold temperatures and other conditions. Only 20% reported being able to take care of basic hygiene, such as showering and brushing their teeth.More than half said they faced verbal abuse inside detention, with some saying they also suffered physical abuse. Roughly 25% also had their property seized when taken into detention, including important documents and cash that was not returned to them, he said.A majority said they were forced to return to Mexico without any further investigation of the violence they might face there, which Wong said was a direct violation of the policy.While waiting in Mexico, one out of four said they were threatened with physical violence, and more said they ended up homeless.Asked about Wong’s research, a spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) said the agency “provides safe, humane, clean, professionally run and appropriate conditions of confinement” and access to legal and translation services. A spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection, which also detains migrants, said it “takes allegations of mistreatment of individuals in our facilities seriously” and that employees found to violate standards “will be held accountable”.Wong talked with the Guardian about his non-traditional academic career, the crisis at the border, and how he uses his PhD to fight back. The conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.Can you tell me what it was like to discover you were undocumented?My parents told me I couldn’t go with my high school basketball team to Canada. Then they told me I couldn’t get a driver’s license. I couldn’t get a job. And there was just a cascade of no, no, no. And finally my parents said it’s not because we don’t want you to do these things, it’s because you can’t. All my hopes and dreams about growing up were literally shattered in a single moment. And it was during a time when there wasn’t the undocumented youth movement, so I wasn’t able to find other students.I grew up in a predominantly Latino neighborhood, and before I found out I was undocumented, California was becoming a ground zero for this emerging anti-immigrant movement. I remember there were policy debates with the white kids on one side, the brown kids on the other, and me feeling like I had little understanding. But everything that was being said negatively toward my Latino classmates actually applied more directly to me.How did you overcome this and become an academic?I barely graduated high school after learning I was undocumented, because at the time I thought, what’s the point? But I got married when I was 19 and I was able to adjust my immigration status. I paid for a summer politics class, and I thought if this professor can make a living teaching, maybe I can do the same.It took me years to realize I bring a different perspective to the study of immigration, politics and policy, that my history is my comparative advantage. It’s a perspective that helps me ask questions that others don’t. It took me a while to talk about my experience of being undocumented, because my parents’ immigration status was still tenuous. But they’re fine now, and I’m able to speak out.What has been most shocking to you about your findings on what happens to asylum seekers?Some findings were simultaneously shocking, but also very expected since we’ve heard anecdotal reports. There were over 200 incidents of verbal abuse, dozens of instances of physical abuse and even property being taken away. I heard of someone losing their life savings.The findings about language access also really stuck out. Individuals are getting instructions about critically important steps in languages that they don’t speak: often Central American asylum speakers who speak an indigenous language by default are given instructions in Spanish. In San Diego, there are a lot of different languages – Asian Indians seeking asylum who speak Hindi were given instructions in English or Spanish. I find it hard to believe that we as a country can’t find a Hindi speaker. This is a basic due process tenet.What do we now know about the conditions people face when they are forced to return to Mexico?So many have experienced or been threatened with physical violence while waiting. Despite the handshake agreement between the United States and Mexico that Mexico is responsible for the humanitarian needs of these asylum seekers being returned, we are putting people in harm’s way by returning them to Mexico.What do you think is most important for the public to understand about the impact of Trump’s policies on asylum seekers right now?This administration wants to see net zero refugee admissions, which we are getting close to. This is a core part of the agenda. It’s not just in disregard of international and domestic law, but it’s in disregard of the fact that so many of the asylum seekers who are being turned away are seeking protection from persecution. It’s an agenda that is blind to the experiences of these families. The inevitable result is that people will be sent to circumstances where they will likely die.What do you hope is the impact of your work and your findings?I used to believe in facts swaying public opinion. But I fear we are in a political moment where the ability to select which facts to consider true is making the work we do less important. Now it may be very difficult to move public opinion when opinions are formed on such a visceral level.But facts still matter. The truth still matters, because what is happening now is the administration is often acting first, and then the courts are litigating later. So even if the public is less and less swayed by the facts on the ground, judges still are.Were there moments in your career where you found academia unwelcoming?It can be strange having lived through something and then hearing about that subject through the perspective of somebody who studies the topic, but doesn’t have that personal connection. But I do quantitative work, and at the end of the day, the data speak much louder than my own personal background.What’s the hardest part of doing academic work that is relevant to urgent policy matters?A lot of academics are just scared about being wrong and being publicly wrong. But I believe in the importance of the work, and that means I need to be confident that I can stand by it. A few years ago I thought my bar was peer review in an academic journal. Now I understand my bar to be that as well as, “Can this pass muster with a federal judge or can this withstand a deposition from attorneys for the Department of Justice?”What effect does the work have on you personally?It’s often miserable. It’s difficult to hear. It’s difficult to interact with people, to see women and little kids who are the ages of my own children in shelters in Mexico, not knowing what’s going on. It is difficult to not internalize it. But I believe in the work. If it’s not me, I’m afraid there won’t be others who step up. Because it’ll be too easy for those others who want to step up to then step out after really understanding how difficult it is to have these conversations.How do you think we can get out of this crisis moment?We have to know our immigration policy past. Every generation gets to decide for itself, whether it embraces diversity through our immigration system or pushes it away by closing our golden door. We are defining for this generation how we are answering the question of what it means to be a nation of immigrants. And we have done that historically. And in some periods in our history, we have closed our doors to immigrants, and in other periods we have opened them again. This is cyclical. It is difficult to live through, but this has been a cyclical part of our immigration policy past.Every four years we as a country get to collectively answer whether or not we still believe in this idea that we are a nation of immigrants. In 2020, we will get to vote.",http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5mTp_BGJvUvwmexmBzFrEg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/9a0dd9c25d5ea0ca1353ff565b5c5106,He was undocumented.

He was undocumented. Now he&#39;s exposing detention center abuse,"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 17:49:46 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/undocumented-now-hes-exposing-detention-100018960.html,"Tom Wong, a UC San Diego professor, has surveyed 600 asylum seekers and says the president’s policy is ‘sending people to die’Tom Wong, a UC San Diego professor, is uncovering the abuse immigrants face in overcrowded detention facilities. Photograph: Erik Jepsen/UC San Diego PublicationsTom K Wong’s world shattered at age 16 in 1998 when his parents told him he was undocumented. The Riverside, California, teenager thought his life was over.Now 37, Wong is one of the prominent scholars in the US on immigration, most recently uncovering abuses inside detention centers in his latest University of California, San Diego research. The political science professor, whose family migrated from Hong Kong when he was two and overstayed their visas, released groundbreaking research on Tuesday on asylum seekers, exposing violence and suffering at the border as the Trump administration is escalating its crackdown on migrants.Wong surveyed more than 600 asylum seekers affected by Donald Trump’s controversial “remain in Mexico” policy, which has forced tens of thousands to return to Mexico while their cases advance. Roughly, 85% reported that immigration detention facilities failed to provide adequate food and water and that they were unable to sleep due to overcrowding, cold temperatures and other conditions. Only 20% reported being able to take care of basic hygiene, such as showering and brushing their teeth.More than half said they faced verbal abuse inside detention, with some saying they also suffered physical abuse. Roughly 25% also had their property seized when taken into detention, including important documents and cash that was not returned to them, he said.A majority said they were forced to return to Mexico without any further investigation of the violence they might face there, which Wong said was a direct violation of the policy.While waiting in Mexico, one out of four said they were threatened with physical violence, and more said they ended up homeless.Asked about Wong’s research, a spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) said the agency “provides safe, humane, clean, professionally run and appropriate conditions of confinement” and access to legal and translation services. A spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection, which also detains migrants, said it “takes allegations of mistreatment of individuals in our facilities seriously” and that employees found to violate standards “will be held accountable”.Wong talked with the Guardian about his non-traditional academic career, the crisis at the border, and how he uses his PhD to fight back. The conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.Can you tell me what it was like to discover you were undocumented?My parents told me I couldn’t go with my high school basketball team to Canada. Then they told me I couldn’t get a driver’s license. I couldn’t get a job. And there was just a cascade of no, no, no. And finally my parents said it’s not because we don’t want you to do these things, it’s because you can’t. All my hopes and dreams about growing up were literally shattered in a single moment. And it was during a time when there wasn’t the undocumented youth movement, so I wasn’t able to find other students.I grew up in a predominantly Latino neighborhood, and before I found out I was undocumented, California was becoming a ground zero for this emerging anti-immigrant movement. I remember there were policy debates with the white kids on one side, the brown kids on the other, and me feeling like I had little understanding. But everything that was being said negatively toward my Latino classmates actually applied more directly to me.How did you overcome this and become an academic?I barely graduated high school after learning I was undocumented, because at the time I thought, what’s the point? But I got married when I was 19 and I was able to adjust my immigration status. I paid for a summer politics class, and I thought if this professor can make a living teaching, maybe I can do the same.It took me years to realize I bring a different perspective to the study of immigration, politics and policy, that my history is my comparative advantage. It’s a perspective that helps me ask questions that others don’t. It took me a while to talk about my experience of being undocumented, because my parents’ immigration status was still tenuous. But they’re fine now, and I’m able to speak out.What has been most shocking to you about your findings on what happens to asylum seekers?Some findings were simultaneously shocking, but also very expected since we’ve heard anecdotal reports. There were over 200 incidents of verbal abuse, dozens of instances of physical abuse and even property being taken away. I heard of someone losing their life savings.The findings about language access also really stuck out. Individuals are getting instructions about critically important steps in languages that they don’t speak: often Central American asylum speakers who speak an indigenous language by default are given instructions in Spanish. In San Diego, there are a lot of different languages – Asian Indians seeking asylum who speak Hindi were given instructions in English or Spanish. I find it hard to believe that we as a country can’t find a Hindi speaker. This is a basic due process tenet.What do we now know about the conditions people face when they are forced to return to Mexico?So many have experienced or been threatened with physical violence while waiting. Despite the handshake agreement between the United States and Mexico that Mexico is responsible for the humanitarian needs of these asylum seekers being returned, we are putting people in harm’s way by returning them to Mexico.What do you think is most important for the public to understand about the impact of Trump’s policies on asylum seekers right now?This administration wants to see net zero refugee admissions, which we are getting close to. This is a core part of the agenda. It’s not just in disregard of international and domestic law, but it’s in disregard of the fact that so many of the asylum seekers who are being turned away are seeking protection from persecution. It’s an agenda that is blind to the experiences of these families. The inevitable result is that people will be sent to circumstances where they will likely die.What do you hope is the impact of your work and your findings?I used to believe in facts swaying public opinion. But I fear we are in a political moment where the ability to select which facts to consider true is making the work we do less important. Now it may be very difficult to move public opinion when opinions are formed on such a visceral level.But facts still matter. The truth still matters, because what is happening now is the administration is often acting first, and then the courts are litigating later. So even if the public is less and less swayed by the facts on the ground, judges still are.Were there moments in your career where you found academia unwelcoming?It can be strange having lived through something and then hearing about that subject through the perspective of somebody who studies the topic, but doesn’t have that personal connection. But I do quantitative work, and at the end of the day, the data speak much louder than my own personal background.What’s the hardest part of doing academic work that is relevant to urgent policy matters?A lot of academics are just scared about being wrong and being publicly wrong. But I believe in the importance of the work, and that means I need to be confident that I can stand by it. A few years ago I thought my bar was peer review in an academic journal. Now I understand my bar to be that as well as, “Can this pass muster with a federal judge or can this withstand a deposition from attorneys for the Department of Justice?”What effect does the work have on you personally?It’s often miserable. It’s difficult to hear. It’s difficult to interact with people, to see women and little kids who are the ages of my own children in shelters in Mexico, not knowing what’s going on. It is difficult to not internalize it. But I believe in the work. If it’s not me, I’m afraid there won’t be others who step up. Because it’ll be too easy for those others who want to step up to then step out after really understanding how difficult it is to have these conversations.How do you think we can get out of this crisis moment?We have to know our immigration policy past. Every generation gets to decide for itself, whether it embraces diversity through our immigration system or pushes it away by closing our golden door. We are defining for this generation how we are answering the question of what it means to be a nation of immigrants. And we have done that historically. And in some periods in our history, we have closed our doors to immigrants, and in other periods we have opened them again. This is cyclical. It is difficult to live through, but this has been a cyclical part of our immigration policy past.Every four years we as a country get to collectively answer whether or not we still believe in this idea that we are a nation of immigrants. In 2020, we will get to vote.",http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5mTp_BGJvUvwmexmBzFrEg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/9a0dd9c25d5ea0ca1353ff565b5c5106,He was undocumented.

And finally my parents said it’s not because we don’t want you to do these things, it’s because you can’t. All my hopes and dreams about growing up were literally shattered in a single moment. And it was during a time when there wasn’t the undocumented youth movement, so I wasn’t able to find other students.I grew up in a predominantly Latino neighborhood, and before I found out I was undocumented, California was becoming a ground zero for this emerging anti-immigrant movement. I remember there were policy debates with the white kids on one side, the brown kids on the other, and me feeling like I had little understanding. But everything that was being said negatively toward my Latino classmates actually applied more directly to me.How did you overcome this and become an academic?I barely graduated high school after learning I was undocumented, because at the time I thought, what’s the point? But I got married when I was 19 and I was able to adjust my immigration status. I paid for a summer politics class, and I thought if this professor can make a living teaching, maybe I can do the same.It took me years to realize I bring a different perspective to the study of immigration, politics and policy, that my history is my comparative advantage. It’s a perspective that helps me ask questions that others don’t. It took me a while to talk about my experience of being undocumented, because my parents’ immigration status was still tenuous. But they’re fine now, and I’m able to speak out.What has been most shocking to you about your findings on what happens to asylum seekers?Some findings were simultaneously shocking, but also very expected since we’ve heard anecdotal reports. There were over 200 incidents of verbal abuse, dozens of instances of physical abuse and even property being taken away. I heard of someone losing their life savings.The findings about language access also really stuck out. Individuals are getting instructions about critically important steps in languages that they don’t speak: often Central American asylum speakers who speak an indigenous language by default are given instructions in Spanish. In San Diego, there are a lot of different languages – Asian Indians seeking asylum who speak Hindi were given instructions in English or Spanish. I find it hard to believe that we as a country can’t find a Hindi speaker. This is a basic due process tenet.What do we now know about the conditions people face when they are forced to return to Mexico?So many have experienced or been threatened with physical violence while waiting. Despite the handshake agreement between the United States and Mexico that Mexico is responsible for the humanitarian needs of these asylum seekers being returned, we are putting people in harm’s way by returning them to Mexico.What do you think is most important for the public to understand about the impact of Trump’s policies on asylum seekers right now?This administration wants to see net zero refugee admissions, which we are getting close to. This is a core part of the agenda. It’s not just in disregard of international and domestic law, but it’s in disregard of the fact that so many of the asylum seekers who are being turned away are seeking protection from persecution. It’s an agenda that is blind to the experiences of these families. The inevitable result is that people will be sent to circumstances where they will likely die.What do you hope is the impact of your work and your findings?I used to believe in facts swaying public opinion. But I fear we are in a political moment where the ability to select which facts to consider true is making the work we do less important. Now it may be very difficult to move public opinion when opinions are formed on such a visceral level.But facts still matter. The truth still matters, because what is happening now is the administration is often acting first, and then the courts are litigating later. So even if the public is less and less swayed by the facts on the ground, judges still are.Were there moments in your career where you found academia unwelcoming?It can be strange having lived through something and then hearing about that subject through the perspective of somebody who studies the topic, but doesn’t have that personal connection. But I do quantitative work, and at the end of the day, the data speak much louder than my own personal background.What’s the hardest part of doing academic work that is relevant to urgent policy matters?A lot of academics are just scared about being wrong and being publicly wrong. But I believe in the importance of the work, and that means I need to be confident that I can stand by it. A few years ago I thought my bar was peer review in an academic journal. Now I understand my bar to be that as well as, “Can this pass muster with a federal judge or can this withstand a deposition from attorneys for the Department of Justice?”What effect does the work have on you personally?It’s often miserable. It’s difficult to hear. It’s difficult to interact with people, to see women and little kids who are the ages of my own children in shelters in Mexico, not knowing what’s going on. It is difficult to not internalize it. But I believe in the work. If it’s not me, I’m afraid there won’t be others who step up. Because it’ll be too easy for those others who want to step up to then step out after really understanding how difficult it is to have these conversations.How do you think we can get out of this crisis moment?We have to know our immigration policy past. Every generation gets to decide for itself, whether it embraces diversity through our immigration system or pushes it away by closing our golden door. We are defining for this generation how we are answering the question of what it means to be a nation of immigrants. And we have done that historically. And in some periods in our history, we have closed our doors to immigrants, and in other periods we have opened them again. This is cyclical. It is difficult to live through, but this has been a cyclical part of our immigration policy past.Every four years we as a country get to collectively answer whether or not we still believe in this idea that we are a nation of immigrants. In 2020, we will get to vote.",http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5mTp_BGJvUvwmexmBzFrEg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/9a0dd9c25d5ea0ca1353ff565b5c5106,He was undocumented.

"Pelosi, Schiff Prep for GOP Impeachment ‘Stunts’ and Attempts to Out the Whistleblower","Tue, 29 Oct 2019 15:31:34 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/pelosi-schiff-prep-gop-impeachment-193134453.html,"Congressional Democrats are struggling to protect the identity of the U.S. government official who filed a whistleblower complaint about President Donald Trump’s Ukraine policy. And those efforts have fueled friction behind closed doors. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) ruled in a closed-door deposition Tuesday morning that any questions that might lead to the revelation of the whistleblower’s identity were out of order, according to two sources familiar with the meeting. His move frustrated Republicans. One source relayed that Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) ended up “yelling at each other” during a closed door deposition of Alexander Vindman, the National Security Council Director for European Affairs who testified that he raised internal concerns about Trump’s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that is now at the center of the impeachment inquiry.Meadows declined to discuss the deposition, but acknowledged the tension. “There is a great frustration among some of my Democratic colleagues because I know the rules extremely well,” he told The Daily Beast.Schiff’s office declined to comment. House Democrats Plan an Impeachment BlitzTuesday’s tensions underscored a growing fear among Democrats that Republicans may use parliamentary maneuvers to cast doubt on the whistleblower’s complaint and disrupt future private and public impeachment hearings. Top congressional Democrats, including members of the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees, have been meeting privately for weeks to discuss messaging around the impeachment inquiry. And in a meeting on Tuesday morning, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and other attendees discussed how to handle potential Republican efforts to reveal the whistleblower’s identity, according to two sources familiar with the talks. A third source who was in the meeting said they were not aware of discussion about protecting the whistleblower’s identity. But the source did say that a good chunk of the discussion focused on how to handle Republican-led attempts to disrupt future public hearings, which impeachment investigators officially teed up on Tuesday. Some Democratic members have raised concerns that hearings could become chaotic political circuses with GOP lawmakers using the parliamentary rules to bog down the sessions. Republican members have used such tactics successfully during Judiciary Committee hearings led by Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.)—most notably when Trump’s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski spent much of his time refusing to answer questions and berating his questioners. That hearing embarrassed many Democrats and was widely viewed as a mess, underscoring the need for new direction and leadership in oversight of the Trump White House. Going forward, the third source said, Democrats wanted to better prepare for such “stunts” by setting firm rules for hearings. “It is going to happen at every turn, so we have to be prepared to address it,” the source said. “So we may do it through the rule. And we need to come up with a message to deal with this.”The House Rules Committee is slated to vote on formal rules of the impeachment hearings on Wednesday, and the full House could vote on the new rules as soon as Thursday.Meadows said that any accusation that Republicans were trying to out the whistleblower were untrue because they did not know who to actually out. “We don’t know who the whistleblower is, so there’s no way that we can out someone that we don’t know who it is,” he said. “I do believe that we need to hear from the whistleblower, but in terms of any ability to out the whistleblower, you have to know the name of him or her first and I can assure you that there’s not a single Republican that knows the name of the whistleblower.”Nunes Aide Is Leaking the Ukraine Whistleblower’s Name, Sources SaySources have told The Daily Beast a different story. According to two knowledgeable people, a top staffer to Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) has been circulating the identity of a person believed to be the whistleblower among House Republicans.On Tuesday, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) exited the deposition and railed against Republican lawmakers for seemingly spending “most of their hours” of questioning using a variety of tactics to try to get Vindman to reveal the whistleblower’s name. She said that Republicans had been “repeatedly halted” from asking about the whistleblower during the session. “It certainly appeared they were trying to make sure they could put a universe of individuals who had been communicated with on the table,” Wasserman Schultz told The Daily Beast during a break in the deposition.

Trump Sides With Indicted Oligarch Over His Own Diplomat,"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 19:10:45 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/trump-sides-indicted-oligarch-over-231045762.html,"Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump boosted a tweet Monday promoting a controversial allegation from an indicted Ukrainian oligarch: that a top U.S. diplomat put fabricated information about the mogul in a diplomatic cable. That diplomat happens to be one of Democrats’ key impeachment witnesses. And that oligarch happens to have a long-standing beef with Joe Biden.Scott Adams, a Washington, D.C., talk radio host, sent out a tweet Monday night about U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor, who delivered some of the impeachment inquiry’s most damaging testimony yet. The tweet alleged that Taylor lied about Ukrainian natural gas baron Dmytro Firtash in a cable to State Department headquarters in 2008. At issue was a conversation Taylor had with Firtash in Kyiv that December. Taylor wrote in a diplomatic cable (later published by WikiLeaks) that Firtash told him he had “acknowledged ties to Russian organized crime figure [Semion] Seymon Mogilevich,” one of the most notorious accused mobsters on the planet. According to Taylor, Firtash said “he needed Mogilevich's approval to get into business in the first place,” but had not committed any crimes in the course of his business.When WikiLeaks published the cable in 2010, Firtash issued a statement on his website disputing its contents. Firtash, the statement claimed,“has never stated, to anyone, at any time, that he needed or received permission from Mr. Mogilevich to establish any of his businesses.”Earlier this year, Firtash reiterated that defense. Without mentioning any American official by name, he said someone must have fabricated the detail about Mogilevich. Taylor, meanwhile, has defended the State Department’s notes. The Justice Department appears to side with Taylor; its lawyers have argued in court that Firtash has ties to Russian organized crime. The criminal charges he faces, however, don’t involve any such alleged relationships. Instead, the Justice Department charged him in 2014 with helming a conspiracy to bribe Indian government officials. Trump’s retweet, however, offers a presidential thumbs-up to Firtash’s side of the story, and raises a new line of attack on Taylor’s credibility for the president’s allies.  Asked about his sourcing for the allegations against Taylor, Adams told The Daily Beast, “My sources are solid Foggy Bottom people.” He also noted the explanation for the cable that Firtash provided to The Daily Beast earlier this year.This specific defense of Firtash took hold in The Hill over the summer, when columnist John Solomon, whose articles informed Rudy Giuliani’s Biden-Ukraine investigation, published a piece in July claiming that Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s deputy said Firtash’s criminal charges in the U.S. might “go away” if he shared damaging information about Trump with Mueller’s team. Solomon cited “multiple sources with direct knowledge” and contemporaneous memos. Firtash and Solomon share the same lawyers: Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova. The husband-wife team are veterans of the conservative movement’s most contentious legal battles, with longstanding ties in the Justice Department and Trump administration. Ukrainian Oligarch Seethed About ‘Overlord’ Biden for YearsRead more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

US helicopter raid reported in Syria after trove of Baghdadi intelligence taken,"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 14:29:53 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/us-helicopter-raid-reported-syria-135329505.html,"The US is believed to have carried out fresh raids on suspected senior Islamic State members in Syria overnight, as officials assessed a treasure trove of intelligence gathered from Isil leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s final hideout. Helicopters reported to be from the US-led coalition flew late on Monday night into al-Shuyukh village south of Jarablus, around three miles from a raid the previous day that killed Isil’s spokesman Abu Hassan al-Muhajir. Donald Trump, the US president, tweeted on Tuesday that Baghdadi's ""number one replacement"" had been killed. He did not name who that was, but it is thought he was referring to Muhajir. Analysts do not agree that Muhajir would have been Baghdadi's natural successor.  Just confirmed that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s number one replacement has been terminated by American troops. Most likely would have taken the top spot - Now he is also Dead!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2019 A spokesman for the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which is believed to have jointly conducted the mission, said there had been a “successful raid targeting and arresting senior Isil members” on Monday night without elaborating. Local sources reported that the mission lasted no more than 20 minutes and no clashes were heard. “An Iraqi family had moved there in recent times,” Aghiad al-Kheder, co-founder of anti-Isil activist group Sound and Picture, told the Telegraph. “We think two men were taken away by the helicopters.” The men’s identity, or relationship to Baghdadi, was not immediately known. “We think it's related to the Baghdadi raid,” said Mr Kheder, whose group has sources on the ground in the area. ”For sure US found important documents and maybe in the next few days we will see many operations like this.” Pentagon officials told the Washington Post that the documents and other information gathered during the raid on the compound in Barisha in Idlib province close to the Turkish border would prove useful in hunting down remaining senior Isil figures. The officials said two men were also captured alive in the raid who they hoped could provide intelligence about the group. Evidence was growing that Isil had an established smuggling ring, taking senior members from Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria and Qaim in western Iraqi to Idlib. The last moments of Islamic State leader Kurdish spies cultivated a source inside Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s inner circle who was able to steal the Islamic State leader’s underwear for DNA sampling and provide a detailed layout of his compound ahead of the US raid, the SDF commander said.  Mazloum Kobani Abdi, the head of the SDF, told NBC his intelligence officers had turned one of Baghdadi’s security advisors who was able to give critical information about the jihadist leader’s house and the tunnels beneath it.  The source took a pair of Baghdadi’s underwear and a blood sample to help US forces confirm who was hiding in the compound. The source was at the site on the night of the raid and was whisked out by US commandos. Polat Can, a senior adviser to the SDF, revealed more detailed information about the group's role in finding Baghdadi.  ""Since 15 May, we have been working together with the CIA,” said Polat Can, a senior adviser to the SDF. He said their surveillance tracked the 48-year-old reclusive leader moving to the village of Barisha in northern Idlib from northern Deir Ezzor in April. Iraqi officials confirmed to the Telegraph that they had arrested members of Baghdadi’s inner circle who were part of the ring and gave up the leader’s location. It is thought fighters with the Islamist group Hurras al-Din, an al-Qaeda-aligned group which is usually hostile to Isil, were also facilitating senior Isil leaders’ movement through rebel-held Idlib. Baghdadi was discovered at the house of one Hurras al-Din commander, Abu Mohamed al-Halabi, who was killed in the raid. Mustafa Bali, SDF’s spokesman, said that Muhajir, described as Baghdadi’s right-hand man, was believed to have been in the area in order to facilitate Baghdadi’s movements in Idlib and possibly on to Turkey. Muhajir was targeted in the village of Ain al-Baydah near Turkish-administered Jarablus with the help of SDF intelligence. Local sources said Muhajir had been travelling in a convoy made up of an oil tanker and a car. The SDF has questioned how Ankara was not aware of the presence of Baghdadi and other senior leaders so close to areas in Syria under its control.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/B6KeUW_UtUzwNngkCtKRHg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/71d3f202cf4591cbce4db9a6c924df4d,US helicopter raid reported in Syria after trove of Baghdadi intelligence taken

U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell on Friday ordered President Donald Trump's administration to hand over by Wednesday a copy of the Mueller report that included material that had been blacked out.  The department is trying to block Democrats from accessing the full Mueller report on the grounds that doing so would require the disclosure of secret grand jury materials and potentially harm ongoing investigations.,http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Fz1VCBgFGaVmKO3x5szMOQ--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters.com/eb5d09674854a637e10155f5ff0e2aed,U.S. appeals court blocks release of unredacted Mueller report pending appeal

What Baghdadi’s Death Means for al Qaeda—and Why It Matters,"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 13:14:08 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/baghdadi-death-means-al-qaeda-171408420.html,"SITE Intelligence GroupWith ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi killed one day and the group’s official spokesman Abu Hassan al-Muhajir the next, there’s a giant hole in the pseudo-Caliphate structure of the so-called Islamic State. The group must now, by its strict religious tenets, find a new (supposed) descendant of the Prophet Muhammed to fill the role of Caliph. But the deaths of those two are equally consequential for al-Qaeda, the bitter rival of ISIS for leadership of global jihad. Al-Qaeda has spent the last six years branding the Caliphate as illegitimate, too extreme, and ultimately harmful. When ISIS declared the establishment of its so-called Caliphate spanning territory in Syria and Iraq in 2014, al-Qaeda and its affiliates unanimously rejected it. To this day, al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri’s speeches rarely come without some critique of the “epidemic” put forth by ISIS.Trump Officials Had No Clue Where He Got ‘Whimpering’ Detail in His Baghdadi Raid AccountOddly, Baghdadi was killed in Idlib, a haven of al-Qaeda-linked fighters and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a Syrian Islamist faction led by Abu Muhammad al-Julani, a former al-Qaeda comrade who had become one of Baghdadi's most bitter foes. There has been some speculation Baghdadi was not just hiding out but trying to recruit from the ranks of his enemies.Neither al-Qaeda Central nor its affiliates have commented on Baghdadi’s death as yet, but within hours after the news broke, al-Qaeda ideologues and supporters already were celebrating the event and discussing what it will mean for the future of jihad. In chat groups online, al-Qaeda supporters voiced resentment after years of bitter strife with the group, and the scale of these responses illustrates just how much of a big deal and opportunity they see with Baghdadi’s death.“Based on his orders, thousands of the mujahideen were killed,” one post read.“How thrilled were they every time leaders from al-Qaeda were martyred?” read another.Some wished Baghdadi the ultimate condemnation:  “May Allah send him to Hell.”Messages by others, however, particularly al-Qaeda-linked ideologues, balanced expressions of justice for the jihadi movement with restraint, making sure not to celebrate excessively the result of an operation by the United States.The tactful enthusiasm is calculated. Many ISIS fighters, much of its military infrastructure, many media officials, and supporters were pulled from al-Qaeda. Now, with ISIS’ “Caliph” dead and that Caliphate itself destroyed, al-Qaeda has been given its biggest opportunity yet to bring many of them back under its tent. SITE Intelligence GroupPerhaps the most profound instance of this outreach was a lengthy essay by “Adel Amin,” the pen name of a prominent ideologue linked to the Shabaab al-Mujahideen Movement, al-Qaeda’s branch in Somalia and most powerful affiliate. The message, disseminated widely across al-Qaeda-supporting channels and chat groups (many of which are also frequented by pro-ISIS users), demanded that ISIS supporters “return to the road of righteousness” after the Islamic State, in all of its excessive aggression and delusions of destiny, has proven itself a failure. Amin wrote:The situation here is not one in which to gloat. It is a situation for reminding and calling on those who remained in the ranks of al-Baghdadi, to reconsider… Indeed, we witnessed its back being broken, its leaders getting killed, and its banner falling, and we hope that we can witness whoever remains from its soldiers returning to righteousness.Statements by other ideologues and supporters voiced the same points. A statement by Sirajuddin Zurayqat, a former religious official in the now-defunct al-Qaeda-linked Brigades of Abdullah Azzam in Lebanon, urged: “Now [Baghdadi] is dead and there is not one from the Ummah grieving over him or giving condolences... Therefore, those who were deceived by him should reconsider before it is too late!”These messages echo the same calls heard from Zawahiri and al-Qaeda affiliates over the years calling on ISIS fighters to “repent” and leave the group. Yet despite these new circumstances, ISIS supporters will not easily be moved. Since the summer of 2016, the group’s followers have seen the loss of the major cities Mosul in Iraq and Raqqah in Syria as well as the death of revered ISIS figures like Omar Shishani, Abu Muhammad al-‘Adnani, and others. With the latest setbacks to its leadership, ISIS-linked accounts online already have poured out calls to stay steadfast and have even used Baghdadi’s death as a rallying point to carry out new attacks. Reinforcing this undeterred support is an ISIS military and media machine that has shown no sign of stopping in the last two days. While ISIS has not yet officially acknowledged the death of Baghdadi, it has continued reporting on day-to-day military activity across Iraq, Syria, and the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.ISIS' Yemen Province - AQAP Prisoners as Featured in the video “He Who Starts is More Unjust”SITE Intelligence GroupFurthermore, while al-Qaeda affiliates like the Shabaab serve as powerful representatives of the organization, al-Qaeda Central is weaker than it has ever been. These days, al-Qaeda Central’s role is largely symbolic, limited to leadership messages and other content while steering the big-picture ethos of the organization. Its attempts to bolster its image, already heavily weighed down by a less-than-charismatic leader in Zawahiri, were upended upon the death of Hamza bin Laden, the son of Osama, whom al-Qaeda likely was grooming for an eventual leadership position. These variables considered, al-Qaeda may not be the appealing alternative for jihadists that its supporters want it to seem. So, while some fighters might very well join the ranks of al-Qaeda affiliates in their region, we shouldn't expect to see any drastic migration from ISIS’ ranks into its rival’s.Despite any notions of good-riddance that al-Qaeda and its supporters attach to Baghdadi’s death, and for whatever number of defectors it may win over as a result of Baghdadi’s demise, ISIS is not going anywhere. The barriers between these terrorist organizations have only hardened over the years, fueling deadly clashes and jihadi PR wars. Baghdadi was not the sole barrier keeping ISIS members from joining al-Qaeda, and his death is unlikely to diminish existing disputes.How U.S. Commandos IDed a ‘Mutilated’ Baghdadi So QuicklyRead more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

US helicopter raid reported in Syria after trove of Baghdadi intelligence taken,"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 14:29:53 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/us-helicopter-raid-reported-syria-135329505.html,"The US is believed to have carried out fresh raids on suspected senior Islamic State members in Syria overnight, as officials assessed a treasure trove of intelligence gathered from Isil leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s final hideout. Helicopters reported to be from the US-led coalition flew late on Monday night into al-Shuyukh village south of Jarablus, around three miles from a raid the previous day that killed Isil’s spokesman Abu Hassan al-Muhajir. Donald Trump, the US president, tweeted on Tuesday that Baghdadi's ""number one replacement"" had been killed. He did not name who that was, but it is thought he was referring to Muhajir. Analysts do not agree that Muhajir would have been Baghdadi's natural successor.  Just confirmed that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s number one replacement has been terminated by American troops. Most likely would have taken the top spot - Now he is also Dead!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2019 A spokesman for the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which is believed to have jointly conducted the mission, said there had been a “successful raid targeting and arresting senior Isil members” on Monday night without elaborating. Local sources reported that the mission lasted no more than 20 minutes and no clashes were heard. “An Iraqi family had moved there in recent times,” Aghiad al-Kheder, co-founder of anti-Isil activist group Sound and Picture, told the Telegraph. “We think two men were taken away by the helicopters.” The men’s identity, or relationship to Baghdadi, was not immediately known. “We think it's related to the Baghdadi raid,” said Mr Kheder, whose group has sources on the ground in the area. ”For sure US found important documents and maybe in the next few days we will see many operations like this.” Pentagon officials told the Washington Post that the documents and other information gathered during the raid on the compound in Barisha in Idlib province close to the Turkish border would prove useful in hunting down remaining senior Isil figures. The officials said two men were also captured alive in the raid who they hoped could provide intelligence about the group. Evidence was growing that Isil had an established smuggling ring, taking senior members from Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria and Qaim in western Iraqi to Idlib. The last moments of Islamic State leader Kurdish spies cultivated a source inside Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s inner circle who was able to steal the Islamic State leader’s underwear for DNA sampling and provide a detailed layout of his compound ahead of the US raid, the SDF commander said.  Mazloum Kobani Abdi, the head of the SDF, told NBC his intelligence officers had turned one of Baghdadi’s security advisors who was able to give critical information about the jihadist leader’s house and the tunnels beneath it.  The source took a pair of Baghdadi’s underwear and a blood sample to help US forces confirm who was hiding in the compound. The source was at the site on the night of the raid and was whisked out by US commandos. Polat Can, a senior adviser to the SDF, revealed more detailed information about the group's role in finding Baghdadi.  ""Since 15 May, we have been working together with the CIA,” said Polat Can, a senior adviser to the SDF. He said their surveillance tracked the 48-year-old reclusive leader moving to the village of Barisha in northern Idlib from northern Deir Ezzor in April. Iraqi officials confirmed to the Telegraph that they had arrested members of Baghdadi’s inner circle who were part of the ring and gave up the leader’s location. It is thought fighters with the Islamist group Hurras al-Din, an al-Qaeda-aligned group which is usually hostile to Isil, were also facilitating senior Isil leaders’ movement through rebel-held Idlib. Baghdadi was discovered at the house of one Hurras al-Din commander, Abu Mohamed al-Halabi, who was killed in the raid. Mustafa Bali, SDF’s spokesman, said that Muhajir, described as Baghdadi’s right-hand man, was believed to have been in the area in order to facilitate Baghdadi’s movements in Idlib and possibly on to Turkey. Muhajir was targeted in the village of Ain al-Baydah near Turkish-administered Jarablus with the help of SDF intelligence. Local sources said Muhajir had been travelling in a convoy made up of an oil tanker and a car. The SDF has questioned how Ankara was not aware of the presence of Baghdadi and other senior leaders so close to areas in Syria under its control.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/B6KeUW_UtUzwNngkCtKRHg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/71d3f202cf4591cbce4db9a6c924df4d,US helicopter raid reported in Syria after trove of Baghdadi intelligence taken

Analysts do not agree that Muhajir would have been Baghdadi's natural successor.  Just confirmed that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s number one replacement has been terminated by American troops. Most likely would have taken the top spot - Now he is also Dead!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2019 A spokesman for the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which is believed to have jointly conducted the mission, said there had been a “successful raid targeting and arresting senior Isil members” on Monday night without elaborating. Local sources reported that the mission lasted no more than 20 minutes and no clashes were heard. “An Iraqi family had moved there in recent times,” Aghiad al-Kheder, co-founder of anti-Isil activist group Sound and Picture, told the Telegraph. “We think two men were taken away by the helicopters.” The men’s identity, or relationship to Baghdadi, was not immediately known. “We think it's related to the Baghdadi raid,” said Mr Kheder, whose group has sources on the ground in the area. ”For sure US found important documents and maybe in the next few days we will see many operations like this.” Pentagon officials told the Washington Post that the documents and other information gathered during the raid on the compound in Barisha in Idlib province close to the Turkish border would prove useful in hunting down remaining senior Isil figures. The officials said two men were also captured alive in the raid who they hoped could provide intelligence about the group. Evidence was growing that Isil had an established smuggling ring, taking senior members from Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria and Qaim in western Iraqi to Idlib. The last moments of Islamic State leader Kurdish spies cultivated a source inside Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s inner circle who was able to steal the Islamic State leader’s underwear for DNA sampling and provide a detailed layout of his compound ahead of the US raid, the SDF commander said.  Mazloum Kobani Abdi, the head of the SDF, told NBC his intelligence officers had turned one of Baghdadi’s security advisors who was able to give critical information about the jihadist leader’s house and the tunnels beneath it.  The source took a pair of Baghdadi’s underwear and a blood sample to help US forces confirm who was hiding in the compound. The source was at the site on the night of the raid and was whisked out by US commandos. Polat Can, a senior adviser to the SDF, revealed more detailed information about the group's role in finding Baghdadi.  ""Since 15 May, we have been working together with the CIA,” said Polat Can, a senior adviser to the SDF. He said their surveillance tracked the 48-year-old reclusive leader moving to the village of Barisha in northern Idlib from northern Deir Ezzor in April. Iraqi officials confirmed to the Telegraph that they had arrested members of Baghdadi’s inner circle who were part of the ring and gave up the leader’s location. It is thought fighters with the Islamist group Hurras al-Din, an al-Qaeda-aligned group which is usually hostile to Isil, were also facilitating senior Isil leaders’ movement through rebel-held Idlib. Baghdadi was discovered at the house of one Hurras al-Din commander, Abu Mohamed al-Halabi, who was killed in the raid. Mustafa Bali, SDF’s spokesman, said that Muhajir, described as Baghdadi’s right-hand man, was believed to have been in the area in order to facilitate Baghdadi’s movements in Idlib and possibly on to Turkey. Muhajir was targeted in the village of Ain al-Baydah near Turkish-administered Jarablus with the help of SDF intelligence. Local sources said Muhajir had been travelling in a convoy made up of an oil tanker and a car. The SDF has questioned how Ankara was not aware of the presence of Baghdadi and other senior leaders so close to areas in Syria under its control.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/B6KeUW_UtUzwNngkCtKRHg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/71d3f202cf4591cbce4db9a6c924df4d,US helicopter raid reported in Syria after trove of Baghdadi intelligence taken

He was undocumented.

Photograph: Erik Jepsen/UC San Diego PublicationsTom K Wong’s world shattered at age 16 in 1998 when his parents told him he was undocumented. The Riverside, California, teenager thought his life was over.Now 37, Wong is one of the prominent scholars in the US on immigration, most recently uncovering abuses inside detention centers in his latest University of California, San Diego research. The political science professor, whose family migrated from Hong Kong when he was two and overstayed their visas, released groundbreaking research on Tuesday on asylum seekers, exposing violence and suffering at the border as the Trump administration is escalating its crackdown on migrants.Wong surveyed more than 600 asylum seekers affected by Donald Trump’s controversial “remain in Mexico” policy, which has forced tens of thousands to return to Mexico while their cases advance. Roughly, 85% reported that immigration detention facilities failed to provide adequate food and water and that they were unable to sleep due to overcrowding, cold temperatures and other conditions. Only 20% reported being able to take care of basic hygiene, such as showering and brushing their teeth.More than half said they faced verbal abuse inside detention, with some saying they also suffered physical abuse. Roughly 25% also had their property seized when taken into detention, including important documents and cash that was not returned to them, he said.A majority said they were forced to return to Mexico without any further investigation of the violence they might face there, which Wong said was a direct violation of the policy.While waiting in Mexico, one out of four said they were threatened with physical violence, and more said they ended up homeless.Asked about Wong’s research, a spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) said the agency “provides safe, humane, clean, professionally run and appropriate conditions of confinement” and access to legal and translation services. A spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection, which also detains migrants, said it “takes allegations of mistreatment of individuals in our facilities seriously” and that employees found to violate standards “will be held accountable”.Wong talked with the Guardian about his non-traditional academic career, the crisis at the border, and how he uses his PhD to fight back. The conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.Can you tell me what it was like to discover you were undocumented?My parents told me I couldn’t go with my high school basketball team to Canada. Then they told me I couldn’t get a driver’s license. I couldn’t get a job. And there was just a cascade of no, no, no. And finally my parents said it’s not because we don’t want you to do these things, it’s because you can’t. All my hopes and dreams about growing up were literally shattered in a single moment. And it was during a time when there wasn’t the undocumented youth movement, so I wasn’t able to find other students.I grew up in a predominantly Latino neighborhood, and before I found out I was undocumented, California was becoming a ground zero for this emerging anti-immigrant movement. I remember there were policy debates with the white kids on one side, the brown kids on the other, and me feeling like I had little understanding. But everything that was being said negatively toward my Latino classmates actually applied more directly to me.How did you overcome this and become an academic?I barely graduated high school after learning I was undocumented, because at the time I thought, what’s the point? But I got married when I was 19 and I was able to adjust my immigration status. I paid for a summer politics class, and I thought if this professor can make a living teaching, maybe I can do the same.It took me years to realize I bring a different perspective to the study of immigration, politics and policy, that my history is my comparative advantage. It’s a perspective that helps me ask questions that others don’t. It took me a while to talk about my experience of being undocumented, because my parents’ immigration status was still tenuous. But they’re fine now, and I’m able to speak out.What has been most shocking to you about your findings on what happens to asylum seekers?Some findings were simultaneously shocking, but also very expected since we’ve heard anecdotal reports. There were over 200 incidents of verbal abuse, dozens of instances of physical abuse and even property being taken away. I heard of someone losing their life savings.The findings about language access also really stuck out. Individuals are getting instructions about critically important steps in languages that they don’t speak: often Central American asylum speakers who speak an indigenous language by default are given instructions in Spanish. In San Diego, there are a lot of different languages – Asian Indians seeking asylum who speak Hindi were given instructions in English or Spanish. I find it hard to believe that we as a country can’t find a Hindi speaker. This is a basic due process tenet.What do we now know about the conditions people face when they are forced to return to Mexico?So many have experienced or been threatened with physical violence while waiting. Despite the handshake agreement between the United States and Mexico that Mexico is responsible for the humanitarian needs of these asylum seekers being returned, we are putting people in harm’s way by returning them to Mexico.What do you think is most important for the public to understand about the impact of Trump’s policies on asylum seekers right now?This administration wants to see net zero refugee admissions, which we are getting close to. This is a core part of the agenda. It’s not just in disregard of international and domestic law, but it’s in disregard of the fact that so many of the asylum seekers who are being turned away are seeking protection from persecution. It’s an agenda that is blind to the experiences of these families. The inevitable result is that people will be sent to circumstances where they will likely die.What do you hope is the impact of your work and your findings?I used to believe in facts swaying public opinion. But I fear we are in a political moment where the ability to select which facts to consider true is making the work we do less important. Now it may be very difficult to move public opinion when opinions are formed on such a visceral level.But facts still matter. The truth still matters, because what is happening now is the administration is often acting first, and then the courts are litigating later. So even if the public is less and less swayed by the facts on the ground, judges still are.Were there moments in your career where you found academia unwelcoming?It can be strange having lived through something and then hearing about that subject through the perspective of somebody who studies the topic, but doesn’t have that personal connection. But I do quantitative work, and at the end of the day, the data speak much louder than my own personal background.What’s the hardest part of doing academic work that is relevant to urgent policy matters?A lot of academics are just scared about being wrong and being publicly wrong. But I believe in the importance of the work, and that means I need to be confident that I can stand by it. A few years ago I thought my bar was peer review in an academic journal. Now I understand my bar to be that as well as, “Can this pass muster with a federal judge or can this withstand a deposition from attorneys for the Department of Justice?”What effect does the work have on you personally?It’s often miserable. It’s difficult to hear. It’s difficult to interact with people, to see women and little kids who are the ages of my own children in shelters in Mexico, not knowing what’s going on. It is difficult to not internalize it. But I believe in the work. If it’s not me, I’m afraid there won’t be others who step up. Because it’ll be too easy for those others who want to step up to then step out after really understanding how difficult it is to have these conversations.How do you think we can get out of this crisis moment?We have to know our immigration policy past. Every generation gets to decide for itself, whether it embraces diversity through our immigration system or pushes it away by closing our golden door. We are defining for this generation how we are answering the question of what it means to be a nation of immigrants. And we have done that historically. And in some periods in our history, we have closed our doors to immigrants, and in other periods we have opened them again. This is cyclical. It is difficult to live through, but this has been a cyclical part of our immigration policy past.Every four years we as a country get to collectively answer whether or not we still believe in this idea that we are a nation of immigrants. In 2020, we will get to vote.",http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5mTp_BGJvUvwmexmBzFrEg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/9a0dd9c25d5ea0ca1353ff565b5c5106,He was undocumented.

I remember there were policy debates with the white kids on one side, the brown kids on the other, and me feeling like I had little understanding. But everything that was being said negatively toward my Latino classmates actually applied more directly to me.How did you overcome this and become an academic?I barely graduated high school after learning I was undocumented, because at the time I thought, what’s the point? But I got married when I was 19 and I was able to adjust my immigration status. I paid for a summer politics class, and I thought if this professor can make a living teaching, maybe I can do the same.It took me years to realize I bring a different perspective to the study of immigration, politics and policy, that my history is my comparative advantage. It’s a perspective that helps me ask questions that others don’t. It took me a while to talk about my experience of being undocumented, because my parents’ immigration status was still tenuous. But they’re fine now, and I’m able to speak out.What has been most shocking to you about your findings on what happens to asylum seekers?Some findings were simultaneously shocking, but also very expected since we’ve heard anecdotal reports. There were over 200 incidents of verbal abuse, dozens of instances of physical abuse and even property being taken away. I heard of someone losing their life savings.The findings about language access also really stuck out. Individuals are getting instructions about critically important steps in languages that they don’t speak: often Central American asylum speakers who speak an indigenous language by default are given instructions in Spanish. In San Diego, there are a lot of different languages – Asian Indians seeking asylum who speak Hindi were given instructions in English or Spanish. I find it hard to believe that we as a country can’t find a Hindi speaker. This is a basic due process tenet.What do we now know about the conditions people face when they are forced to return to Mexico?So many have experienced or been threatened with physical violence while waiting. Despite the handshake agreement between the United States and Mexico that Mexico is responsible for the humanitarian needs of these asylum seekers being returned, we are putting people in harm’s way by returning them to Mexico.What do you think is most important for the public to understand about the impact of Trump’s policies on asylum seekers right now?This administration wants to see net zero refugee admissions, which we are getting close to. This is a core part of the agenda. It’s not just in disregard of international and domestic law, but it’s in disregard of the fact that so many of the asylum seekers who are being turned away are seeking protection from persecution. It’s an agenda that is blind to the experiences of these families. The inevitable result is that people will be sent to circumstances where they will likely die.What do you hope is the impact of your work and your findings?I used to believe in facts swaying public opinion. But I fear we are in a political moment where the ability to select which facts to consider true is making the work we do less important. Now it may be very difficult to move public opinion when opinions are formed on such a visceral level.But facts still matter. The truth still matters, because what is happening now is the administration is often acting first, and then the courts are litigating later. So even if the public is less and less swayed by the facts on the ground, judges still are.Were there moments in your career where you found academia unwelcoming?It can be strange having lived through something and then hearing about that subject through the perspective of somebody who studies the topic, but doesn’t have that personal connection. But I do quantitative work, and at the end of the day, the data speak much louder than my own personal background.What’s the hardest part of doing academic work that is relevant to urgent policy matters?A lot of academics are just scared about being wrong and being publicly wrong. But I believe in the importance of the work, and that means I need to be confident that I can stand by it. A few years ago I thought my bar was peer review in an academic journal. Now I understand my bar to be that as well as, “Can this pass muster with a federal judge or can this withstand a deposition from attorneys for the Department of Justice?”What effect does the work have on you personally?It’s often miserable. It’s difficult to hear. It’s difficult to interact with people, to see women and little kids who are the ages of my own children in shelters in Mexico, not knowing what’s going on. It is difficult to not internalize it. But I believe in the work. If it’s not me, I’m afraid there won’t be others who step up. Because it’ll be too easy for those others who want to step up to then step out after really understanding how difficult it is to have these conversations.How do you think we can get out of this crisis moment?We have to know our immigration policy past. Every generation gets to decide for itself, whether it embraces diversity through our immigration system or pushes it away by closing our golden door. We are defining for this generation how we are answering the question of what it means to be a nation of immigrants. And we have done that historically. And in some periods in our history, we have closed our doors to immigrants, and in other periods we have opened them again. This is cyclical. It is difficult to live through, but this has been a cyclical part of our immigration policy past.Every four years we as a country get to collectively answer whether or not we still believe in this idea that we are a nation of immigrants. In 2020, we will get to vote.",http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5mTp_BGJvUvwmexmBzFrEg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/9a0dd9c25d5ea0ca1353ff565b5c5106,He was undocumented.

US helicopter raid reported in Syria after trove of Baghdadi intelligence taken,"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 14:29:53 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/us-helicopter-raid-reported-syria-135329505.html,"The US is believed to have carried out fresh raids on suspected senior Islamic State members in Syria overnight, as officials assessed a treasure trove of intelligence gathered from Isil leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s final hideout. Helicopters reported to be from the US-led coalition flew late on Monday night into al-Shuyukh village south of Jarablus, around three miles from a raid the previous day that killed Isil’s spokesman Abu Hassan al-Muhajir. Donald Trump, the US president, tweeted on Tuesday that Baghdadi's ""number one replacement"" had been killed. He did not name who that was, but it is thought he was referring to Muhajir. Analysts do not agree that Muhajir would have been Baghdadi's natural successor.  Just confirmed that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s number one replacement has been terminated by American troops. Most likely would have taken the top spot - Now he is also Dead!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2019 A spokesman for the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which is believed to have jointly conducted the mission, said there had been a “successful raid targeting and arresting senior Isil members” on Monday night without elaborating. Local sources reported that the mission lasted no more than 20 minutes and no clashes were heard. “An Iraqi family had moved there in recent times,” Aghiad al-Kheder, co-founder of anti-Isil activist group Sound and Picture, told the Telegraph. “We think two men were taken away by the helicopters.” The men’s identity, or relationship to Baghdadi, was not immediately known. “We think it's related to the Baghdadi raid,” said Mr Kheder, whose group has sources on the ground in the area. ”For sure US found important documents and maybe in the next few days we will see many operations like this.” Pentagon officials told the Washington Post that the documents and other information gathered during the raid on the compound in Barisha in Idlib province close to the Turkish border would prove useful in hunting down remaining senior Isil figures. The officials said two men were also captured alive in the raid who they hoped could provide intelligence about the group. Evidence was growing that Isil had an established smuggling ring, taking senior members from Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria and Qaim in western Iraqi to Idlib. The last moments of Islamic State leader Kurdish spies cultivated a source inside Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s inner circle who was able to steal the Islamic State leader’s underwear for DNA sampling and provide a detailed layout of his compound ahead of the US raid, the SDF commander said.  Mazloum Kobani Abdi, the head of the SDF, told NBC his intelligence officers had turned one of Baghdadi’s security advisors who was able to give critical information about the jihadist leader’s house and the tunnels beneath it.  The source took a pair of Baghdadi’s underwear and a blood sample to help US forces confirm who was hiding in the compound. The source was at the site on the night of the raid and was whisked out by US commandos. Polat Can, a senior adviser to the SDF, revealed more detailed information about the group's role in finding Baghdadi.  ""Since 15 May, we have been working together with the CIA,” said Polat Can, a senior adviser to the SDF. He said their surveillance tracked the 48-year-old reclusive leader moving to the village of Barisha in northern Idlib from northern Deir Ezzor in April. Iraqi officials confirmed to the Telegraph that they had arrested members of Baghdadi’s inner circle who were part of the ring and gave up the leader’s location. It is thought fighters with the Islamist group Hurras al-Din, an al-Qaeda-aligned group which is usually hostile to Isil, were also facilitating senior Isil leaders’ movement through rebel-held Idlib. Baghdadi was discovered at the house of one Hurras al-Din commander, Abu Mohamed al-Halabi, who was killed in the raid. Mustafa Bali, SDF’s spokesman, said that Muhajir, described as Baghdadi’s right-hand man, was believed to have been in the area in order to facilitate Baghdadi’s movements in Idlib and possibly on to Turkey. Muhajir was targeted in the village of Ain al-Baydah near Turkish-administered Jarablus with the help of SDF intelligence. Local sources said Muhajir had been travelling in a convoy made up of an oil tanker and a car. The SDF has questioned how Ankara was not aware of the presence of Baghdadi and other senior leaders so close to areas in Syria under its control.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/B6KeUW_UtUzwNngkCtKRHg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/71d3f202cf4591cbce4db9a6c924df4d,US helicopter raid reported in Syria after trove of Baghdadi intelligence taken

He was undocumented.

Photograph: Erik Jepsen/UC San Diego PublicationsTom K Wong’s world shattered at age 16 in 1998 when his parents told him he was undocumented. The Riverside, California, teenager thought his life was over.Now 37, Wong is one of the prominent scholars in the US on immigration, most recently uncovering abuses inside detention centers in his latest University of California, San Diego research. The political science professor, whose family migrated from Hong Kong when he was two and overstayed their visas, released groundbreaking research on Tuesday on asylum seekers, exposing violence and suffering at the border as the Trump administration is escalating its crackdown on migrants.Wong surveyed more than 600 asylum seekers affected by Donald Trump’s controversial “remain in Mexico” policy, which has forced tens of thousands to return to Mexico while their cases advance. Roughly, 85% reported that immigration detention facilities failed to provide adequate food and water and that they were unable to sleep due to overcrowding, cold temperatures and other conditions. Only 20% reported being able to take care of basic hygiene, such as showering and brushing their teeth.More than half said they faced verbal abuse inside detention, with some saying they also suffered physical abuse. Roughly 25% also had their property seized when taken into detention, including important documents and cash that was not returned to them, he said.A majority said they were forced to return to Mexico without any further investigation of the violence they might face there, which Wong said was a direct violation of the policy.While waiting in Mexico, one out of four said they were threatened with physical violence, and more said they ended up homeless.Asked about Wong’s research, a spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) said the agency “provides safe, humane, clean, professionally run and appropriate conditions of confinement” and access to legal and translation services. A spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection, which also detains migrants, said it “takes allegations of mistreatment of individuals in our facilities seriously” and that employees found to violate standards “will be held accountable”.Wong talked with the Guardian about his non-traditional academic career, the crisis at the border, and how he uses his PhD to fight back. The conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.Can you tell me what it was like to discover you were undocumented?My parents told me I couldn’t go with my high school basketball team to Canada. Then they told me I couldn’t get a driver’s license. I couldn’t get a job. And there was just a cascade of no, no, no. And finally my parents said it’s not because we don’t want you to do these things, it’s because you can’t. All my hopes and dreams about growing up were literally shattered in a single moment.

He said their surveillance tracked the 48-year-old reclusive leader moving to the village of Barisha in northern Idlib from northern Deir Ezzor in April. Iraqi officials confirmed to the Telegraph that they had arrested members of Baghdadi’s inner circle who were part of the ring and gave up the leader’s location. It is thought fighters with the Islamist group Hurras al-Din, an al-Qaeda-aligned group which is usually hostile to Isil, were also facilitating senior Isil leaders’ movement through rebel-held Idlib. Baghdadi was discovered at the house of one Hurras al-Din commander, Abu Mohamed al-Halabi, who was killed in the raid. Mustafa Bali, SDF’s spokesman, said that Muhajir, described as Baghdadi’s right-hand man, was believed to have been in the area in order to facilitate Baghdadi’s movements in Idlib and possibly on to Turkey. Muhajir was targeted in the village of Ain al-Baydah near Turkish-administered Jarablus with the help of SDF intelligence. Local sources said Muhajir had been travelling in a convoy made up of an oil tanker and a car. The SDF has questioned how Ankara was not aware of the presence of Baghdadi and other senior leaders so close to areas in Syria under its control.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/B6KeUW_UtUzwNngkCtKRHg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/71d3f202cf4591cbce4db9a6c924df4d,US helicopter raid reported in Syria after trove of Baghdadi intelligence taken

He was undocumented. Now he&#39;s exposing detention center abuse,"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 17:49:46 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/undocumented-now-hes-exposing-detention-100018960.html,"Tom Wong, a UC San Diego professor, has surveyed 600 asylum seekers and says the president’s policy is ‘sending people to die’Tom Wong, a UC San Diego professor, is uncovering the abuse immigrants face in overcrowded detention facilities. Photograph: Erik Jepsen/UC San Diego PublicationsTom K Wong’s world shattered at age 16 in 1998 when his parents told him he was undocumented. The Riverside, California, teenager thought his life was over.Now 37, Wong is one of the prominent scholars in the US on immigration, most recently uncovering abuses inside detention centers in his latest University of California, San Diego research. The political science professor, whose family migrated from Hong Kong when he was two and overstayed their visas, released groundbreaking research on Tuesday on asylum seekers, exposing violence and suffering at the border as the Trump administration is escalating its crackdown on migrants.Wong surveyed more than 600 asylum seekers affected by Donald Trump’s controversial “remain in Mexico” policy, which has forced tens of thousands to return to Mexico while their cases advance. Roughly, 85% reported that immigration detention facilities failed to provide adequate food and water and that they were unable to sleep due to overcrowding, cold temperatures and other conditions. Only 20% reported being able to take care of basic hygiene, such as showering and brushing their teeth.More than half said they faced verbal abuse inside detention, with some saying they also suffered physical abuse. Roughly 25% also had their property seized when taken into detention, including important documents and cash that was not returned to them, he said.A majority said they were forced to return to Mexico without any further investigation of the violence they might face there, which Wong said was a direct violation of the policy.While waiting in Mexico, one out of four said they were threatened with physical violence, and more said they ended up homeless.Asked about Wong’s research, a spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) said the agency “provides safe, humane, clean, professionally run and appropriate conditions of confinement” and access to legal and translation services. A spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection, which also detains migrants, said it “takes allegations of mistreatment of individuals in our facilities seriously” and that employees found to violate standards “will be held accountable”.Wong talked with the Guardian about his non-traditional academic career, the crisis at the border, and how he uses his PhD to fight back. The conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.Can you tell me what it was like to discover you were undocumented?My parents told me I couldn’t go with my high school basketball team to Canada. Then they told me I couldn’t get a driver’s license. I couldn’t get a job. And there was just a cascade of no, no, no. And finally my parents said it’s not because we don’t want you to do these things, it’s because you can’t. All my hopes and dreams about growing up were literally shattered in a single moment. And it was during a time when there wasn’t the undocumented youth movement, so I wasn’t able to find other students.I grew up in a predominantly Latino neighborhood, and before I found out I was undocumented, California was becoming a ground zero for this emerging anti-immigrant movement. I remember there were policy debates with the white kids on one side, the brown kids on the other, and me feeling like I had little understanding. But everything that was being said negatively toward my Latino classmates actually applied more directly to me.How did you overcome this and become an academic?I barely graduated high school after learning I was undocumented, because at the time I thought, what’s the point? But I got married when I was 19 and I was able to adjust my immigration status. I paid for a summer politics class, and I thought if this professor can make a living teaching, maybe I can do the same.It took me years to realize I bring a different perspective to the study of immigration, politics and policy, that my history is my comparative advantage. It’s a perspective that helps me ask questions that others don’t. It took me a while to talk about my experience of being undocumented, because my parents’ immigration status was still tenuous. But they’re fine now, and I’m able to speak out.What has been most shocking to you about your findings on what happens to asylum seekers?Some findings were simultaneously shocking, but also very expected since we’ve heard anecdotal reports. There were over 200 incidents of verbal abuse, dozens of instances of physical abuse and even property being taken away. I heard of someone losing their life savings.The findings about language access also really stuck out. Individuals are getting instructions about critically important steps in languages that they don’t speak: often Central American asylum speakers who speak an indigenous language by default are given instructions in Spanish. In San Diego, there are a lot of different languages – Asian Indians seeking asylum who speak Hindi were given instructions in English or Spanish. I find it hard to believe that we as a country can’t find a Hindi speaker. This is a basic due process tenet.What do we now know about the conditions people face when they are forced to return to Mexico?So many have experienced or been threatened with physical violence while waiting. Despite the handshake agreement between the United States and Mexico that Mexico is responsible for the humanitarian needs of these asylum seekers being returned, we are putting people in harm’s way by returning them to Mexico.What do you think is most important for the public to understand about the impact of Trump’s policies on asylum seekers right now?This administration wants to see net zero refugee admissions, which we are getting close to. This is a core part of the agenda. It’s not just in disregard of international and domestic law, but it’s in disregard of the fact that so many of the asylum seekers who are being turned away are seeking protection from persecution. It’s an agenda that is blind to the experiences of these families. The inevitable result is that people will be sent to circumstances where they will likely die.What do you hope is the impact of your work and your findings?I used to believe in facts swaying public opinion. But I fear we are in a political moment where the ability to select which facts to consider true is making the work we do less important. Now it may be very difficult to move public opinion when opinions are formed on such a visceral level.But facts still matter. The truth still matters, because what is happening now is the administration is often acting first, and then the courts are litigating later. So even if the public is less and less swayed by the facts on the ground, judges still are.Were there moments in your career where you found academia unwelcoming?It can be strange having lived through something and then hearing about that subject through the perspective of somebody who studies the topic, but doesn’t have that personal connection. But I do quantitative work, and at the end of the day, the data speak much louder than my own personal background.What’s the hardest part of doing academic work that is relevant to urgent policy matters?A lot of academics are just scared about being wrong and being publicly wrong. But I believe in the importance of the work, and that means I need to be confident that I can stand by it. A few years ago I thought my bar was peer review in an academic journal. Now I understand my bar to be that as well as, “Can this pass muster with a federal judge or can this withstand a deposition from attorneys for the Department of Justice?”What effect does the work have on you personally?It’s often miserable. It’s difficult to hear. It’s difficult to interact with people, to see women and little kids who are the ages of my own children in shelters in Mexico, not knowing what’s going on. It is difficult to not internalize it. But I believe in the work. If it’s not me, I’m afraid there won’t be others who step up. Because it’ll be too easy for those others who want to step up to then step out after really understanding how difficult it is to have these conversations.How do you think we can get out of this crisis moment?We have to know our immigration policy past. Every generation gets to decide for itself, whether it embraces diversity through our immigration system or pushes it away by closing our golden door. We are defining for this generation how we are answering the question of what it means to be a nation of immigrants. And we have done that historically. And in some periods in our history, we have closed our doors to immigrants, and in other periods we have opened them again. This is cyclical. It is difficult to live through, but this has been a cyclical part of our immigration policy past.Every four years we as a country get to collectively answer whether or not we still believe in this idea that we are a nation of immigrants. In 2020, we will get to vote.",http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5mTp_BGJvUvwmexmBzFrEg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/9a0dd9c25d5ea0ca1353ff565b5c5106,He was undocumented.

US helicopter raid reported in Syria after trove of Baghdadi intelligence taken,"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 14:29:53 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/us-helicopter-raid-reported-syria-135329505.html,"The US is believed to have carried out fresh raids on suspected senior Islamic State members in Syria overnight, as officials assessed a treasure trove of intelligence gathered from Isil leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s final hideout. Helicopters reported to be from the US-led coalition flew late on Monday night into al-Shuyukh village south of Jarablus, around three miles from a raid the previous day that killed Isil’s spokesman Abu Hassan al-Muhajir. Donald Trump, the US president, tweeted on Tuesday that Baghdadi's ""number one replacement"" had been killed. He did not name who that was, but it is thought he was referring to Muhajir. Analysts do not agree that Muhajir would have been Baghdadi's natural successor.  Just confirmed that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s number one replacement has been terminated by American troops. Most likely would have taken the top spot - Now he is also Dead!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2019 A spokesman for the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which is believed to have jointly conducted the mission, said there had been a “successful raid targeting and arresting senior Isil members” on Monday night without elaborating. Local sources reported that the mission lasted no more than 20 minutes and no clashes were heard. “An Iraqi family had moved there in recent times,” Aghiad al-Kheder, co-founder of anti-Isil activist group Sound and Picture, told the Telegraph. “We think two men were taken away by the helicopters.” The men’s identity, or relationship to Baghdadi, was not immediately known. “We think it's related to the Baghdadi raid,” said Mr Kheder, whose group has sources on the ground in the area. ”For sure US found important documents and maybe in the next few days we will see many operations like this.” Pentagon officials told the Washington Post that the documents and other information gathered during the raid on the compound in Barisha in Idlib province close to the Turkish border would prove useful in hunting down remaining senior Isil figures. The officials said two men were also captured alive in the raid who they hoped could provide intelligence about the group. Evidence was growing that Isil had an established smuggling ring, taking senior members from Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria and Qaim in western Iraqi to Idlib. The last moments of Islamic State leader Kurdish spies cultivated a source inside Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s inner circle who was able to steal the Islamic State leader’s underwear for DNA sampling and provide a detailed layout of his compound ahead of the US raid, the SDF commander said.  Mazloum Kobani Abdi, the head of the SDF, told NBC his intelligence officers had turned one of Baghdadi’s security advisors who was able to give critical information about the jihadist leader’s house and the tunnels beneath it.  The source took a pair of Baghdadi’s underwear and a blood sample to help US forces confirm who was hiding in the compound. The source was at the site on the night of the raid and was whisked out by US commandos. Polat Can, a senior adviser to the SDF, revealed more detailed information about the group's role in finding Baghdadi.  ""Since 15 May, we have been working together with the CIA,” said Polat Can, a senior adviser to the SDF.

The inevitable result is that people will be sent to circumstances where they will likely die.What do you hope is the impact of your work and your findings?I used to believe in facts swaying public opinion. But I fear we are in a political moment where the ability to select which facts to consider true is making the work we do less important. Now it may be very difficult to move public opinion when opinions are formed on such a visceral level.But facts still matter. The truth still matters, because what is happening now is the administration is often acting first, and then the courts are litigating later. So even if the public is less and less swayed by the facts on the ground, judges still are.Were there moments in your career where you found academia unwelcoming?It can be strange having lived through something and then hearing about that subject through the perspective of somebody who studies the topic, but doesn’t have that personal connection. But I do quantitative work, and at the end of the day, the data speak much louder than my own personal background.What’s the hardest part of doing academic work that is relevant to urgent policy matters?A lot of academics are just scared about being wrong and being publicly wrong. But I believe in the importance of the work, and that means I need to be confident that I can stand by it. A few years ago I thought my bar was peer review in an academic journal. Now I understand my bar to be that as well as, “Can this pass muster with a federal judge or can this withstand a deposition from attorneys for the Department of Justice?”What effect does the work have on you personally?It’s often miserable. It’s difficult to hear. It’s difficult to interact with people, to see women and little kids who are the ages of my own children in shelters in Mexico, not knowing what’s going on. It is difficult to not internalize it. But I believe in the work. If it’s not me, I’m afraid there won’t be others who step up. Because it’ll be too easy for those others who want to step up to then step out after really understanding how difficult it is to have these conversations.How do you think we can get out of this crisis moment?We have to know our immigration policy past. Every generation gets to decide for itself, whether it embraces diversity through our immigration system or pushes it away by closing our golden door. We are defining for this generation how we are answering the question of what it means to be a nation of immigrants. And we have done that historically. And in some periods in our history, we have closed our doors to immigrants, and in other periods we have opened them again. This is cyclical. It is difficult to live through, but this has been a cyclical part of our immigration policy past.Every four years we as a country get to collectively answer whether or not we still believe in this idea that we are a nation of immigrants.

US helicopter raid reported in Syria after trove of Baghdadi intelligence taken,"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 14:29:53 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/us-helicopter-raid-reported-syria-135329505.html,"The US is believed to have carried out fresh raids on suspected senior Islamic State members in Syria overnight, as officials assessed a treasure trove of intelligence gathered from Isil leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s final hideout. Helicopters reported to be from the US-led coalition flew late on Monday night into al-Shuyukh village south of Jarablus, around three miles from a raid the previous day that killed Isil’s spokesman Abu Hassan al-Muhajir. Donald Trump, the US president, tweeted on Tuesday that Baghdadi's ""number one replacement"" had been killed. He did not name who that was, but it is thought he was referring to Muhajir. Analysts do not agree that Muhajir would have been Baghdadi's natural successor.  Just confirmed that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s number one replacement has been terminated by American troops. Most likely would have taken the top spot - Now he is also Dead!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2019 A spokesman for the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which is believed to have jointly conducted the mission, said there had been a “successful raid targeting and arresting senior Isil members” on Monday night without elaborating. Local sources reported that the mission lasted no more than 20 minutes and no clashes were heard. “An Iraqi family had moved there in recent times,” Aghiad al-Kheder, co-founder of anti-Isil activist group Sound and Picture, told the Telegraph. “We think two men were taken away by the helicopters.” The men’s identity, or relationship to Baghdadi, was not immediately known. “We think it's related to the Baghdadi raid,” said Mr Kheder, whose group has sources on the ground in the area. ”For sure US found important documents and maybe in the next few days we will see many operations like this.” Pentagon officials told the Washington Post that the documents and other information gathered during the raid on the compound in Barisha in Idlib province close to the Turkish border would prove useful in hunting down remaining senior Isil figures. The officials said two men were also captured alive in the raid who they hoped could provide intelligence about the group. Evidence was growing that Isil had an established smuggling ring, taking senior members from Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria and Qaim in western Iraqi to Idlib. The last moments of Islamic State leader Kurdish spies cultivated a source inside Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s inner circle who was able to steal the Islamic State leader’s underwear for DNA sampling and provide a detailed layout of his compound ahead of the US raid, the SDF commander said.  Mazloum Kobani Abdi, the head of the SDF, told NBC his intelligence officers had turned one of Baghdadi’s security advisors who was able to give critical information about the jihadist leader’s house and the tunnels beneath it.  The source took a pair of Baghdadi’s underwear and a blood sample to help US forces confirm who was hiding in the compound. The source was at the site on the night of the raid and was whisked out by US commandos. Polat Can, a senior adviser to the SDF, revealed more detailed information about the group's role in finding Baghdadi.  ""Since 15 May, we have been working together with the CIA,” said Polat Can, a senior adviser to the SDF. He said their surveillance tracked the 48-year-old reclusive leader moving to the village of Barisha in northern Idlib from northern Deir Ezzor in April. Iraqi officials confirmed to the Telegraph that they had arrested members of Baghdadi’s inner circle who were part of the ring and gave up the leader’s location. It is thought fighters with the Islamist group Hurras al-Din, an al-Qaeda-aligned group which is usually hostile to Isil, were also facilitating senior Isil leaders’ movement through rebel-held Idlib. Baghdadi was discovered at the house of one Hurras al-Din commander, Abu Mohamed al-Halabi, who was killed in the raid. Mustafa Bali, SDF’s spokesman, said that Muhajir, described as Baghdadi’s right-hand man, was believed to have been in the area in order to facilitate Baghdadi’s movements in Idlib and possibly on to Turkey. Muhajir was targeted in the village of Ain al-Baydah near Turkish-administered Jarablus with the help of SDF intelligence. Local sources said Muhajir had been travelling in a convoy made up of an oil tanker and a car. The SDF has questioned how Ankara was not aware of the presence of Baghdadi and other senior leaders so close to areas in Syria under its control.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/B6KeUW_UtUzwNngkCtKRHg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/71d3f202cf4591cbce4db9a6c924df4d,US helicopter raid reported in Syria after trove of Baghdadi intelligence taken

He was undocumented.

Photograph: Erik Jepsen/UC San Diego PublicationsTom K Wong’s world shattered at age 16 in 1998 when his parents told him he was undocumented. The Riverside, California, teenager thought his life was over.Now 37, Wong is one of the prominent scholars in the US on immigration, most recently uncovering abuses inside detention centers in his latest University of California, San Diego research. The political science professor, whose family migrated from Hong Kong when he was two and overstayed their visas, released groundbreaking research on Tuesday on asylum seekers, exposing violence and suffering at the border as the Trump administration is escalating its crackdown on migrants.Wong surveyed more than 600 asylum seekers affected by Donald Trump’s controversial “remain in Mexico” policy, which has forced tens of thousands to return to Mexico while their cases advance. Roughly, 85% reported that immigration detention facilities failed to provide adequate food and water and that they were unable to sleep due to overcrowding, cold temperatures and other conditions. Only 20% reported being able to take care of basic hygiene, such as showering and brushing their teeth.More than half said they faced verbal abuse inside detention, with some saying they also suffered physical abuse. Roughly 25% also had their property seized when taken into detention, including important documents and cash that was not returned to them, he said.A majority said they were forced to return to Mexico without any further investigation of the violence they might face there, which Wong said was a direct violation of the policy.While waiting in Mexico, one out of four said they were threatened with physical violence, and more said they ended up homeless.Asked about Wong’s research, a spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) said the agency “provides safe, humane, clean, professionally run and appropriate conditions of confinement” and access to legal and translation services. A spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection, which also detains migrants, said it “takes allegations of mistreatment of individuals in our facilities seriously” and that employees found to violate standards “will be held accountable”.Wong talked with the Guardian about his non-traditional academic career, the crisis at the border, and how he uses his PhD to fight back. The conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.Can you tell me what it was like to discover you were undocumented?My parents told me I couldn’t go with my high school basketball team to Canada. Then they told me I couldn’t get a driver’s license. I couldn’t get a job. And there was just a cascade of no, no, no. And finally my parents said it’s not because we don’t want you to do these things, it’s because you can’t. All my hopes and dreams about growing up were literally shattered in a single moment. And it was during a time when there wasn’t the undocumented youth movement, so I wasn’t able to find other students.I grew up in a predominantly Latino neighborhood, and before I found out I was undocumented, California was becoming a ground zero for this emerging anti-immigrant movement. I remember there were policy debates with the white kids on one side, the brown kids on the other, and me feeling like I had little understanding. But everything that was being said negatively toward my Latino classmates actually applied more directly to me.How did you overcome this and become an academic?I barely graduated high school after learning I was undocumented, because at the time I thought, what’s the point? But I got married when I was 19 and I was able to adjust my immigration status. I paid for a summer politics class, and I thought if this professor can make a living teaching, maybe I can do the same.It took me years to realize I bring a different perspective to the study of immigration, politics and policy, that my history is my comparative advantage. It’s a perspective that helps me ask questions that others don’t. It took me a while to talk about my experience of being undocumented, because my parents’ immigration status was still tenuous. But they’re fine now, and I’m able to speak out.What has been most shocking to you about your findings on what happens to asylum seekers?Some findings were simultaneously shocking, but also very expected since we’ve heard anecdotal reports. There were over 200 incidents of verbal abuse, dozens of instances of physical abuse and even property being taken away. I heard of someone losing their life savings.The findings about language access also really stuck out. Individuals are getting instructions about critically important steps in languages that they don’t speak: often Central American asylum speakers who speak an indigenous language by default are given instructions in Spanish. In San Diego, there are a lot of different languages – Asian Indians seeking asylum who speak Hindi were given instructions in English or Spanish. I find it hard to believe that we as a country can’t find a Hindi speaker. This is a basic due process tenet.What do we now know about the conditions people face when they are forced to return to Mexico?So many have experienced or been threatened with physical violence while waiting. Despite the handshake agreement between the United States and Mexico that Mexico is responsible for the humanitarian needs of these asylum seekers being returned, we are putting people in harm’s way by returning them to Mexico.What do you think is most important for the public to understand about the impact of Trump’s policies on asylum seekers right now?This administration wants to see net zero refugee admissions, which we are getting close to. This is a core part of the agenda. It’s not just in disregard of international and domestic law, but it’s in disregard of the fact that so many of the asylum seekers who are being turned away are seeking protection from persecution. It’s an agenda that is blind to the experiences of these families. The inevitable result is that people will be sent to circumstances where they will likely die.What do you hope is the impact of your work and your findings?I used to believe in facts swaying public opinion.

He was undocumented. Now he&#39;s exposing detention center abuse,"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 17:49:46 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/undocumented-now-hes-exposing-detention-100018960.html,"Tom Wong, a UC San Diego professor, has surveyed 600 asylum seekers and says the president’s policy is ‘sending people to die’Tom Wong, a UC San Diego professor, is uncovering the abuse immigrants face in overcrowded detention facilities. Photograph: Erik Jepsen/UC San Diego PublicationsTom K Wong’s world shattered at age 16 in 1998 when his parents told him he was undocumented. The Riverside, California, teenager thought his life was over.Now 37, Wong is one of the prominent scholars in the US on immigration, most recently uncovering abuses inside detention centers in his latest University of California, San Diego research. The political science professor, whose family migrated from Hong Kong when he was two and overstayed their visas, released groundbreaking research on Tuesday on asylum seekers, exposing violence and suffering at the border as the Trump administration is escalating its crackdown on migrants.Wong surveyed more than 600 asylum seekers affected by Donald Trump’s controversial “remain in Mexico” policy, which has forced tens of thousands to return to Mexico while their cases advance. Roughly, 85% reported that immigration detention facilities failed to provide adequate food and water and that they were unable to sleep due to overcrowding, cold temperatures and other conditions. Only 20% reported being able to take care of basic hygiene, such as showering and brushing their teeth.More than half said they faced verbal abuse inside detention, with some saying they also suffered physical abuse. Roughly 25% also had their property seized when taken into detention, including important documents and cash that was not returned to them, he said.A majority said they were forced to return to Mexico without any further investigation of the violence they might face there, which Wong said was a direct violation of the policy.While waiting in Mexico, one out of four said they were threatened with physical violence, and more said they ended up homeless.Asked about Wong’s research, a spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) said the agency “provides safe, humane, clean, professionally run and appropriate conditions of confinement” and access to legal and translation services. A spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection, which also detains migrants, said it “takes allegations of mistreatment of individuals in our facilities seriously” and that employees found to violate standards “will be held accountable”.Wong talked with the Guardian about his non-traditional academic career, the crisis at the border, and how he uses his PhD to fight back. The conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.Can you tell me what it was like to discover you were undocumented?My parents told me I couldn’t go with my high school basketball team to Canada. Then they told me I couldn’t get a driver’s license. I couldn’t get a job. And there was just a cascade of no, no, no. And finally my parents said it’s not because we don’t want you to do these things, it’s because you can’t. All my hopes and dreams about growing up were literally shattered in a single moment. And it was during a time when there wasn’t the undocumented youth movement, so I wasn’t able to find other students.I grew up in a predominantly Latino neighborhood, and before I found out I was undocumented, California was becoming a ground zero for this emerging anti-immigrant movement. I remember there were policy debates with the white kids on one side, the brown kids on the other, and me feeling like I had little understanding. But everything that was being said negatively toward my Latino classmates actually applied more directly to me.How did you overcome this and become an academic?I barely graduated high school after learning I was undocumented, because at the time I thought, what’s the point? But I got married when I was 19 and I was able to adjust my immigration status. I paid for a summer politics class, and I thought if this professor can make a living teaching, maybe I can do the same.It took me years to realize I bring a different perspective to the study of immigration, politics and policy, that my history is my comparative advantage. It’s a perspective that helps me ask questions that others don’t. It took me a while to talk about my experience of being undocumented, because my parents’ immigration status was still tenuous. But they’re fine now, and I’m able to speak out.What has been most shocking to you about your findings on what happens to asylum seekers?Some findings were simultaneously shocking, but also very expected since we’ve heard anecdotal reports. There were over 200 incidents of verbal abuse, dozens of instances of physical abuse and even property being taken away. I heard of someone losing their life savings.The findings about language access also really stuck out. Individuals are getting instructions about critically important steps in languages that they don’t speak: often Central American asylum speakers who speak an indigenous language by default are given instructions in Spanish. In San Diego, there are a lot of different languages – Asian Indians seeking asylum who speak Hindi were given instructions in English or Spanish. I find it hard to believe that we as a country can’t find a Hindi speaker. This is a basic due process tenet.What do we now know about the conditions people face when they are forced to return to Mexico?So many have experienced or been threatened with physical violence while waiting. Despite the handshake agreement between the United States and Mexico that Mexico is responsible for the humanitarian needs of these asylum seekers being returned, we are putting people in harm’s way by returning them to Mexico.What do you think is most important for the public to understand about the impact of Trump’s policies on asylum seekers right now?This administration wants to see net zero refugee admissions, which we are getting close to. This is a core part of the agenda. It’s not just in disregard of international and domestic law, but it’s in disregard of the fact that so many of the asylum seekers who are being turned away are seeking protection from persecution. It’s an agenda that is blind to the experiences of these families. The inevitable result is that people will be sent to circumstances where they will likely die.What do you hope is the impact of your work and your findings?I used to believe in facts swaying public opinion. But I fear we are in a political moment where the ability to select which facts to consider true is making the work we do less important. Now it may be very difficult to move public opinion when opinions are formed on such a visceral level.But facts still matter. The truth still matters, because what is happening now is the administration is often acting first, and then the courts are litigating later. So even if the public is less and less swayed by the facts on the ground, judges still are.Were there moments in your career where you found academia unwelcoming?It can be strange having lived through something and then hearing about that subject through the perspective of somebody who studies the topic, but doesn’t have that personal connection. But I do quantitative work, and at the end of the day, the data speak much louder than my own personal background.What’s the hardest part of doing academic work that is relevant to urgent policy matters?A lot of academics are just scared about being wrong and being publicly wrong. But I believe in the importance of the work, and that means I need to be confident that I can stand by it. A few years ago I thought my bar was peer review in an academic journal. Now I understand my bar to be that as well as, “Can this pass muster with a federal judge or can this withstand a deposition from attorneys for the Department of Justice?”What effect does the work have on you personally?It’s often miserable. It’s difficult to hear. It’s difficult to interact with people, to see women and little kids who are the ages of my own children in shelters in Mexico, not knowing what’s going on. It is difficult to not internalize it. But I believe in the work. If it’s not me, I’m afraid there won’t be others who step up. Because it’ll be too easy for those others who want to step up to then step out after really understanding how difficult it is to have these conversations.How do you think we can get out of this crisis moment?We have to know our immigration policy past. Every generation gets to decide for itself, whether it embraces diversity through our immigration system or pushes it away by closing our golden door. We are defining for this generation how we are answering the question of what it means to be a nation of immigrants. And we have done that historically. And in some periods in our history, we have closed our doors to immigrants, and in other periods we have opened them again. This is cyclical. It is difficult to live through, but this has been a cyclical part of our immigration policy past.Every four years we as a country get to collectively answer whether or not we still believe in this idea that we are a nation of immigrants. In 2020, we will get to vote.",http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5mTp_BGJvUvwmexmBzFrEg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/9a0dd9c25d5ea0ca1353ff565b5c5106,He was undocumented.
