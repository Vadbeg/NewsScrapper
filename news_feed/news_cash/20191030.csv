"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:17:36 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/record-wave-lone-child-migrants-122133758.html,"TENOSIQUE, Mexico -- The United States has detained more children trying to cross the nation's southwest border on their own over the last year than during any other period on record, surpassing the surge of unaccompanied minors that set off a crisis during the Obama administration, according to new figures released Tuesday.U.S. immigration authorities apprehended 76,020 minors, most of them from Central America, traveling without their parents in the fiscal year that ended in September -- 52% more than during the last fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Mexico is experiencing the same surge. Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period -- pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.In interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous -- and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.""These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,"" Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters. ""And each month during the fiscal year, the numbers increased. You saw them. We all saw them.""The young migrants came alongside a historic wave of families traveling together, also largely from Central America. They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.Marvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced -- and he pressed on.""Quitting was not an option,"" Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. ""You wipe your tears and carry on.""For the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they'd kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.His parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said. ""We can't bear losing another son,"" they told him. ""You have to go.""He left home in the spring, with $40 in his pocket and no plan except to find work in a safer place.As for most underage migrants traveling without their parents, his trip north has been a feat of improvisation and courage. He walked and hitchhiked through Honduras and Guatemala. He slept in churches, under trees or wherever he found himself when night fell.Along the way, he gathered crucial bits of information from fellow migrants: the best route to take, locations of shelters up ahead, places to avoid, where to forage for food.As huge numbers of young migrants from Central America began arriving at the United States' southern border in 2014, the Obama administration scrambled to house them until they could be released to sponsors -- adults who applied to care for them. The shelter system grew dramatically as a result.The Trump administration experienced similar backups at the border just a few years later -- this time because of new, more stringent policies that made the sponsors themselves, who are often undocumented, vulnerable to immigration authorities. This discouraged people from coming forward, leaving thousands of children to languish in the system.The Trump administration has also sought to deter migration by separating thousands of children from their relatives, again driving up the number of children in federally contracted shelters.On the road, while trying to avoid detention, fear and hunger are constant companions for many young migrants.With little or no money in their pockets, they relied on strangers for snacks or meals. They pawed through garbage and scanned drifts of debris on the roadside, hoping to spot an edible morsel.Wilson, a 17-year-old Honduran, said he had feasted on rotten mangos discarded by street vendors.""I used to drink water from potholes when I was too thirsty,"" interjected Mario Leonel, 16, who left home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, several weeks ago without notifying his parents. ""That is the hardest part of it all: the hunger.""When he arrived at the shelter in Tenosique, a small Mexican town near the Guatemala border, he called his parents in Honduras, who burst into tears and pleaded for him to return. He said no. He was tired of all the violence in his country, and wanted to get asylum in the United States.After Marvel slipped across the Guatemala-Mexico border in May, he found room at a shelter in Tenosique, which serves as a transit point for many migrants. He quickly made new friends among other teenage migrants who had made it this far, mainly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador.On a recent afternoon, several of them gathered in a two-story building that had been reserved for minors, its walls painted with colorful animal murals. The boys cracked jokes, roughhoused and argued about who was the cutest girl in the shelter.Outside, Dulce, a 16-year-old transgender migrant from Guatemala, sat alone on train tracks pining for a boy she had met at the shelter. He had left without explanation and she was lovesick.""I just can't get him out of my mind,"" she said.She left her hometown four months earlier to escape abuse from her family and strangers, including a sexual assault by gang members when she was 12. She made it as far as central Mexico before being detained and deported. Five days after returning home, she set off again.""I left because I had nothing there and no one to protect me,"" she said. ""At least here I am safe.""Though the United States remains the destination of choice for most unaccompanied minors, an increasing number are setting their sights no farther than Mexico, advocates and migrants say.Sometimes they have no choice: Mexico's increased enforcement measures have made it more difficult for migrants to make it to the border with the United States. And even if they reach the United States, recent policies have drastically lowered the possibilities of getting asylum.In Mexico, when unaccompanied minors are detained, the law mandates that they be released right away into the custody of the national child protection agency, which finds them accommodation in shelters designed for children.But migrants' advocates say the government has been holding children in the nation's overcrowded detention centers for far too long, and that some children are quickly funneled into the deportation process rather than being given a fair chance to seek asylum or some other form of relief.""No child should ever be held at a detention center,"" said Elba Coria, a migration expert from the Clinic for Refugees at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City. ""But while international standards consider children's detention as an exceptional measure, amid Mexico's migration chaos, it is the rule.""Neither Marvel nor any of his new friends in the Tenosique shelter had been detained by the authorities. All had managed to cross into Mexico from Guatemala and had applied for asylum in Mexico after talking through their options with the shelter staff.They now plan to remain in Mexico and look for work and study opportunities -- even if they haven't abandoned hope of making it to the United States.""It is every Honduran's boy dream to get to the United States, where there is more money and kids are able to go to school,"" said Jose Angel, 17. He was born with a disability that left him unable to use his arms and left his hometown because his grandmother could no longer take care of him.He was hopeful he could apply for asylum in the United States despite Trump's many efforts to severely lower the number of people granted asylum. ""It is scary, but you have to take a chance,"" he said.On a recent morning, Alan, a 17-year-old Guatemalan migrant, sat on the sidewalk outside a migrant shelter in the city of Palenque, in southern Mexico. He had just crossed the border and was exhausted. Mexican immigration officials had stopped a bus he was on, but he managed to escape into the countryside and hide.Alan planned to take a nap, shower and have a meal before trying illegally to board a freight train known as The Beast. It runs from Mexico's border with Guatemala to its border with the United States and, for decades, migrants have clung to it to speed through much of Mexico.His hope was to make it to the U.S. border and petition for asylum. He was undeterred by Trump's recent efforts to restrict asylum claims or curb immigration.""One way or another, I have to make it to the other side where there are skyscrapers and life is better,"" he said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5ol82jExNHqBHa7IGzz2mw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/03f35d3f9d537a8dc9fe503d06c098de,"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation"
Meghan McCain Spars With Cory Booker Over Civility: Beto Was ‘Very Nasty’ to Me!,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:39:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/meghan-mccain-spars-cory-booker-163901660.html,"During a Wednesday interview with Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, The View’s Meghan McCain did what she apparently does best: Make the conversation about herself and, in this case, her personal beef with a presidential hopeful.After applauding Booker for saying Medicare for All is unrealistic, the conservative View co-host took issue with the New Jersey senator’s support for mandatory gun buybacks. This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he’s going to take her brother’s guns.After a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they’d continue the conversation in the next segment.“No we’re not,” McCain grumbled. “It’s fine.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Tucker Carlson and Guest Blame Diversity and ‘Woke’ Culture for California Fires,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 07:17:19 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/tucker-carlson-guest-blame-diversity-032855316.html,"Fox NewsFox News host Tucker Carlson and his guest, conservative YouTube personality Dave Rubin, both insisted Tuesday night that the wildfires burning across California are due largely to progressive ideology, “woke” culture, and diversity in hiring.During Tuesday’s broadcast of Tucker Carlson Tonight, Carlson welcomed on Rubin, a political commentator and podcaster, to discuss the issues surrounding the large fires engulfing the state, including those related to the electrical grid and firefighting methods.“PG&E; strikes me as almost a metaphor for the destruction of the state,” Carlson said about the state’s power company. “Here’s the utility which doesn’t really know anything about its own infrastructure but knows everything about the race of its employees. How did we get there?”After noting that he lives near one of the fires in the Los Angeles area, Rubin immediately took aim at liberal politics as the main reason the wildfires have grown so large and dangerous.“The problem right now is that everything, EVERYTHING, from academia to public utilities to politics, everything that goes woke, that buys into this ridiculous progressive ideology that cares about what contractors are LGBT or how many black firemen we have or white this or Asian that, everything that goes that road eventually breaks down,” he declared.As Carlson nodded and said “that’s true,” Rubin continued, complaining that this isn’t how “freedom is supposed to operate.”“What is supposed to happen—imagine if your house was on fire,” he added. “Would you care what the public utility or what the fire company, what contractor they brought in, what gender or sexuality or any of those things he or she was? It’s just absolutely ridiculous.”The Fox News host continued to agree with Rubin, who went on to tie PG&E;’s preemptive blackouts to a lack of “libertarian or conservative-minded people in California to fight what the progressives are doing to the state.”“If you can’t keep the lights on and you can’t keep the place from burning down, you’ve reached the point where there is no kind of lying about it anymore,” Carlson concluded. “It’s falling apart.

Al Gore Is Opening a New Front In the War On Climate Change,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 04:00:02 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/al-gore-makes-climate-case-080002432.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Al Gore’s 400-acre farm is located in Carthage, a small Tennessee town where the former vice president and senator traditionally kicked off his political campaigns. During his second act as a famous environmentalist, the farm became the site of a training program for aspiring climate activists, and more recently, an experiment in what Gore said is the world’s most realistic chance at averting climate catastrophe.Topsoil, the foot or so of ground underneath your feet, is responsible for almost all food production on Earth. It also stores more than three times as much carbon as forests. Today, agriculture is a net carbon emitter, contributing about 14% of all greenhouse gas emissions, but unlike power generation or automobiles, it can be turned into a net absorber, pulling carbon out of the atmosphere.If farming practices are changed through the use of cover crops, low-tilling and tree-planting, Gore said, agriculture conglomerates and family farmers alike could theoretically make their farms more productive while fighting global warming. Those changes can also replenish nutrients to the world’s soil, of which 33% has already been depleted.A virtuous circle if there ever was one—and one that’s already attracting attention from farmers, consumers and food companies.Gore, 71, is preaching the benefits of so-called carbon farming, a form of regenerative farming, at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump has been trying to roll back regulations meant to limit greenhouse gas emissions. And while science-based climate policy has been a prominent topic on the Democratic presidential campaign trail, it’s not always seen as a priority.Gore, who these days is more of a denim-wearing advocate than reserved technocrat, remains undeterred. His laboratory has been the farm where his parents once raised livestock and grew tobacco. Earlier this month, he invited 450 soil experts—farmers, scientists, chefs, food experts, entrepreneurs and investors—to join him there to discuss how to scale regenerative farming into something that might actually slow climate change.“We’ve waited so long to start to address the climate crisis,” Gore told those gathered. “We will need to both reduce emissions drastically and take as much carbon out of the atmosphere as we possibly can.”Unlike 2006, when Gore’s film “An Inconvenient Truth” was met with skepticism in some quarters, 13 years of intensifying storms, catastrophic floods and unprecedented droughts and wildfires have persuaded more Americans that there’s a very big problem. The goal now, Gore said, is to get people to start taking carbon farming seriously.When it comes to actually tackling what may soon become an existential crisis, the numbers are daunting. Trillions of dollars are needed to adapt civilization to the near-term consequences of climate change while tens of trillions of dollars are needed to slow its advance. But Gore said there are still too few plans to reverse global warming that don’t rely on technology that has yet to be developed.“Planting trees and sequestering carbon in soil are likely to remain the two most effective approaches,” Gore said in an interview at his Carthage farm. “There’s already some indication that farms that operate this way are more resilient in the face of climate extremes.”Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are at their highest in 3 million years. Oceans, the biggest carbon sinks of all, are acidifying because they hold too much of it. Plant life, which absorbs CO2 through photosynthesis, can sink carbon into the soil. Regenerative farming helps speed that along—with the added benefit of producing more nutrient-rich soil.Rattan Lal, a professor of soil physics and director of Ohio State University’s Carbon Management and Sequestration Center, is the key scientist behind Gore’s thinking. Lal served on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) when it shared a Nobel Prize with Gore in 2007, and was awarded the Japan Prize this year for his work on soil carbon sequestration.The world’s population currently uses more than a third of the planet’s surface for agriculture, according to the United Nations. In the U.S., close to 40% of land is farmland. Soil used for agriculture has degraded and eroded over centuries of use, losing between 20% and 60% of its original carbon content, according to the IPCC. Lal’s research shows that soil can sequester carbon at rates as high as 2.6 gigatons each year. An aggressive, global combination of tree planting and increased vegetation along with soil carbon sequestration, he said, has the “technical potential” to absorb 157 parts per million of CO2.With about 415 parts per million in the air today—a huge jump compared with a few decades ago—removing even a fraction of that could slow the advance of global warming.“There is virtually no analysis that shows the feasibility of doing any of this at scale.”Gore is realistic when it comes to the fraught politics of climate change and the policies that would need to align to make that potential possible. Moreover, carbon farming is a nascent concept in the U.S.: California has a growing program and Hawaii’s plan to become carbon neutral by 2045 includes a carbon farming framework. U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s “Green New Deal,” supported in some form by several Democratic presidential candidates, simply encourages farmers to improve soil health.But even without any legislation on the horizon, big agriculture is starting to pay attention.Eco-conscious shoppers are beginning to look for food farmed with regenerative practices, just as they do for organic products and sustainable packaging. General Mills set a goal in August to have 1 million acres in its supply chain transitioned to regenerative agriculture by 2030, and a group of companies including Danone North America and Unilever’s Ben & Jerry’s have been working on a certification for food farmed with regenerative practices.Not everyone is convinced its time has come, though. Timothy Searchinger, a research scholar at Princeton University who has studied the issue, said scalable carbon farming is still very much a pipe dream.“There is an unbelievable amount of scientific uncertainty,” Searchinger said. “There is virtually no analysis that shows the feasibility of doing any of this at scale.”Indeed, while there is some evidence that soil carbon can be rebuilt on degraded land, the technique requires putting so much nitrogen in the soil that the technique may not be viable in some places, he said. Additionally, many regenerative farmers discover that after a few years of no-till farming, their yields begin to fall. Searchinger said better options for achieving natural carbon sequestration at scale would be to focus on reducing deforestation and preserving peat lands.“It’s not the most useful thing to do in agriculture,” Searchinger said. While carbon farming would be helpful, he said the bigger agricultural climate issue is methane from livestock, something that might be addressed with feed additives.At its most basic, carbon farming is about leaving the ground alone. Simply plowing and tilling fields can disturb soil’s natural structure, releasing stored carbon into the atmosphere and displacing insects and microbes necessary for healthy soil. No-till farming creates fields that are better at acting like a sponge to absorb both water and carbon.Gore’s home state Tennessee leads the U.S. in no-till farming, with more than 78% of its farmland managed that way, versus 37% for the U.S., according to the Soil Health Institute. On his farm, some 10,000 trees have been planted to increase soil carbon. Small groups of cattle and sheep are rotated to graze in different areas, adding natural fertilizer to soils. The farm uses compost and cover crops to keep the soil healthy, rather than for their profit potential.Regenerative farming has more costs than traditional methods, especially upfront. Only about 108 million acres cross the U.S. are using some regenerative practices, according to Project Drawdown, a climate research group (as of 2012, the government said there were 914 million acres of farmland in America). The group estimates it would cost about $57 billion to convert another 1 billion acres by 2050, but that some 23.15 gigatons of CO2 could be sucked out of the atmosphere by doing so.While not a solution to the climate crisis by itself, Lal told the audience at Gore’s farm that regenerative farming could be, at the very least, “a bridge to the future.”Planting the same cash crops each year without rotating them tends to deplete nutrients from soil. Regenerative farming, meanwhile, results in more nutrient dense-crops. But most farmers don’t have any incentive to change what they are doing, because staples like wheat, rice, soybeans and corn are usually covered by federally-subsidized U.S. crop insurance—a $100 billion industry which currently guarantees that more than 290 million acres of U.S. farmland deliver returns for farmers regardless of the harvest.“For most people, this is a very new idea,” said Will Rodger, director of policy communications at the American Farm Bureau Federation. “We’re certainly aware that carbon can be stored in the soil, but farmers have very narrow margins. Many of our members are looking very closely at it, but the question is how to make it a business.”The U.S. Farmers & Ranchers Alliance proposed earlier this year that lenders find more creative financing models to help farmers employ regenerative practices. A study published this month in Nature Climate Change found that deploying land sector strategies like carbon farming, as well as food waste reduction and increasing plant-based diets, could turn farming into a net absorber of carbon as soon as 2050.Gore predicts that popular adoption of regenerative farming will someday take hold the same way residential solar and electric vehicles have caught on. “Farmers are doing this because they think it’s better for them,” Gore said. “I look for signs of hope.”To contact the author of this story: Emily Chasan in New York at echasan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: David Rovella at drovella@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fZi_K4S7kgMEpAkFCdczMg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/2f9b9b938ffcd69bb8fc199a89eedafd,Al Gore Is Opening a New Front In the War On Climate Change

"Former &lt;/&gt;Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:11:25 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/former-time-editor-wants-hate-211125098.html,"A former Time editor claimed that the United States needs a law banning hate speech, and that President Donald Trump “might be in violation of it” if there were one -- because, apparently, he doesn’t notice the irony of holding both of these views at once.In a Tuesday tweet promoting his Washington Post piece, titled “Why America needs a hate speech law,” Richard Stengel stated:> My @WashingtonPost piece on why the very broadness of the First Amendment suggests we should have a hate speech law. And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f> > -- Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019In the piece, Stengel writes that “many nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred” in the wake of World War II:> These laws started out as protections against the kinds of anti-Semitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws, but there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general, hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.“I’m all for protecting ‘thought that we hate,’ but not speech that incites hate,” he continues. “It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.”It’s interesting how Stengel actually does acknowledge the fact that “there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is,” and yet he still wants laws banning it. This makes absolutely no sense. After all, when he calls for laws to ban “hate speech,” he is, inherently, giving the government the power to decide what would and would not qualify -- the exact same government that is led by Donald Trump, and that is full of people who support him.In other words: Stengel somehow trusts that the government will have the same view of “hate speech” as he does, and then, in the same thought, seems to acknowledge that there’s actually no way that many of them would. Unless he thinks that the president and his congressional supporters would actually pass a law that they’d be in violation of, his argument for “hate speech” laws winds up being a pretty great argument against them.It’s ironic, but it’s not new: More often than not, it’s the uber-progressives arguing for laws against “hate speech” -- despite the fact that they’re often the same people who are also arguing that Donald Trump and Republicans are constantly spewing it. Maybe it’s just me, but if I thought that the leader of my government was, you know, literally Hitler or whatever, the last thing that I’d want would be to give that person and their supporters control over my speech.Yes, the First Amendment gives us the right to be “offensive” with our speech. Given the fact that a new thing seems to be declared “racist” or “sexist” every day, I’m certainly glad that we do have this protection. After all, it would only take there being a few too many of the “super woke” in our government for a phrase like “you guys” to become a criminal offense.The truth is, though, the right to be “offensive” (however you define that subjective term, anyway) is not even the most important role that our First Amendment plays. No, what’s most important is that it protects our right to speak out against the government when we see fit -- without having to worry about its retaliation. Like it or not, the only way to ensure that we retain this important check on government power is to never (ever) give its leaders a vehicle take it away.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eTNessteMBpuBTcqmJGuYw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/bae9af12e23cce197b317b5c1be56053,"Former </>Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony"

Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty ImagesMore than 1,000 homeless people died in Los Angeles county in 2018, double the number of deaths from six years ago. The increase is a stark illustration of the region’s severe housing crisis, advocates said.The LA county public health department reported this week that 1,047 homeless people died last year, a number that has steadily increased every year since 2013, when 536 people died. The leading causes of death were coronary heart disease, which accounted for 22% of deaths, followed by alcohol and drug overdose at 21%, transportation-related injuries at 9%, homicides at 6% and suicides at 5%.The data sheds light on a worsening public health emergency in the county, where officials estimate there are now 59,000 people homeless, including more than 44,000 people who are living unsheltered – in cars, tents, or makeshift quarters. The report also follows a string of high-profile attacks against homeless people in the area, including the killing of Darrell Fields, a beloved musician who was burned to death in his tent on Skid Row.“We’ve got three people a day dying on the streets,” said Adam Rice, an organizer with Los Angeles Community Action Network (LA Can), a group that had worked closely with Fields. “It is a complete failure of leadership. Darrell didn’t need to die. None of these people needed to die. The reason this is happening is because there’s not proper housing.”Darrell Fields, 62, was a homeless man in Los Angeles known as Mr Guitar. He was killed in August when his tent was set ablaze. Photograph: Los Angeles Community Action NetworkSoaring rents and a major shortage of affordable housing have pushed people out of their homes in the area, with more than half of unsheltered adults in a recent count saying they were experiencing homelessness for the first time. The county estimated that there are now 8,800 homeless families.“It brings an overwhelming sadness when you think about precious human beings dying in our streets when it can be avoided,” said the Rev Andy Bales, CEO of Union Rescue Mission (URM), which runs a shelter at Skid Row, at the epicenter of the crisis in downtown LA.The county’s analysis also found that the mortality rate among homeless people has also jumped: “Put simply, being homeless in LA county is becoming increasingly deadly,” the agency wrote.The increase in overdoses represented the largest jump in terms of causes of death, the report found. In addition, the mortality rate among white homeless people has decreased while the rate of deaths for black and Latino residents has increased, the county said. Overall, African Americans are four times more likely to experience homelessness in LA county than other groups.Of the transportation-related deaths, which include vehicle and train collisions, 82% of victims were pedestrians and cyclists.The county and local clinics have increasingly sent healthcare workers to encampments to try to serve people on the streets. More than 21,000 homeless people were also placed in housing last year, an increase from 2017, officials reported early this year.The health department report this week recommended more direct outreach to homeless people, the creation of a “death review team” to study the subject and more traffic safety measures near encampments.Bales predicted that medical visits were not enough to reverse the deadly trends: “What we need most is for everyone to be immediately under a roof and protected from the elements. Until that happens, the death rates will continue to grow … and more and more people will be devastated by homelessness.”The crisis demanded a more urgent response, he added: “How much evidence do we need to gather before we decide not to let another human being die on the street?”LA’s homeless crisis has recently received national attention, with the Trump administration suggesting it could pursue some kind of law enforcement crackdown, drawing skepticism from some local organizations. Advocates have criticized efforts to further criminalize people living on the streets and have argued that the government needs to put more funding to housing and shelter.“It’s really a travesty when you think about it. How many deaths could’ve been prevented?” said Kourtney Milligan, a 29-year-old homeless woman, who has lived on Skid Row. “The resources that they say are out there are so hard to find.”",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/s2XrfBGfKBrVbz9mGlm7bg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/f15aa3ae803200f5d01035f9967bdb02,"More than 1,000 homeless people died in Los Angeles county last year"

"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:17:36 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/record-wave-lone-child-migrants-122133758.html,"TENOSIQUE, Mexico -- The United States has detained more children trying to cross the nation's southwest border on their own over the last year than during any other period on record, surpassing the surge of unaccompanied minors that set off a crisis during the Obama administration, according to new figures released Tuesday.U.S. immigration authorities apprehended 76,020 minors, most of them from Central America, traveling without their parents in the fiscal year that ended in September -- 52% more than during the last fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Mexico is experiencing the same surge. Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period -- pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.In interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous -- and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.""These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,"" Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters. ""And each month during the fiscal year, the numbers increased. You saw them. We all saw them.""The young migrants came alongside a historic wave of families traveling together, also largely from Central America. They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.Marvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced -- and he pressed on.""Quitting was not an option,"" Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. ""You wipe your tears and carry on.""For the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they'd kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.His parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said. ""We can't bear losing another son,"" they told him. ""You have to go.""He left home in the spring, with $40 in his pocket and no plan except to find work in a safer place.As for most underage migrants traveling without their parents, his trip north has been a feat of improvisation and courage. He walked and hitchhiked through Honduras and Guatemala. He slept in churches, under trees or wherever he found himself when night fell.Along the way, he gathered crucial bits of information from fellow migrants: the best route to take, locations of shelters up ahead, places to avoid, where to forage for food.As huge numbers of young migrants from Central America began arriving at the United States' southern border in 2014, the Obama administration scrambled to house them until they could be released to sponsors -- adults who applied to care for them. The shelter system grew dramatically as a result.The Trump administration experienced similar backups at the border just a few years later -- this time because of new, more stringent policies that made the sponsors themselves, who are often undocumented, vulnerable to immigration authorities. This discouraged people from coming forward, leaving thousands of children to languish in the system.The Trump administration has also sought to deter migration by separating thousands of children from their relatives, again driving up the number of children in federally contracted shelters.On the road, while trying to avoid detention, fear and hunger are constant companions for many young migrants.With little or no money in their pockets, they relied on strangers for snacks or meals. They pawed through garbage and scanned drifts of debris on the roadside, hoping to spot an edible morsel.Wilson, a 17-year-old Honduran, said he had feasted on rotten mangos discarded by street vendors.""I used to drink water from potholes when I was too thirsty,"" interjected Mario Leonel, 16, who left home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, several weeks ago without notifying his parents. ""That is the hardest part of it all: the hunger.""When he arrived at the shelter in Tenosique, a small Mexican town near the Guatemala border, he called his parents in Honduras, who burst into tears and pleaded for him to return. He said no. He was tired of all the violence in his country, and wanted to get asylum in the United States.After Marvel slipped across the Guatemala-Mexico border in May, he found room at a shelter in Tenosique, which serves as a transit point for many migrants. He quickly made new friends among other teenage migrants who had made it this far, mainly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador.On a recent afternoon, several of them gathered in a two-story building that had been reserved for minors, its walls painted with colorful animal murals. The boys cracked jokes, roughhoused and argued about who was the cutest girl in the shelter.Outside, Dulce, a 16-year-old transgender migrant from Guatemala, sat alone on train tracks pining for a boy she had met at the shelter. He had left without explanation and she was lovesick.""I just can't get him out of my mind,"" she said.She left her hometown four months earlier to escape abuse from her family and strangers, including a sexual assault by gang members when she was 12. She made it as far as central Mexico before being detained and deported. Five days after returning home, she set off again.""I left because I had nothing there and no one to protect me,"" she said. ""At least here I am safe.""Though the United States remains the destination of choice for most unaccompanied minors, an increasing number are setting their sights no farther than Mexico, advocates and migrants say.Sometimes they have no choice: Mexico's increased enforcement measures have made it more difficult for migrants to make it to the border with the United States. And even if they reach the United States, recent policies have drastically lowered the possibilities of getting asylum.In Mexico, when unaccompanied minors are detained, the law mandates that they be released right away into the custody of the national child protection agency, which finds them accommodation in shelters designed for children.But migrants' advocates say the government has been holding children in the nation's overcrowded detention centers for far too long, and that some children are quickly funneled into the deportation process rather than being given a fair chance to seek asylum or some other form of relief.""No child should ever be held at a detention center,"" said Elba Coria, a migration expert from the Clinic for Refugees at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City. ""But while international standards consider children's detention as an exceptional measure, amid Mexico's migration chaos, it is the rule.""Neither Marvel nor any of his new friends in the Tenosique shelter had been detained by the authorities. All had managed to cross into Mexico from Guatemala and had applied for asylum in Mexico after talking through their options with the shelter staff.They now plan to remain in Mexico and look for work and study opportunities -- even if they haven't abandoned hope of making it to the United States.""It is every Honduran's boy dream to get to the United States, where there is more money and kids are able to go to school,"" said Jose Angel, 17. He was born with a disability that left him unable to use his arms and left his hometown because his grandmother could no longer take care of him.He was hopeful he could apply for asylum in the United States despite Trump's many efforts to severely lower the number of people granted asylum. ""It is scary, but you have to take a chance,"" he said.On a recent morning, Alan, a 17-year-old Guatemalan migrant, sat on the sidewalk outside a migrant shelter in the city of Palenque, in southern Mexico. He had just crossed the border and was exhausted. Mexican immigration officials had stopped a bus he was on, but he managed to escape into the countryside and hide.Alan planned to take a nap, shower and have a meal before trying illegally to board a freight train known as The Beast. It runs from Mexico's border with Guatemala to its border with the United States and, for decades, migrants have clung to it to speed through much of Mexico.His hope was to make it to the U.S. border and petition for asylum. He was undeterred by Trump's recent efforts to restrict asylum claims or curb immigration.""One way or another, I have to make it to the other side where there are skyscrapers and life is better,"" he said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5ol82jExNHqBHa7IGzz2mw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/03f35d3f9d537a8dc9fe503d06c098de,"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation"
Meghan McCain Spars With Cory Booker Over Civility: Beto Was ‘Very Nasty’ to Me!,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:39:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/meghan-mccain-spars-cory-booker-163901660.html,"During a Wednesday interview with Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, The View’s Meghan McCain did what she apparently does best: Make the conversation about herself and, in this case, her personal beef with a presidential hopeful.After applauding Booker for saying Medicare for All is unrealistic, the conservative View co-host took issue with the New Jersey senator’s support for mandatory gun buybacks. This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he’s going to take her brother’s guns.After a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they’d continue the conversation in the next segment.“No we’re not,” McCain grumbled. “It’s fine.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Tucker Carlson and Guest Blame Diversity and ‘Woke’ Culture for California Fires,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 07:17:19 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/tucker-carlson-guest-blame-diversity-032855316.html,"Fox NewsFox News host Tucker Carlson and his guest, conservative YouTube personality Dave Rubin, both insisted Tuesday night that the wildfires burning across California are due largely to progressive ideology, “woke” culture, and diversity in hiring.During Tuesday’s broadcast of Tucker Carlson Tonight, Carlson welcomed on Rubin, a political commentator and podcaster, to discuss the issues surrounding the large fires engulfing the state, including those related to the electrical grid and firefighting methods.“PG&E; strikes me as almost a metaphor for the destruction of the state,” Carlson said about the state’s power company. “Here’s the utility which doesn’t really know anything about its own infrastructure but knows everything about the race of its employees. How did we get there?”After noting that he lives near one of the fires in the Los Angeles area, Rubin immediately took aim at liberal politics as the main reason the wildfires have grown so large and dangerous.“The problem right now is that everything, EVERYTHING, from academia to public utilities to politics, everything that goes woke, that buys into this ridiculous progressive ideology that cares about what contractors are LGBT or how many black firemen we have or white this or Asian that, everything that goes that road eventually breaks down,” he declared.As Carlson nodded and said “that’s true,” Rubin continued, complaining that this isn’t how “freedom is supposed to operate.”“What is supposed to happen—imagine if your house was on fire,” he added. “Would you care what the public utility or what the fire company, what contractor they brought in, what gender or sexuality or any of those things he or she was? It’s just absolutely ridiculous.”The Fox News host continued to agree with Rubin, who went on to tie PG&E;’s preemptive blackouts to a lack of “libertarian or conservative-minded people in California to fight what the progressives are doing to the state.”“If you can’t keep the lights on and you can’t keep the place from burning down, you’ve reached the point where there is no kind of lying about it anymore,” Carlson concluded. “It’s falling apart.

It also stores more than three times as much carbon as forests. Today, agriculture is a net carbon emitter, contributing about 14% of all greenhouse gas emissions, but unlike power generation or automobiles, it can be turned into a net absorber, pulling carbon out of the atmosphere.If farming practices are changed through the use of cover crops, low-tilling and tree-planting, Gore said, agriculture conglomerates and family farmers alike could theoretically make their farms more productive while fighting global warming. Those changes can also replenish nutrients to the world’s soil, of which 33% has already been depleted.A virtuous circle if there ever was one—and one that’s already attracting attention from farmers, consumers and food companies.Gore, 71, is preaching the benefits of so-called carbon farming, a form of regenerative farming, at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump has been trying to roll back regulations meant to limit greenhouse gas emissions. And while science-based climate policy has been a prominent topic on the Democratic presidential campaign trail, it’s not always seen as a priority.Gore, who these days is more of a denim-wearing advocate than reserved technocrat, remains undeterred. His laboratory has been the farm where his parents once raised livestock and grew tobacco. Earlier this month, he invited 450 soil experts—farmers, scientists, chefs, food experts, entrepreneurs and investors—to join him there to discuss how to scale regenerative farming into something that might actually slow climate change.“We’ve waited so long to start to address the climate crisis,” Gore told those gathered. “We will need to both reduce emissions drastically and take as much carbon out of the atmosphere as we possibly can.”Unlike 2006, when Gore’s film “An Inconvenient Truth” was met with skepticism in some quarters, 13 years of intensifying storms, catastrophic floods and unprecedented droughts and wildfires have persuaded more Americans that there’s a very big problem. The goal now, Gore said, is to get people to start taking carbon farming seriously.When it comes to actually tackling what may soon become an existential crisis, the numbers are daunting. Trillions of dollars are needed to adapt civilization to the near-term consequences of climate change while tens of trillions of dollars are needed to slow its advance. But Gore said there are still too few plans to reverse global warming that don’t rely on technology that has yet to be developed.“Planting trees and sequestering carbon in soil are likely to remain the two most effective approaches,” Gore said in an interview at his Carthage farm. “There’s already some indication that farms that operate this way are more resilient in the face of climate extremes.”Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are at their highest in 3 million years. Oceans, the biggest carbon sinks of all, are acidifying because they hold too much of it. Plant life, which absorbs CO2 through photosynthesis, can sink carbon into the soil. Regenerative farming helps speed that along—with the added benefit of producing more nutrient-rich soil.Rattan Lal, a professor of soil physics and director of Ohio State University’s Carbon Management and Sequestration Center, is the key scientist behind Gore’s thinking. Lal served on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) when it shared a Nobel Prize with Gore in 2007, and was awarded the Japan Prize this year for his work on soil carbon sequestration.The world’s population currently uses more than a third of the planet’s surface for agriculture, according to the United Nations. In the U.S., close to 40% of land is farmland. Soil used for agriculture has degraded and eroded over centuries of use, losing between 20% and 60% of its original carbon content, according to the IPCC. Lal’s research shows that soil can sequester carbon at rates as high as 2.6 gigatons each year. An aggressive, global combination of tree planting and increased vegetation along with soil carbon sequestration, he said, has the “technical potential” to absorb 157 parts per million of CO2.With about 415 parts per million in the air today—a huge jump compared with a few decades ago—removing even a fraction of that could slow the advance of global warming.“There is virtually no analysis that shows the feasibility of doing any of this at scale.”Gore is realistic when it comes to the fraught politics of climate change and the policies that would need to align to make that potential possible. Moreover, carbon farming is a nascent concept in the U.S.: California has a growing program and Hawaii’s plan to become carbon neutral by 2045 includes a carbon farming framework. U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s “Green New Deal,” supported in some form by several Democratic presidential candidates, simply encourages farmers to improve soil health.But even without any legislation on the horizon, big agriculture is starting to pay attention.Eco-conscious shoppers are beginning to look for food farmed with regenerative practices, just as they do for organic products and sustainable packaging. General Mills set a goal in August to have 1 million acres in its supply chain transitioned to regenerative agriculture by 2030, and a group of companies including Danone North America and Unilever’s Ben & Jerry’s have been working on a certification for food farmed with regenerative practices.Not everyone is convinced its time has come, though. Timothy Searchinger, a research scholar at Princeton University who has studied the issue, said scalable carbon farming is still very much a pipe dream.“There is an unbelievable amount of scientific uncertainty,” Searchinger said. “There is virtually no analysis that shows the feasibility of doing any of this at scale.”Indeed, while there is some evidence that soil carbon can be rebuilt on degraded land, the technique requires putting so much nitrogen in the soil that the technique may not be viable in some places, he said. Additionally, many regenerative farmers discover that after a few years of no-till farming, their yields begin to fall. Searchinger said better options for achieving natural carbon sequestration at scale would be to focus on reducing deforestation and preserving peat lands.“It’s not the most useful thing to do in agriculture,” Searchinger said. While carbon farming would be helpful, he said the bigger agricultural climate issue is methane from livestock, something that might be addressed with feed additives.At its most basic, carbon farming is about leaving the ground alone. Simply plowing and tilling fields can disturb soil’s natural structure, releasing stored carbon into the atmosphere and displacing insects and microbes necessary for healthy soil. No-till farming creates fields that are better at acting like a sponge to absorb both water and carbon.Gore’s home state Tennessee leads the U.S. in no-till farming, with more than 78% of its farmland managed that way, versus 37% for the U.S., according to the Soil Health Institute. On his farm, some 10,000 trees have been planted to increase soil carbon. Small groups of cattle and sheep are rotated to graze in different areas, adding natural fertilizer to soils. The farm uses compost and cover crops to keep the soil healthy, rather than for their profit potential.Regenerative farming has more costs than traditional methods, especially upfront. Only about 108 million acres cross the U.S. are using some regenerative practices, according to Project Drawdown, a climate research group (as of 2012, the government said there were 914 million acres of farmland in America). The group estimates it would cost about $57 billion to convert another 1 billion acres by 2050, but that some 23.15 gigatons of CO2 could be sucked out of the atmosphere by doing so.While not a solution to the climate crisis by itself, Lal told the audience at Gore’s farm that regenerative farming could be, at the very least, “a bridge to the future.”Planting the same cash crops each year without rotating them tends to deplete nutrients from soil. Regenerative farming, meanwhile, results in more nutrient dense-crops. But most farmers don’t have any incentive to change what they are doing, because staples like wheat, rice, soybeans and corn are usually covered by federally-subsidized U.S. crop insurance—a $100 billion industry which currently guarantees that more than 290 million acres of U.S. farmland deliver returns for farmers regardless of the harvest.“For most people, this is a very new idea,” said Will Rodger, director of policy communications at the American Farm Bureau Federation. “We’re certainly aware that carbon can be stored in the soil, but farmers have very narrow margins. Many of our members are looking very closely at it, but the question is how to make it a business.”The U.S. Farmers & Ranchers Alliance proposed earlier this year that lenders find more creative financing models to help farmers employ regenerative practices. A study published this month in Nature Climate Change found that deploying land sector strategies like carbon farming, as well as food waste reduction and increasing plant-based diets, could turn farming into a net absorber of carbon as soon as 2050.Gore predicts that popular adoption of regenerative farming will someday take hold the same way residential solar and electric vehicles have caught on. “Farmers are doing this because they think it’s better for them,” Gore said. “I look for signs of hope.”To contact the author of this story: Emily Chasan in New York at echasan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: David Rovella at drovella@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fZi_K4S7kgMEpAkFCdczMg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/2f9b9b938ffcd69bb8fc199a89eedafd,Al Gore Is Opening a New Front In the War On Climate Change

"Former &lt;/&gt;Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:11:25 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/former-time-editor-wants-hate-211125098.html,"A former Time editor claimed that the United States needs a law banning hate speech, and that President Donald Trump “might be in violation of it” if there were one -- because, apparently, he doesn’t notice the irony of holding both of these views at once.In a Tuesday tweet promoting his Washington Post piece, titled “Why America needs a hate speech law,” Richard Stengel stated:> My @WashingtonPost piece on why the very broadness of the First Amendment suggests we should have a hate speech law. And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f> > -- Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019In the piece, Stengel writes that “many nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred” in the wake of World War II:> These laws started out as protections against the kinds of anti-Semitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws, but there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general, hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.“I’m all for protecting ‘thought that we hate,’ but not speech that incites hate,” he continues. “It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.”It’s interesting how Stengel actually does acknowledge the fact that “there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is,” and yet he still wants laws banning it. This makes absolutely no sense. After all, when he calls for laws to ban “hate speech,” he is, inherently, giving the government the power to decide what would and would not qualify -- the exact same government that is led by Donald Trump, and that is full of people who support him.In other words: Stengel somehow trusts that the government will have the same view of “hate speech” as he does, and then, in the same thought, seems to acknowledge that there’s actually no way that many of them would. Unless he thinks that the president and his congressional supporters would actually pass a law that they’d be in violation of, his argument for “hate speech” laws winds up being a pretty great argument against them.It’s ironic, but it’s not new: More often than not, it’s the uber-progressives arguing for laws against “hate speech” -- despite the fact that they’re often the same people who are also arguing that Donald Trump and Republicans are constantly spewing it. Maybe it’s just me, but if I thought that the leader of my government was, you know, literally Hitler or whatever, the last thing that I’d want would be to give that person and their supporters control over my speech.Yes, the First Amendment gives us the right to be “offensive” with our speech. Given the fact that a new thing seems to be declared “racist” or “sexist” every day, I’m certainly glad that we do have this protection. After all, it would only take there being a few too many of the “super woke” in our government for a phrase like “you guys” to become a criminal offense.The truth is, though, the right to be “offensive” (however you define that subjective term, anyway) is not even the most important role that our First Amendment plays. No, what’s most important is that it protects our right to speak out against the government when we see fit -- without having to worry about its retaliation. Like it or not, the only way to ensure that we retain this important check on government power is to never (ever) give its leaders a vehicle take it away.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eTNessteMBpuBTcqmJGuYw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/bae9af12e23cce197b317b5c1be56053,"Former </>Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony"

Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty ImagesMore than 1,000 homeless people died in Los Angeles county in 2018, double the number of deaths from six years ago. The increase is a stark illustration of the region’s severe housing crisis, advocates said.The LA county public health department reported this week that 1,047 homeless people died last year, a number that has steadily increased every year since 2013, when 536 people died. The leading causes of death were coronary heart disease, which accounted for 22% of deaths, followed by alcohol and drug overdose at 21%, transportation-related injuries at 9%, homicides at 6% and suicides at 5%.The data sheds light on a worsening public health emergency in the county, where officials estimate there are now 59,000 people homeless, including more than 44,000 people who are living unsheltered – in cars, tents, or makeshift quarters. The report also follows a string of high-profile attacks against homeless people in the area, including the killing of Darrell Fields, a beloved musician who was burned to death in his tent on Skid Row.“We’ve got three people a day dying on the streets,” said Adam Rice, an organizer with Los Angeles Community Action Network (LA Can), a group that had worked closely with Fields. “It is a complete failure of leadership. Darrell didn’t need to die. None of these people needed to die. The reason this is happening is because there’s not proper housing.”Darrell Fields, 62, was a homeless man in Los Angeles known as Mr Guitar. He was killed in August when his tent was set ablaze. Photograph: Los Angeles Community Action NetworkSoaring rents and a major shortage of affordable housing have pushed people out of their homes in the area, with more than half of unsheltered adults in a recent count saying they were experiencing homelessness for the first time. The county estimated that there are now 8,800 homeless families.“It brings an overwhelming sadness when you think about precious human beings dying in our streets when it can be avoided,” said the Rev Andy Bales, CEO of Union Rescue Mission (URM), which runs a shelter at Skid Row, at the epicenter of the crisis in downtown LA.The county’s analysis also found that the mortality rate among homeless people has also jumped: “Put simply, being homeless in LA county is becoming increasingly deadly,” the agency wrote.The increase in overdoses represented the largest jump in terms of causes of death, the report found. In addition, the mortality rate among white homeless people has decreased while the rate of deaths for black and Latino residents has increased, the county said. Overall, African Americans are four times more likely to experience homelessness in LA county than other groups.Of the transportation-related deaths, which include vehicle and train collisions, 82% of victims were pedestrians and cyclists.The county and local clinics have increasingly sent healthcare workers to encampments to try to serve people on the streets. More than 21,000 homeless people were also placed in housing last year, an increase from 2017, officials reported early this year.The health department report this week recommended more direct outreach to homeless people, the creation of a “death review team” to study the subject and more traffic safety measures near encampments.Bales predicted that medical visits were not enough to reverse the deadly trends: “What we need most is for everyone to be immediately under a roof and protected from the elements. Until that happens, the death rates will continue to grow … and more and more people will be devastated by homelessness.”The crisis demanded a more urgent response, he added: “How much evidence do we need to gather before we decide not to let another human being die on the street?”LA’s homeless crisis has recently received national attention, with the Trump administration suggesting it could pursue some kind of law enforcement crackdown, drawing skepticism from some local organizations. Advocates have criticized efforts to further criminalize people living on the streets and have argued that the government needs to put more funding to housing and shelter.“It’s really a travesty when you think about it. How many deaths could’ve been prevented?” said Kourtney Milligan, a 29-year-old homeless woman, who has lived on Skid Row. “The resources that they say are out there are so hard to find.”",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/s2XrfBGfKBrVbz9mGlm7bg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/f15aa3ae803200f5d01035f9967bdb02,"More than 1,000 homeless people died in Los Angeles county last year"

"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:17:36 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/record-wave-lone-child-migrants-122133758.html,"TENOSIQUE, Mexico -- The United States has detained more children trying to cross the nation's southwest border on their own over the last year than during any other period on record, surpassing the surge of unaccompanied minors that set off a crisis during the Obama administration, according to new figures released Tuesday.U.S. immigration authorities apprehended 76,020 minors, most of them from Central America, traveling without their parents in the fiscal year that ended in September -- 52% more than during the last fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Mexico is experiencing the same surge. Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period -- pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.In interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous -- and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.""These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,"" Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters. ""And each month during the fiscal year, the numbers increased. You saw them. We all saw them.""The young migrants came alongside a historic wave of families traveling together, also largely from Central America. They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.Marvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced -- and he pressed on.""Quitting was not an option,"" Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. ""You wipe your tears and carry on.""For the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they'd kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.His parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said. ""We can't bear losing another son,"" they told him. ""You have to go.""He left home in the spring, with $40 in his pocket and no plan except to find work in a safer place.As for most underage migrants traveling without their parents, his trip north has been a feat of improvisation and courage. He walked and hitchhiked through Honduras and Guatemala. He slept in churches, under trees or wherever he found himself when night fell.Along the way, he gathered crucial bits of information from fellow migrants: the best route to take, locations of shelters up ahead, places to avoid, where to forage for food.As huge numbers of young migrants from Central America began arriving at the United States' southern border in 2014, the Obama administration scrambled to house them until they could be released to sponsors -- adults who applied to care for them. The shelter system grew dramatically as a result.The Trump administration experienced similar backups at the border just a few years later -- this time because of new, more stringent policies that made the sponsors themselves, who are often undocumented, vulnerable to immigration authorities. This discouraged people from coming forward, leaving thousands of children to languish in the system.The Trump administration has also sought to deter migration by separating thousands of children from their relatives, again driving up the number of children in federally contracted shelters.On the road, while trying to avoid detention, fear and hunger are constant companions for many young migrants.With little or no money in their pockets, they relied on strangers for snacks or meals. They pawed through garbage and scanned drifts of debris on the roadside, hoping to spot an edible morsel.Wilson, a 17-year-old Honduran, said he had feasted on rotten mangos discarded by street vendors.""I used to drink water from potholes when I was too thirsty,"" interjected Mario Leonel, 16, who left home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, several weeks ago without notifying his parents. ""That is the hardest part of it all: the hunger.""When he arrived at the shelter in Tenosique, a small Mexican town near the Guatemala border, he called his parents in Honduras, who burst into tears and pleaded for him to return. He said no. He was tired of all the violence in his country, and wanted to get asylum in the United States.After Marvel slipped across the Guatemala-Mexico border in May, he found room at a shelter in Tenosique, which serves as a transit point for many migrants. He quickly made new friends among other teenage migrants who had made it this far, mainly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador.On a recent afternoon, several of them gathered in a two-story building that had been reserved for minors, its walls painted with colorful animal murals. The boys cracked jokes, roughhoused and argued about who was the cutest girl in the shelter.Outside, Dulce, a 16-year-old transgender migrant from Guatemala, sat alone on train tracks pining for a boy she had met at the shelter. He had left without explanation and she was lovesick.""I just can't get him out of my mind,"" she said.She left her hometown four months earlier to escape abuse from her family and strangers, including a sexual assault by gang members when she was 12. She made it as far as central Mexico before being detained and deported. Five days after returning home, she set off again.""I left because I had nothing there and no one to protect me,"" she said. ""At least here I am safe.""Though the United States remains the destination of choice for most unaccompanied minors, an increasing number are setting their sights no farther than Mexico, advocates and migrants say.Sometimes they have no choice: Mexico's increased enforcement measures have made it more difficult for migrants to make it to the border with the United States. And even if they reach the United States, recent policies have drastically lowered the possibilities of getting asylum.In Mexico, when unaccompanied minors are detained, the law mandates that they be released right away into the custody of the national child protection agency, which finds them accommodation in shelters designed for children.But migrants' advocates say the government has been holding children in the nation's overcrowded detention centers for far too long, and that some children are quickly funneled into the deportation process rather than being given a fair chance to seek asylum or some other form of relief.""No child should ever be held at a detention center,"" said Elba Coria, a migration expert from the Clinic for Refugees at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City. ""But while international standards consider children's detention as an exceptional measure, amid Mexico's migration chaos, it is the rule.""Neither Marvel nor any of his new friends in the Tenosique shelter had been detained by the authorities. All had managed to cross into Mexico from Guatemala and had applied for asylum in Mexico after talking through their options with the shelter staff.They now plan to remain in Mexico and look for work and study opportunities -- even if they haven't abandoned hope of making it to the United States.""It is every Honduran's boy dream to get to the United States, where there is more money and kids are able to go to school,"" said Jose Angel, 17. He was born with a disability that left him unable to use his arms and left his hometown because his grandmother could no longer take care of him.He was hopeful he could apply for asylum in the United States despite Trump's many efforts to severely lower the number of people granted asylum. ""It is scary, but you have to take a chance,"" he said.On a recent morning, Alan, a 17-year-old Guatemalan migrant, sat on the sidewalk outside a migrant shelter in the city of Palenque, in southern Mexico. He had just crossed the border and was exhausted. Mexican immigration officials had stopped a bus he was on, but he managed to escape into the countryside and hide.Alan planned to take a nap, shower and have a meal before trying illegally to board a freight train known as The Beast. It runs from Mexico's border with Guatemala to its border with the United States and, for decades, migrants have clung to it to speed through much of Mexico.His hope was to make it to the U.S. border and petition for asylum. He was undeterred by Trump's recent efforts to restrict asylum claims or curb immigration.""One way or another, I have to make it to the other side where there are skyscrapers and life is better,"" he said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5ol82jExNHqBHa7IGzz2mw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/03f35d3f9d537a8dc9fe503d06c098de,"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation"
Meghan McCain Spars With Cory Booker Over Civility: Beto Was ‘Very Nasty’ to Me!,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:39:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/meghan-mccain-spars-cory-booker-163901660.html,"During a Wednesday interview with Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, The View’s Meghan McCain did what she apparently does best: Make the conversation about herself and, in this case, her personal beef with a presidential hopeful.After applauding Booker for saying Medicare for All is unrealistic, the conservative View co-host took issue with the New Jersey senator’s support for mandatory gun buybacks. This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he’s going to take her brother’s guns.After a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they’d continue the conversation in the next segment.“No we’re not,” McCain grumbled. “It’s fine.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Tucker Carlson and Guest Blame Diversity and ‘Woke’ Culture for California Fires,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 07:17:19 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/tucker-carlson-guest-blame-diversity-032855316.html,"Fox NewsFox News host Tucker Carlson and his guest, conservative YouTube personality Dave Rubin, both insisted Tuesday night that the wildfires burning across California are due largely to progressive ideology, “woke” culture, and diversity in hiring.During Tuesday’s broadcast of Tucker Carlson Tonight, Carlson welcomed on Rubin, a political commentator and podcaster, to discuss the issues surrounding the large fires engulfing the state, including those related to the electrical grid and firefighting methods.“PG&E; strikes me as almost a metaphor for the destruction of the state,” Carlson said about the state’s power company. “Here’s the utility which doesn’t really know anything about its own infrastructure but knows everything about the race of its employees. How did we get there?”After noting that he lives near one of the fires in the Los Angeles area, Rubin immediately took aim at liberal politics as the main reason the wildfires have grown so large and dangerous.“The problem right now is that everything, EVERYTHING, from academia to public utilities to politics, everything that goes woke, that buys into this ridiculous progressive ideology that cares about what contractors are LGBT or how many black firemen we have or white this or Asian that, everything that goes that road eventually breaks down,” he declared.As Carlson nodded and said “that’s true,” Rubin continued, complaining that this isn’t how “freedom is supposed to operate.”“What is supposed to happen—imagine if your house was on fire,” he added. “Would you care what the public utility or what the fire company, what contractor they brought in, what gender or sexuality or any of those things he or she was? It’s just absolutely ridiculous.”The Fox News host continued to agree with Rubin, who went on to tie PG&E;’s preemptive blackouts to a lack of “libertarian or conservative-minded people in California to fight what the progressives are doing to the state.”“If you can’t keep the lights on and you can’t keep the place from burning down, you’ve reached the point where there is no kind of lying about it anymore,” Carlson concluded. “It’s falling apart.

Al Gore Is Opening a New Front In the War On Climate Change,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 04:00:02 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/al-gore-makes-climate-case-080002432.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Al Gore’s 400-acre farm is located in Carthage, a small Tennessee town where the former vice president and senator traditionally kicked off his political campaigns. During his second act as a famous environmentalist, the farm became the site of a training program for aspiring climate activists, and more recently, an experiment in what Gore said is the world’s most realistic chance at averting climate catastrophe.Topsoil, the foot or so of ground underneath your feet, is responsible for almost all food production on Earth. It also stores more than three times as much carbon as forests. Today, agriculture is a net carbon emitter, contributing about 14% of all greenhouse gas emissions, but unlike power generation or automobiles, it can be turned into a net absorber, pulling carbon out of the atmosphere.If farming practices are changed through the use of cover crops, low-tilling and tree-planting, Gore said, agriculture conglomerates and family farmers alike could theoretically make their farms more productive while fighting global warming. Those changes can also replenish nutrients to the world’s soil, of which 33% has already been depleted.A virtuous circle if there ever was one—and one that’s already attracting attention from farmers, consumers and food companies.Gore, 71, is preaching the benefits of so-called carbon farming, a form of regenerative farming, at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump has been trying to roll back regulations meant to limit greenhouse gas emissions. And while science-based climate policy has been a prominent topic on the Democratic presidential campaign trail, it’s not always seen as a priority.Gore, who these days is more of a denim-wearing advocate than reserved technocrat, remains undeterred. His laboratory has been the farm where his parents once raised livestock and grew tobacco. Earlier this month, he invited 450 soil experts—farmers, scientists, chefs, food experts, entrepreneurs and investors—to join him there to discuss how to scale regenerative farming into something that might actually slow climate change.“We’ve waited so long to start to address the climate crisis,” Gore told those gathered. “We will need to both reduce emissions drastically and take as much carbon out of the atmosphere as we possibly can.”Unlike 2006, when Gore’s film “An Inconvenient Truth” was met with skepticism in some quarters, 13 years of intensifying storms, catastrophic floods and unprecedented droughts and wildfires have persuaded more Americans that there’s a very big problem. The goal now, Gore said, is to get people to start taking carbon farming seriously.When it comes to actually tackling what may soon become an existential crisis, the numbers are daunting. Trillions of dollars are needed to adapt civilization to the near-term consequences of climate change while tens of trillions of dollars are needed to slow its advance. But Gore said there are still too few plans to reverse global warming that don’t rely on technology that has yet to be developed.“Planting trees and sequestering carbon in soil are likely to remain the two most effective approaches,” Gore said in an interview at his Carthage farm. “There’s already some indication that farms that operate this way are more resilient in the face of climate extremes.”Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are at their highest in 3 million years. Oceans, the biggest carbon sinks of all, are acidifying because they hold too much of it. Plant life, which absorbs CO2 through photosynthesis, can sink carbon into the soil. Regenerative farming helps speed that along—with the added benefit of producing more nutrient-rich soil.Rattan Lal, a professor of soil physics and director of Ohio State University’s Carbon Management and Sequestration Center, is the key scientist behind Gore’s thinking. Lal served on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) when it shared a Nobel Prize with Gore in 2007, and was awarded the Japan Prize this year for his work on soil carbon sequestration.The world’s population currently uses more than a third of the planet’s surface for agriculture, according to the United Nations. In the U.S., close to 40% of land is farmland. Soil used for agriculture has degraded and eroded over centuries of use, losing between 20% and 60% of its original carbon content, according to the IPCC. Lal’s research shows that soil can sequester carbon at rates as high as 2.6 gigatons each year. An aggressive, global combination of tree planting and increased vegetation along with soil carbon sequestration, he said, has the “technical potential” to absorb 157 parts per million of CO2.With about 415 parts per million in the air today—a huge jump compared with a few decades ago—removing even a fraction of that could slow the advance of global warming.“There is virtually no analysis that shows the feasibility of doing any of this at scale.”Gore is realistic when it comes to the fraught politics of climate change and the policies that would need to align to make that potential possible. Moreover, carbon farming is a nascent concept in the U.S.: California has a growing program and Hawaii’s plan to become carbon neutral by 2045 includes a carbon farming framework. U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s “Green New Deal,” supported in some form by several Democratic presidential candidates, simply encourages farmers to improve soil health.But even without any legislation on the horizon, big agriculture is starting to pay attention.Eco-conscious shoppers are beginning to look for food farmed with regenerative practices, just as they do for organic products and sustainable packaging. General Mills set a goal in August to have 1 million acres in its supply chain transitioned to regenerative agriculture by 2030, and a group of companies including Danone North America and Unilever’s Ben & Jerry’s have been working on a certification for food farmed with regenerative practices.Not everyone is convinced its time has come, though. Timothy Searchinger, a research scholar at Princeton University who has studied the issue, said scalable carbon farming is still very much a pipe dream.“There is an unbelievable amount of scientific uncertainty,” Searchinger said. “There is virtually no analysis that shows the feasibility of doing any of this at scale.”Indeed, while there is some evidence that soil carbon can be rebuilt on degraded land, the technique requires putting so much nitrogen in the soil that the technique may not be viable in some places, he said. Additionally, many regenerative farmers discover that after a few years of no-till farming, their yields begin to fall. Searchinger said better options for achieving natural carbon sequestration at scale would be to focus on reducing deforestation and preserving peat lands.“It’s not the most useful thing to do in agriculture,” Searchinger said. While carbon farming would be helpful, he said the bigger agricultural climate issue is methane from livestock, something that might be addressed with feed additives.At its most basic, carbon farming is about leaving the ground alone. Simply plowing and tilling fields can disturb soil’s natural structure, releasing stored carbon into the atmosphere and displacing insects and microbes necessary for healthy soil. No-till farming creates fields that are better at acting like a sponge to absorb both water and carbon.Gore’s home state Tennessee leads the U.S. in no-till farming, with more than 78% of its farmland managed that way, versus 37% for the U.S., according to the Soil Health Institute. On his farm, some 10,000 trees have been planted to increase soil carbon. Small groups of cattle and sheep are rotated to graze in different areas, adding natural fertilizer to soils. The farm uses compost and cover crops to keep the soil healthy, rather than for their profit potential.Regenerative farming has more costs than traditional methods, especially upfront. Only about 108 million acres cross the U.S. are using some regenerative practices, according to Project Drawdown, a climate research group (as of 2012, the government said there were 914 million acres of farmland in America). The group estimates it would cost about $57 billion to convert another 1 billion acres by 2050, but that some 23.15 gigatons of CO2 could be sucked out of the atmosphere by doing so.While not a solution to the climate crisis by itself, Lal told the audience at Gore’s farm that regenerative farming could be, at the very least, “a bridge to the future.”Planting the same cash crops each year without rotating them tends to deplete nutrients from soil. Regenerative farming, meanwhile, results in more nutrient dense-crops. But most farmers don’t have any incentive to change what they are doing, because staples like wheat, rice, soybeans and corn are usually covered by federally-subsidized U.S. crop insurance—a $100 billion industry which currently guarantees that more than 290 million acres of U.S. farmland deliver returns for farmers regardless of the harvest.“For most people, this is a very new idea,” said Will Rodger, director of policy communications at the American Farm Bureau Federation. “We’re certainly aware that carbon can be stored in the soil, but farmers have very narrow margins. Many of our members are looking very closely at it, but the question is how to make it a business.”The U.S. Farmers & Ranchers Alliance proposed earlier this year that lenders find more creative financing models to help farmers employ regenerative practices. A study published this month in Nature Climate Change found that deploying land sector strategies like carbon farming, as well as food waste reduction and increasing plant-based diets, could turn farming into a net absorber of carbon as soon as 2050.Gore predicts that popular adoption of regenerative farming will someday take hold the same way residential solar and electric vehicles have caught on. “Farmers are doing this because they think it’s better for them,” Gore said. “I look for signs of hope.”To contact the author of this story: Emily Chasan in New York at echasan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: David Rovella at drovella@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fZi_K4S7kgMEpAkFCdczMg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/2f9b9b938ffcd69bb8fc199a89eedafd,Al Gore Is Opening a New Front In the War On Climate Change

"Former &lt;/&gt;Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:11:25 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/former-time-editor-wants-hate-211125098.html,"A former Time editor claimed that the United States needs a law banning hate speech, and that President Donald Trump “might be in violation of it” if there were one -- because, apparently, he doesn’t notice the irony of holding both of these views at once.In a Tuesday tweet promoting his Washington Post piece, titled “Why America needs a hate speech law,” Richard Stengel stated:> My @WashingtonPost piece on why the very broadness of the First Amendment suggests we should have a hate speech law. And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f> > -- Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019In the piece, Stengel writes that “many nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred” in the wake of World War II:> These laws started out as protections against the kinds of anti-Semitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws, but there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general, hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.“I’m all for protecting ‘thought that we hate,’ but not speech that incites hate,” he continues. “It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.”It’s interesting how Stengel actually does acknowledge the fact that “there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is,” and yet he still wants laws banning it. This makes absolutely no sense. After all, when he calls for laws to ban “hate speech,” he is, inherently, giving the government the power to decide what would and would not qualify -- the exact same government that is led by Donald Trump, and that is full of people who support him.In other words: Stengel somehow trusts that the government will have the same view of “hate speech” as he does, and then, in the same thought, seems to acknowledge that there’s actually no way that many of them would. Unless he thinks that the president and his congressional supporters would actually pass a law that they’d be in violation of, his argument for “hate speech” laws winds up being a pretty great argument against them.It’s ironic, but it’s not new: More often than not, it’s the uber-progressives arguing for laws against “hate speech” -- despite the fact that they’re often the same people who are also arguing that Donald Trump and Republicans are constantly spewing it. Maybe it’s just me, but if I thought that the leader of my government was, you know, literally Hitler or whatever, the last thing that I’d want would be to give that person and their supporters control over my speech.Yes, the First Amendment gives us the right to be “offensive” with our speech. Given the fact that a new thing seems to be declared “racist” or “sexist” every day, I’m certainly glad that we do have this protection. After all, it would only take there being a few too many of the “super woke” in our government for a phrase like “you guys” to become a criminal offense.The truth is, though, the right to be “offensive” (however you define that subjective term, anyway) is not even the most important role that our First Amendment plays. No, what’s most important is that it protects our right to speak out against the government when we see fit -- without having to worry about its retaliation. Like it or not, the only way to ensure that we retain this important check on government power is to never (ever) give its leaders a vehicle take it away.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eTNessteMBpuBTcqmJGuYw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/bae9af12e23cce197b317b5c1be56053,"Former </>Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony"

"More than 1,000 homeless people died in Los Angeles county last year","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 16:20:14 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/homeless-deaths-la-county-double-202014816.html,"The county’s public health department has reported 1,047 deaths for last year, a number that has increased steadily since 2013A woman pushes a cart full of her belongings past tents near Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles. Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty ImagesMore than 1,000 homeless people died in Los Angeles county in 2018, double the number of deaths from six years ago. The increase is a stark illustration of the region’s severe housing crisis, advocates said.The LA county public health department reported this week that 1,047 homeless people died last year, a number that has steadily increased every year since 2013, when 536 people died. The leading causes of death were coronary heart disease, which accounted for 22% of deaths, followed by alcohol and drug overdose at 21%, transportation-related injuries at 9%, homicides at 6% and suicides at 5%.The data sheds light on a worsening public health emergency in the county, where officials estimate there are now 59,000 people homeless, including more than 44,000 people who are living unsheltered – in cars, tents, or makeshift quarters. The report also follows a string of high-profile attacks against homeless people in the area, including the killing of Darrell Fields, a beloved musician who was burned to death in his tent on Skid Row.“We’ve got three people a day dying on the streets,” said Adam Rice, an organizer with Los Angeles Community Action Network (LA Can), a group that had worked closely with Fields. “It is a complete failure of leadership. Darrell didn’t need to die. None of these people needed to die. The reason this is happening is because there’s not proper housing.”Darrell Fields, 62, was a homeless man in Los Angeles known as Mr Guitar. He was killed in August when his tent was set ablaze. Photograph: Los Angeles Community Action NetworkSoaring rents and a major shortage of affordable housing have pushed people out of their homes in the area, with more than half of unsheltered adults in a recent count saying they were experiencing homelessness for the first time. The county estimated that there are now 8,800 homeless families.“It brings an overwhelming sadness when you think about precious human beings dying in our streets when it can be avoided,” said the Rev Andy Bales, CEO of Union Rescue Mission (URM), which runs a shelter at Skid Row, at the epicenter of the crisis in downtown LA.The county’s analysis also found that the mortality rate among homeless people has also jumped: “Put simply, being homeless in LA county is becoming increasingly deadly,” the agency wrote.The increase in overdoses represented the largest jump in terms of causes of death, the report found. In addition, the mortality rate among white homeless people has decreased while the rate of deaths for black and Latino residents has increased, the county said. Overall, African Americans are four times more likely to experience homelessness in LA county than other groups.Of the transportation-related deaths, which include vehicle and train collisions, 82% of victims were pedestrians and cyclists.The county and local clinics have increasingly sent healthcare workers to encampments to try to serve people on the streets. More than 21,000 homeless people were also placed in housing last year, an increase from 2017, officials reported early this year.The health department report this week recommended more direct outreach to homeless people, the creation of a “death review team” to study the subject and more traffic safety measures near encampments.Bales predicted that medical visits were not enough to reverse the deadly trends: “What we need most is for everyone to be immediately under a roof and protected from the elements. Until that happens, the death rates will continue to grow … and more and more people will be devastated by homelessness.”The crisis demanded a more urgent response, he added: “How much evidence do we need to gather before we decide not to let another human being die on the street?”LA’s homeless crisis has recently received national attention, with the Trump administration suggesting it could pursue some kind of law enforcement crackdown, drawing skepticism from some local organizations. Advocates have criticized efforts to further criminalize people living on the streets and have argued that the government needs to put more funding to housing and shelter.“It’s really a travesty when you think about it. How many deaths could’ve been prevented?” said Kourtney Milligan, a 29-year-old homeless woman, who has lived on Skid Row. “The resources that they say are out there are so hard to find.”",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/s2XrfBGfKBrVbz9mGlm7bg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/f15aa3ae803200f5d01035f9967bdb02,"More than 1,000 homeless people died in Los Angeles county last year"

"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:17:36 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/record-wave-lone-child-migrants-122133758.html,"TENOSIQUE, Mexico -- The United States has detained more children trying to cross the nation's southwest border on their own over the last year than during any other period on record, surpassing the surge of unaccompanied minors that set off a crisis during the Obama administration, according to new figures released Tuesday.U.S. immigration authorities apprehended 76,020 minors, most of them from Central America, traveling without their parents in the fiscal year that ended in September -- 52% more than during the last fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Mexico is experiencing the same surge. Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period -- pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.In interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous -- and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.""These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,"" Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters. ""And each month during the fiscal year, the numbers increased. You saw them. We all saw them.""The young migrants came alongside a historic wave of families traveling together, also largely from Central America. They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.Marvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced -- and he pressed on.""Quitting was not an option,"" Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. ""You wipe your tears and carry on.""For the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they'd kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.His parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said. ""We can't bear losing another son,"" they told him. ""You have to go.""He left home in the spring, with $40 in his pocket and no plan except to find work in a safer place.As for most underage migrants traveling without their parents, his trip north has been a feat of improvisation and courage. He walked and hitchhiked through Honduras and Guatemala. He slept in churches, under trees or wherever he found himself when night fell.Along the way, he gathered crucial bits of information from fellow migrants: the best route to take, locations of shelters up ahead, places to avoid, where to forage for food.As huge numbers of young migrants from Central America began arriving at the United States' southern border in 2014, the Obama administration scrambled to house them until they could be released to sponsors -- adults who applied to care for them. The shelter system grew dramatically as a result.The Trump administration experienced similar backups at the border just a few years later -- this time because of new, more stringent policies that made the sponsors themselves, who are often undocumented, vulnerable to immigration authorities. This discouraged people from coming forward, leaving thousands of children to languish in the system.The Trump administration has also sought to deter migration by separating thousands of children from their relatives, again driving up the number of children in federally contracted shelters.On the road, while trying to avoid detention, fear and hunger are constant companions for many young migrants.With little or no money in their pockets, they relied on strangers for snacks or meals. They pawed through garbage and scanned drifts of debris on the roadside, hoping to spot an edible morsel.Wilson, a 17-year-old Honduran, said he had feasted on rotten mangos discarded by street vendors.""I used to drink water from potholes when I was too thirsty,"" interjected Mario Leonel, 16, who left home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, several weeks ago without notifying his parents. ""That is the hardest part of it all: the hunger.""When he arrived at the shelter in Tenosique, a small Mexican town near the Guatemala border, he called his parents in Honduras, who burst into tears and pleaded for him to return. He said no. He was tired of all the violence in his country, and wanted to get asylum in the United States.After Marvel slipped across the Guatemala-Mexico border in May, he found room at a shelter in Tenosique, which serves as a transit point for many migrants. He quickly made new friends among other teenage migrants who had made it this far, mainly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador.On a recent afternoon, several of them gathered in a two-story building that had been reserved for minors, its walls painted with colorful animal murals. The boys cracked jokes, roughhoused and argued about who was the cutest girl in the shelter.Outside, Dulce, a 16-year-old transgender migrant from Guatemala, sat alone on train tracks pining for a boy she had met at the shelter. He had left without explanation and she was lovesick.""I just can't get him out of my mind,"" she said.She left her hometown four months earlier to escape abuse from her family and strangers, including a sexual assault by gang members when she was 12. She made it as far as central Mexico before being detained and deported. Five days after returning home, she set off again.""I left because I had nothing there and no one to protect me,"" she said. ""At least here I am safe.""Though the United States remains the destination of choice for most unaccompanied minors, an increasing number are setting their sights no farther than Mexico, advocates and migrants say.Sometimes they have no choice: Mexico's increased enforcement measures have made it more difficult for migrants to make it to the border with the United States. And even if they reach the United States, recent policies have drastically lowered the possibilities of getting asylum.In Mexico, when unaccompanied minors are detained, the law mandates that they be released right away into the custody of the national child protection agency, which finds them accommodation in shelters designed for children.But migrants' advocates say the government has been holding children in the nation's overcrowded detention centers for far too long, and that some children are quickly funneled into the deportation process rather than being given a fair chance to seek asylum or some other form of relief.""No child should ever be held at a detention center,"" said Elba Coria, a migration expert from the Clinic for Refugees at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City. ""But while international standards consider children's detention as an exceptional measure, amid Mexico's migration chaos, it is the rule.""Neither Marvel nor any of his new friends in the Tenosique shelter had been detained by the authorities. All had managed to cross into Mexico from Guatemala and had applied for asylum in Mexico after talking through their options with the shelter staff.They now plan to remain in Mexico and look for work and study opportunities -- even if they haven't abandoned hope of making it to the United States.""It is every Honduran's boy dream to get to the United States, where there is more money and kids are able to go to school,"" said Jose Angel, 17. He was born with a disability that left him unable to use his arms and left his hometown because his grandmother could no longer take care of him.He was hopeful he could apply for asylum in the United States despite Trump's many efforts to severely lower the number of people granted asylum. ""It is scary, but you have to take a chance,"" he said.On a recent morning, Alan, a 17-year-old Guatemalan migrant, sat on the sidewalk outside a migrant shelter in the city of Palenque, in southern Mexico. He had just crossed the border and was exhausted. Mexican immigration officials had stopped a bus he was on, but he managed to escape into the countryside and hide.Alan planned to take a nap, shower and have a meal before trying illegally to board a freight train known as The Beast. It runs from Mexico's border with Guatemala to its border with the United States and, for decades, migrants have clung to it to speed through much of Mexico.His hope was to make it to the U.S. border and petition for asylum. He was undeterred by Trump's recent efforts to restrict asylum claims or curb immigration.""One way or another, I have to make it to the other side where there are skyscrapers and life is better,"" he said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5ol82jExNHqBHa7IGzz2mw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/03f35d3f9d537a8dc9fe503d06c098de,"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation"
Meghan McCain Spars With Cory Booker Over Civility: Beto Was ‘Very Nasty’ to Me!,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:39:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/meghan-mccain-spars-cory-booker-163901660.html,"During a Wednesday interview with Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, The View’s Meghan McCain did what she apparently does best: Make the conversation about herself and, in this case, her personal beef with a presidential hopeful.After applauding Booker for saying Medicare for All is unrealistic, the conservative View co-host took issue with the New Jersey senator’s support for mandatory gun buybacks. This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he’s going to take her brother’s guns.After a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they’d continue the conversation in the next segment.“No we’re not,” McCain grumbled. “It’s fine.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Tucker Carlson and Guest Blame Diversity and ‘Woke’ Culture for California Fires,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 07:17:19 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/tucker-carlson-guest-blame-diversity-032855316.html,"Fox NewsFox News host Tucker Carlson and his guest, conservative YouTube personality Dave Rubin, both insisted Tuesday night that the wildfires burning across California are due largely to progressive ideology, “woke” culture, and diversity in hiring.During Tuesday’s broadcast of Tucker Carlson Tonight, Carlson welcomed on Rubin, a political commentator and podcaster, to discuss the issues surrounding the large fires engulfing the state, including those related to the electrical grid and firefighting methods.“PG&E; strikes me as almost a metaphor for the destruction of the state,” Carlson said about the state’s power company. “Here’s the utility which doesn’t really know anything about its own infrastructure but knows everything about the race of its employees. How did we get there?”After noting that he lives near one of the fires in the Los Angeles area, Rubin immediately took aim at liberal politics as the main reason the wildfires have grown so large and dangerous.“The problem right now is that everything, EVERYTHING, from academia to public utilities to politics, everything that goes woke, that buys into this ridiculous progressive ideology that cares about what contractors are LGBT or how many black firemen we have or white this or Asian that, everything that goes that road eventually breaks down,” he declared.As Carlson nodded and said “that’s true,” Rubin continued, complaining that this isn’t how “freedom is supposed to operate.”“What is supposed to happen—imagine if your house was on fire,” he added. “Would you care what the public utility or what the fire company, what contractor they brought in, what gender or sexuality or any of those things he or she was? It’s just absolutely ridiculous.”The Fox News host continued to agree with Rubin, who went on to tie PG&E;’s preemptive blackouts to a lack of “libertarian or conservative-minded people in California to fight what the progressives are doing to the state.”“If you can’t keep the lights on and you can’t keep the place from burning down, you’ve reached the point where there is no kind of lying about it anymore,” Carlson concluded. “It’s falling apart.

A staffer sitting behind her was captured on video as her eyes widened in shock.""You have demonstrated that you will pursue this heinous white supremacist ideology at all costs,"" said Wasserman Schultz. Cuccinelli answered that neither he nor the President was a white supremacist.""That's false,"" Cuccinelli said, calling Wasserman Schultz's statements ""defamatory.""Cuccinelli had been summoned to the hearing to discuss the Trump administration's decision to temporarily stop granting deportation deferments for illegal aliens receiving life-saving treatment in the U.S.Representative Ayanna Pressley (D., Ohio) also entered into a heated exchange with Cuccinelli over who was responsible for the decision, himself or White House officials.

However, Senator Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) said the idea was a non-starter.“It’s my understanding that the existing law would not permit him to” lead the organization, Grassley said. “I don’t know how you get around that.” Grassley was referring to current laws that govern succession rules within the federal government.On Tuesday, a top Border Patrol official warned that illegal immigration could hit crisis levels if courts keep blocking Trump's immigration policies.""We will go back, mark the words, we will go back to the crisis level that we had before,"" said chief of law enforcement operations for the Border Patrol Brian Hastings.

"Former &lt;/&gt;Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:11:25 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/former-time-editor-wants-hate-211125098.html,"A former Time editor claimed that the United States needs a law banning hate speech, and that President Donald Trump “might be in violation of it” if there were one -- because, apparently, he doesn’t notice the irony of holding both of these views at once.In a Tuesday tweet promoting his Washington Post piece, titled “Why America needs a hate speech law,” Richard Stengel stated:> My @WashingtonPost piece on why the very broadness of the First Amendment suggests we should have a hate speech law. And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f> > -- Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019In the piece, Stengel writes that “many nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred” in the wake of World War II:> These laws started out as protections against the kinds of anti-Semitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws, but there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general, hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.“I’m all for protecting ‘thought that we hate,’ but not speech that incites hate,” he continues. “It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.”It’s interesting how Stengel actually does acknowledge the fact that “there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is,” and yet he still wants laws banning it. This makes absolutely no sense. After all, when he calls for laws to ban “hate speech,” he is, inherently, giving the government the power to decide what would and would not qualify -- the exact same government that is led by Donald Trump, and that is full of people who support him.In other words: Stengel somehow trusts that the government will have the same view of “hate speech” as he does, and then, in the same thought, seems to acknowledge that there’s actually no way that many of them would. Unless he thinks that the president and his congressional supporters would actually pass a law that they’d be in violation of, his argument for “hate speech” laws winds up being a pretty great argument against them.It’s ironic, but it’s not new: More often than not, it’s the uber-progressives arguing for laws against “hate speech” -- despite the fact that they’re often the same people who are also arguing that Donald Trump and Republicans are constantly spewing it. Maybe it’s just me, but if I thought that the leader of my government was, you know, literally Hitler or whatever, the last thing that I’d want would be to give that person and their supporters control over my speech.Yes, the First Amendment gives us the right to be “offensive” with our speech. Given the fact that a new thing seems to be declared “racist” or “sexist” every day, I’m certainly glad that we do have this protection. After all, it would only take there being a few too many of the “super woke” in our government for a phrase like “you guys” to become a criminal offense.The truth is, though, the right to be “offensive” (however you define that subjective term, anyway) is not even the most important role that our First Amendment plays. No, what’s most important is that it protects our right to speak out against the government when we see fit -- without having to worry about its retaliation. Like it or not, the only way to ensure that we retain this important check on government power is to never (ever) give its leaders a vehicle take it away.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eTNessteMBpuBTcqmJGuYw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/bae9af12e23cce197b317b5c1be56053,"Former </>Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony"

"White House blocked effort to condemn Russia for seizing Ukraine ships, Congress told","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 16:46:00 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/white-house-blocked-effort-condemn-204600202.html,"State department aide makes revelation in testimony, while Russia envoy nominee John Sullivan grilled at confirmation hearingDonald Trump with Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Osaka in June this year. Trump voiced concern over the 2018 capture but did not blame Moscow. Photograph: Mikhail Klimentyev/TassThe White House blocked the US state department from issuing a statement condemning Russia for seizing Ukrainian military vessels, according to a state department official, in the latest example of the strain the Trump administration is under in pursuing conflicting policies towards the two countries.The revelation on Wednesday came from Christopher Anderson, who was a senior aide to the special envoy on Ukraine, Kurt Volker, in November 2018, when Russia fired on and captured three Ukrainian vessels in the Sea of Azov off the Crimean peninsula.“While my colleagues at the state department quickly prepared a statement condemning Russia for its escalation, senior officials in the White House blocked it from being issued,” Anderson said in his prepared remarks to congressional committees holding impeachment hearings. “Ambassador Volker drafted a tweet condemning Russia’s actions, which I posted to his account.”In the face of silence from the White House, the then US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, condemned Russian behaviour, after which the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, followed suit. Trump voiced concern but did not blame Moscow.The 24 Ukrainian sailors detained in the operation were returned last month as part of a prisoner exchange.Anderson, and his successor in the Ukraine job, Catherine Croft, both testified to House committees on Wednesday about the role played by Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, in foiling state department efforts to bolster the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in the face of Russian military intervention in eastern Ukraine.In his testimony, Anderson quoted the former national security adviser, John Bolton, as saying: “Giuliani was a key voice with the president on Ukraine which could be an obstacle to increased White House engagement.” On Wednesday, the House committees asked Bolton to testify on 7 November, but it is unclear whether he will attend.Bolton’s former deputy, Charles Kupperman, is currently seeking a court ruling on whether to comply with his congressional subpoena in the face of a White House order not to testify.At the other side of Congress, the nominee to become ambassador to Russia, John Sullivan, faced pointed questions on Wednesday at confirmation hearings in the Senate about Giuliani and the split US policy towards Russia and Ukraine.Sullivan, currently the deputy secretary of state, said he was aware of Giuliani’s role in a campaign against the former US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. Asked if he knew Trump’s lawyer was “seeking to smear” Yovanovitch, he replied: “I believe he was, yes.”Sullivan confirmed he had been shown a dossier of material attacking Yovanovitch, saying it had provided by the White House to the state department legal adviser, but he was not aware it had been put together by Giuliani. He said the dossier “didn’t provide to me a basis for taking action against our ambassador”.He said that Pompeo gave Sullivan no explanation for the decision to recall Yovanovitch before the end of her posting, other than she had “lost the confidence of the president”.“As I understand, [Trump] may decide that he doesn’t like my testimony today and he doesn’t want me to go to Russia. The president can decide when he loses confidence in his ambassador – then that person is not going to continue as ambassador,” Sullivan said.Sullivan sought to avoid taking a position on the testimony by several former and current state department officials that the president, through Giuliani, had made a White House meeting and US military aid dependent on the Ukrainian government investigating Trump’s political rivals.“Soliciting investigations into a domestic political opponent – I don’t think that would be in accord with our values,” Sullivan said. But he would not confirm that was what the president had done.Democratic senators signaled that they were prepared to support Sullivan’s nomination as an experienced and respected diplomat, acknowledging the difficult position he was in. But they expressed concern he had not done more to find out what Trump and Giuliani were trying to achieve in Ukraine.The ranking Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee, Bob Menendez, told Sullivan he had been playing the role of “see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.”“You’re going to go to Russia, and you’re going to be saying one set of things based upon your testimony here,” Menendez said. “And we have the president who, in his public statements, is totally aligned differently than what you’re going to be saying.”“Do you understand the incredibly difficult job that you’re going to have as a result of that?” Menendez asked Sullivan.“I would say, senator, you’ve cited the president’s statements. I’d cite the president’s actions,” the nominee replied, listing sanctions the administration had imposed on Russia.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3dFxIoizaUY49lyZT_4bZQ--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/e71dc403755334597d5e870705964abd,"White House blocked effort to condemn Russia for seizing Ukraine ships, Congress told"
D.C. Panel Halts Release of Mueller Documents at DOJ’s Request,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 09:02:23 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/d-c-panel-halts-release-130223421.html,"The D.C. Circuit for the U.S. Court of Appeals on Tuesday night halted the scheduled release of grand-jury materials from Robert Mueller’s investigation, just hours ahead of the scheduled distribution.The decision came after a federal judge ruled last Friday that the Justice Department must release unredacted material from the original Mueller investigation, a move House Democrats have clamored for in the midst of the ongoing impeachment inquiry.Judge Beryl Howell, an Obama appointee, wrote that the committee “has shown that it needs the grand jury material referenced and cited in the Mueller Report to avoid a possible injustice in the impeachment inquiry.”The DOJ contested Howell’s ruling and issued an emergency appeal, saying a quick release “threatens an irreparable loss of grand-jury secrecy before this court even has a chance to act on the Department’s stay motion.” The government also noted that Howell gave no explanation for her seemingly arbitrary deadline of Wednesday, which was not offered by Democrats.The three-judge D.C. panel — made up of judges appointed by Barack Obama — decided on an administrative stay in order “to give the court sufficient opportunity to consider the emergency motion for stay pending appeal and should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits of that motion,” according to the decision.The debate centers around the validity of redactions to a grand-jury deposition, which is usually kept secret. The DOJ argues that materials in the report are squarely protected by federal evidence regulations, while others point to ongoing criminal matters involved, including a probe by Connecticut U.S attorney John Durham the origins of the investigation. House Democrats counter that secrecy rules do not apply to the impeachment inquiry, which is a judicial proceeding.",http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/w_heEZnk1hoDQSTVWqjVSg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/5cc14c5df368875c0317fc539bb227fd,D.C.

"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:17:36 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/record-wave-lone-child-migrants-122133758.html,"TENOSIQUE, Mexico -- The United States has detained more children trying to cross the nation's southwest border on their own over the last year than during any other period on record, surpassing the surge of unaccompanied minors that set off a crisis during the Obama administration, according to new figures released Tuesday.U.S. immigration authorities apprehended 76,020 minors, most of them from Central America, traveling without their parents in the fiscal year that ended in September -- 52% more than during the last fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Mexico is experiencing the same surge. Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period -- pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.In interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous -- and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.""These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,"" Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters. ""And each month during the fiscal year, the numbers increased. You saw them. We all saw them.""The young migrants came alongside a historic wave of families traveling together, also largely from Central America. They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.Marvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced -- and he pressed on.""Quitting was not an option,"" Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. ""You wipe your tears and carry on.""For the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they'd kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.His parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said. ""We can't bear losing another son,"" they told him. ""You have to go.""He left home in the spring, with $40 in his pocket and no plan except to find work in a safer place.As for most underage migrants traveling without their parents, his trip north has been a feat of improvisation and courage. He walked and hitchhiked through Honduras and Guatemala. He slept in churches, under trees or wherever he found himself when night fell.Along the way, he gathered crucial bits of information from fellow migrants: the best route to take, locations of shelters up ahead, places to avoid, where to forage for food.As huge numbers of young migrants from Central America began arriving at the United States' southern border in 2014, the Obama administration scrambled to house them until they could be released to sponsors -- adults who applied to care for them. The shelter system grew dramatically as a result.The Trump administration experienced similar backups at the border just a few years later -- this time because of new, more stringent policies that made the sponsors themselves, who are often undocumented, vulnerable to immigration authorities. This discouraged people from coming forward, leaving thousands of children to languish in the system.The Trump administration has also sought to deter migration by separating thousands of children from their relatives, again driving up the number of children in federally contracted shelters.On the road, while trying to avoid detention, fear and hunger are constant companions for many young migrants.With little or no money in their pockets, they relied on strangers for snacks or meals. They pawed through garbage and scanned drifts of debris on the roadside, hoping to spot an edible morsel.Wilson, a 17-year-old Honduran, said he had feasted on rotten mangos discarded by street vendors.""I used to drink water from potholes when I was too thirsty,"" interjected Mario Leonel, 16, who left home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, several weeks ago without notifying his parents. ""That is the hardest part of it all: the hunger.""When he arrived at the shelter in Tenosique, a small Mexican town near the Guatemala border, he called his parents in Honduras, who burst into tears and pleaded for him to return. He said no. He was tired of all the violence in his country, and wanted to get asylum in the United States.After Marvel slipped across the Guatemala-Mexico border in May, he found room at a shelter in Tenosique, which serves as a transit point for many migrants. He quickly made new friends among other teenage migrants who had made it this far, mainly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador.On a recent afternoon, several of them gathered in a two-story building that had been reserved for minors, its walls painted with colorful animal murals. The boys cracked jokes, roughhoused and argued about who was the cutest girl in the shelter.Outside, Dulce, a 16-year-old transgender migrant from Guatemala, sat alone on train tracks pining for a boy she had met at the shelter. He had left without explanation and she was lovesick.""I just can't get him out of my mind,"" she said.She left her hometown four months earlier to escape abuse from her family and strangers, including a sexual assault by gang members when she was 12. She made it as far as central Mexico before being detained and deported. Five days after returning home, she set off again.""I left because I had nothing there and no one to protect me,"" she said. ""At least here I am safe.""Though the United States remains the destination of choice for most unaccompanied minors, an increasing number are setting their sights no farther than Mexico, advocates and migrants say.Sometimes they have no choice: Mexico's increased enforcement measures have made it more difficult for migrants to make it to the border with the United States. And even if they reach the United States, recent policies have drastically lowered the possibilities of getting asylum.In Mexico, when unaccompanied minors are detained, the law mandates that they be released right away into the custody of the national child protection agency, which finds them accommodation in shelters designed for children.But migrants' advocates say the government has been holding children in the nation's overcrowded detention centers for far too long, and that some children are quickly funneled into the deportation process rather than being given a fair chance to seek asylum or some other form of relief.""No child should ever be held at a detention center,"" said Elba Coria, a migration expert from the Clinic for Refugees at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City. ""But while international standards consider children's detention as an exceptional measure, amid Mexico's migration chaos, it is the rule.""Neither Marvel nor any of his new friends in the Tenosique shelter had been detained by the authorities. All had managed to cross into Mexico from Guatemala and had applied for asylum in Mexico after talking through their options with the shelter staff.They now plan to remain in Mexico and look for work and study opportunities -- even if they haven't abandoned hope of making it to the United States.""It is every Honduran's boy dream to get to the United States, where there is more money and kids are able to go to school,"" said Jose Angel, 17. He was born with a disability that left him unable to use his arms and left his hometown because his grandmother could no longer take care of him.He was hopeful he could apply for asylum in the United States despite Trump's many efforts to severely lower the number of people granted asylum. ""It is scary, but you have to take a chance,"" he said.On a recent morning, Alan, a 17-year-old Guatemalan migrant, sat on the sidewalk outside a migrant shelter in the city of Palenque, in southern Mexico. He had just crossed the border and was exhausted. Mexican immigration officials had stopped a bus he was on, but he managed to escape into the countryside and hide.Alan planned to take a nap, shower and have a meal before trying illegally to board a freight train known as The Beast. It runs from Mexico's border with Guatemala to its border with the United States and, for decades, migrants have clung to it to speed through much of Mexico.His hope was to make it to the U.S. border and petition for asylum. He was undeterred by Trump's recent efforts to restrict asylum claims or curb immigration.""One way or another, I have to make it to the other side where there are skyscrapers and life is better,"" he said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5ol82jExNHqBHa7IGzz2mw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/03f35d3f9d537a8dc9fe503d06c098de,"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation"
Meghan McCain Spars With Cory Booker Over Civility: Beto Was ‘Very Nasty’ to Me!,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:39:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/meghan-mccain-spars-cory-booker-163901660.html,"During a Wednesday interview with Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, The View’s Meghan McCain did what she apparently does best: Make the conversation about herself and, in this case, her personal beef with a presidential hopeful.After applauding Booker for saying Medicare for All is unrealistic, the conservative View co-host took issue with the New Jersey senator’s support for mandatory gun buybacks. This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he’s going to take her brother’s guns.After a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they’d continue the conversation in the next segment.“No we’re not,” McCain grumbled. “It’s fine.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Tucker Carlson and Guest Blame Diversity and ‘Woke’ Culture for California Fires,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 07:17:19 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/tucker-carlson-guest-blame-diversity-032855316.html,"Fox NewsFox News host Tucker Carlson and his guest, conservative YouTube personality Dave Rubin, both insisted Tuesday night that the wildfires burning across California are due largely to progressive ideology, “woke” culture, and diversity in hiring.During Tuesday’s broadcast of Tucker Carlson Tonight, Carlson welcomed on Rubin, a political commentator and podcaster, to discuss the issues surrounding the large fires engulfing the state, including those related to the electrical grid and firefighting methods.“PG&E; strikes me as almost a metaphor for the destruction of the state,” Carlson said about the state’s power company. “Here’s the utility which doesn’t really know anything about its own infrastructure but knows everything about the race of its employees. How did we get there?”After noting that he lives near one of the fires in the Los Angeles area, Rubin immediately took aim at liberal politics as the main reason the wildfires have grown so large and dangerous.“The problem right now is that everything, EVERYTHING, from academia to public utilities to politics, everything that goes woke, that buys into this ridiculous progressive ideology that cares about what contractors are LGBT or how many black firemen we have or white this or Asian that, everything that goes that road eventually breaks down,” he declared.As Carlson nodded and said “that’s true,” Rubin continued, complaining that this isn’t how “freedom is supposed to operate.”“What is supposed to happen—imagine if your house was on fire,” he added. “Would you care what the public utility or what the fire company, what contractor they brought in, what gender or sexuality or any of those things he or she was? It’s just absolutely ridiculous.”The Fox News host continued to agree with Rubin, who went on to tie PG&E;’s preemptive blackouts to a lack of “libertarian or conservative-minded people in California to fight what the progressives are doing to the state.”“If you can’t keep the lights on and you can’t keep the place from burning down, you’ve reached the point where there is no kind of lying about it anymore,” Carlson concluded. “It’s falling apart.

"Former &lt;/&gt;Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:11:25 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/former-time-editor-wants-hate-211125098.html,"A former Time editor claimed that the United States needs a law banning hate speech, and that President Donald Trump “might be in violation of it” if there were one -- because, apparently, he doesn’t notice the irony of holding both of these views at once.In a Tuesday tweet promoting his Washington Post piece, titled “Why America needs a hate speech law,” Richard Stengel stated:> My @WashingtonPost piece on why the very broadness of the First Amendment suggests we should have a hate speech law. And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f> > -- Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019In the piece, Stengel writes that “many nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred” in the wake of World War II:> These laws started out as protections against the kinds of anti-Semitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws, but there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general, hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.“I’m all for protecting ‘thought that we hate,’ but not speech that incites hate,” he continues. “It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.”It’s interesting how Stengel actually does acknowledge the fact that “there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is,” and yet he still wants laws banning it. This makes absolutely no sense. After all, when he calls for laws to ban “hate speech,” he is, inherently, giving the government the power to decide what would and would not qualify -- the exact same government that is led by Donald Trump, and that is full of people who support him.In other words: Stengel somehow trusts that the government will have the same view of “hate speech” as he does, and then, in the same thought, seems to acknowledge that there’s actually no way that many of them would. Unless he thinks that the president and his congressional supporters would actually pass a law that they’d be in violation of, his argument for “hate speech” laws winds up being a pretty great argument against them.It’s ironic, but it’s not new: More often than not, it’s the uber-progressives arguing for laws against “hate speech” -- despite the fact that they’re often the same people who are also arguing that Donald Trump and Republicans are constantly spewing it. Maybe it’s just me, but if I thought that the leader of my government was, you know, literally Hitler or whatever, the last thing that I’d want would be to give that person and their supporters control over my speech.Yes, the First Amendment gives us the right to be “offensive” with our speech. Given the fact that a new thing seems to be declared “racist” or “sexist” every day, I’m certainly glad that we do have this protection. After all, it would only take there being a few too many of the “super woke” in our government for a phrase like “you guys” to become a criminal offense.The truth is, though, the right to be “offensive” (however you define that subjective term, anyway) is not even the most important role that our First Amendment plays. No, what’s most important is that it protects our right to speak out against the government when we see fit -- without having to worry about its retaliation. Like it or not, the only way to ensure that we retain this important check on government power is to never (ever) give its leaders a vehicle take it away.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eTNessteMBpuBTcqmJGuYw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/bae9af12e23cce197b317b5c1be56053,"Former </>Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony"

Trump voiced concern over the 2018 capture but did not blame Moscow. Photograph: Mikhail Klimentyev/TassThe White House blocked the US state department from issuing a statement condemning Russia for seizing Ukrainian military vessels, according to a state department official, in the latest example of the strain the Trump administration is under in pursuing conflicting policies towards the two countries.The revelation on Wednesday came from Christopher Anderson, who was a senior aide to the special envoy on Ukraine, Kurt Volker, in November 2018, when Russia fired on and captured three Ukrainian vessels in the Sea of Azov off the Crimean peninsula.“While my colleagues at the state department quickly prepared a statement condemning Russia for its escalation, senior officials in the White House blocked it from being issued,” Anderson said in his prepared remarks to congressional committees holding impeachment hearings. “Ambassador Volker drafted a tweet condemning Russia’s actions, which I posted to his account.”In the face of silence from the White House, the then US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, condemned Russian behaviour, after which the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, followed suit. Trump voiced concern but did not blame Moscow.The 24 Ukrainian sailors detained in the operation were returned last month as part of a prisoner exchange.Anderson, and his successor in the Ukraine job, Catherine Croft, both testified to House committees on Wednesday about the role played by Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, in foiling state department efforts to bolster the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in the face of Russian military intervention in eastern Ukraine.In his testimony, Anderson quoted the former national security adviser, John Bolton, as saying: “Giuliani was a key voice with the president on Ukraine which could be an obstacle to increased White House engagement.” On Wednesday, the House committees asked Bolton to testify on 7 November, but it is unclear whether he will attend.Bolton’s former deputy, Charles Kupperman, is currently seeking a court ruling on whether to comply with his congressional subpoena in the face of a White House order not to testify.At the other side of Congress, the nominee to become ambassador to Russia, John Sullivan, faced pointed questions on Wednesday at confirmation hearings in the Senate about Giuliani and the split US policy towards Russia and Ukraine.Sullivan, currently the deputy secretary of state, said he was aware of Giuliani’s role in a campaign against the former US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. Asked if he knew Trump’s lawyer was “seeking to smear” Yovanovitch, he replied: “I believe he was, yes.”Sullivan confirmed he had been shown a dossier of material attacking Yovanovitch, saying it had provided by the White House to the state department legal adviser, but he was not aware it had been put together by Giuliani. He said the dossier “didn’t provide to me a basis for taking action against our ambassador”.He said that Pompeo gave Sullivan no explanation for the decision to recall Yovanovitch before the end of her posting, other than she had “lost the confidence of the president”.“As I understand, [Trump] may decide that he doesn’t like my testimony today and he doesn’t want me to go to Russia. The president can decide when he loses confidence in his ambassador – then that person is not going to continue as ambassador,” Sullivan said.Sullivan sought to avoid taking a position on the testimony by several former and current state department officials that the president, through Giuliani, had made a White House meeting and US military aid dependent on the Ukrainian government investigating Trump’s political rivals.“Soliciting investigations into a domestic political opponent – I don’t think that would be in accord with our values,” Sullivan said. But he would not confirm that was what the president had done.Democratic senators signaled that they were prepared to support Sullivan’s nomination as an experienced and respected diplomat, acknowledging the difficult position he was in. But they expressed concern he had not done more to find out what Trump and Giuliani were trying to achieve in Ukraine.The ranking Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee, Bob Menendez, told Sullivan he had been playing the role of “see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.”“You’re going to go to Russia, and you’re going to be saying one set of things based upon your testimony here,” Menendez said. “And we have the president who, in his public statements, is totally aligned differently than what you’re going to be saying.”“Do you understand the incredibly difficult job that you’re going to have as a result of that?” Menendez asked Sullivan.“I would say, senator, you’ve cited the president’s statements. I’d cite the president’s actions,” the nominee replied, listing sanctions the administration had imposed on Russia.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3dFxIoizaUY49lyZT_4bZQ--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/e71dc403755334597d5e870705964abd,"White House blocked effort to condemn Russia for seizing Ukraine ships, Congress told"

Circuit for the U.S. Court of Appeals on Tuesday night halted the scheduled release of grand-jury materials from Robert Mueller’s investigation, just hours ahead of the scheduled distribution.The decision came after a federal judge ruled last Friday that the Justice Department must release unredacted material from the original Mueller investigation, a move House Democrats have clamored for in the midst of the ongoing impeachment inquiry.Judge Beryl Howell, an Obama appointee, wrote that the committee “has shown that it needs the grand jury material referenced and cited in the Mueller Report to avoid a possible injustice in the impeachment inquiry.”The DOJ contested Howell’s ruling and issued an emergency appeal, saying a quick release “threatens an irreparable loss of grand-jury secrecy before this court even has a chance to act on the Department’s stay motion.” The government also noted that Howell gave no explanation for her seemingly arbitrary deadline of Wednesday, which was not offered by Democrats.The three-judge D.C. panel — made up of judges appointed by Barack Obama — decided on an administrative stay in order “to give the court sufficient opportunity to consider the emergency motion for stay pending appeal and should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits of that motion,” according to the decision.The debate centers around the validity of redactions to a grand-jury deposition, which is usually kept secret. The DOJ argues that materials in the report are squarely protected by federal evidence regulations, while others point to ongoing criminal matters involved, including a probe by Connecticut U.S attorney John Durham the origins of the investigation. House Democrats counter that secrecy rules do not apply to the impeachment inquiry, which is a judicial proceeding.",http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/w_heEZnk1hoDQSTVWqjVSg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/5cc14c5df368875c0317fc539bb227fd,D.C.

Meghan McCain Spars With Cory Booker Over Civility: Beto Was ‘Very Nasty’ to Me!,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:39:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/meghan-mccain-spars-cory-booker-163901660.html,"During a Wednesday interview with Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, The View’s Meghan McCain did what she apparently does best: Make the conversation about herself and, in this case, her personal beef with a presidential hopeful.After applauding Booker for saying Medicare for All is unrealistic, the conservative View co-host took issue with the New Jersey senator’s support for mandatory gun buybacks. This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he’s going to take her brother’s guns.After a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they’d continue the conversation in the next segment.“No we’re not,” McCain grumbled. “It’s fine.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

A staffer sitting behind her was captured on video as her eyes widened in shock.""You have demonstrated that you will pursue this heinous white supremacist ideology at all costs,"" said Wasserman Schultz. Cuccinelli answered that neither he nor the President was a white supremacist.""That's false,"" Cuccinelli said, calling Wasserman Schultz's statements ""defamatory.""Cuccinelli had been summoned to the hearing to discuss the Trump administration's decision to temporarily stop granting deportation deferments for illegal aliens receiving life-saving treatment in the U.S.Representative Ayanna Pressley (D., Ohio) also entered into a heated exchange with Cuccinelli over who was responsible for the decision, himself or White House officials. Cuccinelli repeatedly asserted that he made the decision and that no White House official was involved.Trump had considered appointing Cuccinelli secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. However, Senator Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) said the idea was a non-starter.“It’s my understanding that the existing law would not permit him to” lead the organization, Grassley said. “I don’t know how you get around that.” Grassley was referring to current laws that govern succession rules within the federal government.On Tuesday, a top Border Patrol official warned that illegal immigration could hit crisis levels if courts keep blocking Trump's immigration policies.""We will go back, mark the words, we will go back to the crisis level that we had before,"" said chief of law enforcement operations for the Border Patrol Brian Hastings.

"Former &lt;/&gt;Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:11:25 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/former-time-editor-wants-hate-211125098.html,"A former Time editor claimed that the United States needs a law banning hate speech, and that President Donald Trump “might be in violation of it” if there were one -- because, apparently, he doesn’t notice the irony of holding both of these views at once.In a Tuesday tweet promoting his Washington Post piece, titled “Why America needs a hate speech law,” Richard Stengel stated:> My @WashingtonPost piece on why the very broadness of the First Amendment suggests we should have a hate speech law. And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f> > -- Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019In the piece, Stengel writes that “many nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred” in the wake of World War II:> These laws started out as protections against the kinds of anti-Semitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws, but there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general, hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.“I’m all for protecting ‘thought that we hate,’ but not speech that incites hate,” he continues. “It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.”It’s interesting how Stengel actually does acknowledge the fact that “there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is,” and yet he still wants laws banning it. This makes absolutely no sense. After all, when he calls for laws to ban “hate speech,” he is, inherently, giving the government the power to decide what would and would not qualify -- the exact same government that is led by Donald Trump, and that is full of people who support him.In other words: Stengel somehow trusts that the government will have the same view of “hate speech” as he does, and then, in the same thought, seems to acknowledge that there’s actually no way that many of them would. Unless he thinks that the president and his congressional supporters would actually pass a law that they’d be in violation of, his argument for “hate speech” laws winds up being a pretty great argument against them.It’s ironic, but it’s not new: More often than not, it’s the uber-progressives arguing for laws against “hate speech” -- despite the fact that they’re often the same people who are also arguing that Donald Trump and Republicans are constantly spewing it. Maybe it’s just me, but if I thought that the leader of my government was, you know, literally Hitler or whatever, the last thing that I’d want would be to give that person and their supporters control over my speech.Yes, the First Amendment gives us the right to be “offensive” with our speech. Given the fact that a new thing seems to be declared “racist” or “sexist” every day, I’m certainly glad that we do have this protection. After all, it would only take there being a few too many of the “super woke” in our government for a phrase like “you guys” to become a criminal offense.The truth is, though, the right to be “offensive” (however you define that subjective term, anyway) is not even the most important role that our First Amendment plays. No, what’s most important is that it protects our right to speak out against the government when we see fit -- without having to worry about its retaliation. Like it or not, the only way to ensure that we retain this important check on government power is to never (ever) give its leaders a vehicle take it away.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eTNessteMBpuBTcqmJGuYw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/bae9af12e23cce197b317b5c1be56053,"Former </>Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony"

How did we get there?”After noting that he lives near one of the fires in the Los Angeles area, Rubin immediately took aim at liberal politics as the main reason the wildfires have grown so large and dangerous.“The problem right now is that everything, EVERYTHING, from academia to public utilities to politics, everything that goes woke, that buys into this ridiculous progressive ideology that cares about what contractors are LGBT or how many black firemen we have or white this or Asian that, everything that goes that road eventually breaks down,” he declared.As Carlson nodded and said “that’s true,” Rubin continued, complaining that this isn’t how “freedom is supposed to operate.”“What is supposed to happen—imagine if your house was on fire,” he added. “Would you care what the public utility or what the fire company, what contractor they brought in, what gender or sexuality or any of those things he or she was? It’s just absolutely ridiculous.”The Fox News host continued to agree with Rubin, who went on to tie PG&E;’s preemptive blackouts to a lack of “libertarian or conservative-minded people in California to fight what the progressives are doing to the state.”“If you can’t keep the lights on and you can’t keep the place from burning down, you’ve reached the point where there is no kind of lying about it anymore,” Carlson concluded. “It’s falling apart.

"More than 1,000 homeless people died in Los Angeles county last year","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 16:20:14 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/homeless-deaths-la-county-double-202014816.html,"The county’s public health department has reported 1,047 deaths for last year, a number that has increased steadily since 2013A woman pushes a cart full of her belongings past tents near Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles. Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty ImagesMore than 1,000 homeless people died in Los Angeles county in 2018, double the number of deaths from six years ago. The increase is a stark illustration of the region’s severe housing crisis, advocates said.The LA county public health department reported this week that 1,047 homeless people died last year, a number that has steadily increased every year since 2013, when 536 people died. The leading causes of death were coronary heart disease, which accounted for 22% of deaths, followed by alcohol and drug overdose at 21%, transportation-related injuries at 9%, homicides at 6% and suicides at 5%.The data sheds light on a worsening public health emergency in the county, where officials estimate there are now 59,000 people homeless, including more than 44,000 people who are living unsheltered – in cars, tents, or makeshift quarters. The report also follows a string of high-profile attacks against homeless people in the area, including the killing of Darrell Fields, a beloved musician who was burned to death in his tent on Skid Row.“We’ve got three people a day dying on the streets,” said Adam Rice, an organizer with Los Angeles Community Action Network (LA Can), a group that had worked closely with Fields. “It is a complete failure of leadership. Darrell didn’t need to die. None of these people needed to die. The reason this is happening is because there’s not proper housing.”Darrell Fields, 62, was a homeless man in Los Angeles known as Mr Guitar. He was killed in August when his tent was set ablaze. Photograph: Los Angeles Community Action NetworkSoaring rents and a major shortage of affordable housing have pushed people out of their homes in the area, with more than half of unsheltered adults in a recent count saying they were experiencing homelessness for the first time. The county estimated that there are now 8,800 homeless families.“It brings an overwhelming sadness when you think about precious human beings dying in our streets when it can be avoided,” said the Rev Andy Bales, CEO of Union Rescue Mission (URM), which runs a shelter at Skid Row, at the epicenter of the crisis in downtown LA.The county’s analysis also found that the mortality rate among homeless people has also jumped: “Put simply, being homeless in LA county is becoming increasingly deadly,” the agency wrote.The increase in overdoses represented the largest jump in terms of causes of death, the report found. In addition, the mortality rate among white homeless people has decreased while the rate of deaths for black and Latino residents has increased, the county said. Overall, African Americans are four times more likely to experience homelessness in LA county than other groups.Of the transportation-related deaths, which include vehicle and train collisions, 82% of victims were pedestrians and cyclists.The county and local clinics have increasingly sent healthcare workers to encampments to try to serve people on the streets. More than 21,000 homeless people were also placed in housing last year, an increase from 2017, officials reported early this year.The health department report this week recommended more direct outreach to homeless people, the creation of a “death review team” to study the subject and more traffic safety measures near encampments.Bales predicted that medical visits were not enough to reverse the deadly trends: “What we need most is for everyone to be immediately under a roof and protected from the elements. Until that happens, the death rates will continue to grow … and more and more people will be devastated by homelessness.”The crisis demanded a more urgent response, he added: “How much evidence do we need to gather before we decide not to let another human being die on the street?”LA’s homeless crisis has recently received national attention, with the Trump administration suggesting it could pursue some kind of law enforcement crackdown, drawing skepticism from some local organizations. Advocates have criticized efforts to further criminalize people living on the streets and have argued that the government needs to put more funding to housing and shelter.“It’s really a travesty when you think about it. How many deaths could’ve been prevented?” said Kourtney Milligan, a 29-year-old homeless woman, who has lived on Skid Row. “The resources that they say are out there are so hard to find.”",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/s2XrfBGfKBrVbz9mGlm7bg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/f15aa3ae803200f5d01035f9967bdb02,"More than 1,000 homeless people died in Los Angeles county last year"
"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:17:36 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/record-wave-lone-child-migrants-122133758.html,"TENOSIQUE, Mexico -- The United States has detained more children trying to cross the nation's southwest border on their own over the last year than during any other period on record, surpassing the surge of unaccompanied minors that set off a crisis during the Obama administration, according to new figures released Tuesday.U.S. immigration authorities apprehended 76,020 minors, most of them from Central America, traveling without their parents in the fiscal year that ended in September -- 52% more than during the last fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Mexico is experiencing the same surge. Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period -- pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.In interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous -- and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.""These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,"" Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters. ""And each month during the fiscal year, the numbers increased. You saw them. We all saw them.""The young migrants came alongside a historic wave of families traveling together, also largely from Central America. They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.Marvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced -- and he pressed on.""Quitting was not an option,"" Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. ""You wipe your tears and carry on.""For the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they'd kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.His parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said. ""We can't bear losing another son,"" they told him. ""You have to go.""He left home in the spring, with $40 in his pocket and no plan except to find work in a safer place.As for most underage migrants traveling without their parents, his trip north has been a feat of improvisation and courage. He walked and hitchhiked through Honduras and Guatemala. He slept in churches, under trees or wherever he found himself when night fell.Along the way, he gathered crucial bits of information from fellow migrants: the best route to take, locations of shelters up ahead, places to avoid, where to forage for food.As huge numbers of young migrants from Central America began arriving at the United States' southern border in 2014, the Obama administration scrambled to house them until they could be released to sponsors -- adults who applied to care for them. The shelter system grew dramatically as a result.The Trump administration experienced similar backups at the border just a few years later -- this time because of new, more stringent policies that made the sponsors themselves, who are often undocumented, vulnerable to immigration authorities. This discouraged people from coming forward, leaving thousands of children to languish in the system.The Trump administration has also sought to deter migration by separating thousands of children from their relatives, again driving up the number of children in federally contracted shelters.On the road, while trying to avoid detention, fear and hunger are constant companions for many young migrants.With little or no money in their pockets, they relied on strangers for snacks or meals. They pawed through garbage and scanned drifts of debris on the roadside, hoping to spot an edible morsel.Wilson, a 17-year-old Honduran, said he had feasted on rotten mangos discarded by street vendors.""I used to drink water from potholes when I was too thirsty,"" interjected Mario Leonel, 16, who left home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, several weeks ago without notifying his parents. ""That is the hardest part of it all: the hunger.""When he arrived at the shelter in Tenosique, a small Mexican town near the Guatemala border, he called his parents in Honduras, who burst into tears and pleaded for him to return. He said no. He was tired of all the violence in his country, and wanted to get asylum in the United States.After Marvel slipped across the Guatemala-Mexico border in May, he found room at a shelter in Tenosique, which serves as a transit point for many migrants. He quickly made new friends among other teenage migrants who had made it this far, mainly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador.On a recent afternoon, several of them gathered in a two-story building that had been reserved for minors, its walls painted with colorful animal murals. The boys cracked jokes, roughhoused and argued about who was the cutest girl in the shelter.Outside, Dulce, a 16-year-old transgender migrant from Guatemala, sat alone on train tracks pining for a boy she had met at the shelter. He had left without explanation and she was lovesick.""I just can't get him out of my mind,"" she said.She left her hometown four months earlier to escape abuse from her family and strangers, including a sexual assault by gang members when she was 12. She made it as far as central Mexico before being detained and deported. Five days after returning home, she set off again.""I left because I had nothing there and no one to protect me,"" she said. ""At least here I am safe.""Though the United States remains the destination of choice for most unaccompanied minors, an increasing number are setting their sights no farther than Mexico, advocates and migrants say.Sometimes they have no choice: Mexico's increased enforcement measures have made it more difficult for migrants to make it to the border with the United States. And even if they reach the United States, recent policies have drastically lowered the possibilities of getting asylum.In Mexico, when unaccompanied minors are detained, the law mandates that they be released right away into the custody of the national child protection agency, which finds them accommodation in shelters designed for children.But migrants' advocates say the government has been holding children in the nation's overcrowded detention centers for far too long, and that some children are quickly funneled into the deportation process rather than being given a fair chance to seek asylum or some other form of relief.""No child should ever be held at a detention center,"" said Elba Coria, a migration expert from the Clinic for Refugees at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City. ""But while international standards consider children's detention as an exceptional measure, amid Mexico's migration chaos, it is the rule.""Neither Marvel nor any of his new friends in the Tenosique shelter had been detained by the authorities. All had managed to cross into Mexico from Guatemala and had applied for asylum in Mexico after talking through their options with the shelter staff.They now plan to remain in Mexico and look for work and study opportunities -- even if they haven't abandoned hope of making it to the United States.""It is every Honduran's boy dream to get to the United States, where there is more money and kids are able to go to school,"" said Jose Angel, 17. He was born with a disability that left him unable to use his arms and left his hometown because his grandmother could no longer take care of him.He was hopeful he could apply for asylum in the United States despite Trump's many efforts to severely lower the number of people granted asylum. ""It is scary, but you have to take a chance,"" he said.On a recent morning, Alan, a 17-year-old Guatemalan migrant, sat on the sidewalk outside a migrant shelter in the city of Palenque, in southern Mexico. He had just crossed the border and was exhausted. Mexican immigration officials had stopped a bus he was on, but he managed to escape into the countryside and hide.Alan planned to take a nap, shower and have a meal before trying illegally to board a freight train known as The Beast. It runs from Mexico's border with Guatemala to its border with the United States and, for decades, migrants have clung to it to speed through much of Mexico.His hope was to make it to the U.S. border and petition for asylum. He was undeterred by Trump's recent efforts to restrict asylum claims or curb immigration.""One way or another, I have to make it to the other side where there are skyscrapers and life is better,"" he said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5ol82jExNHqBHa7IGzz2mw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/03f35d3f9d537a8dc9fe503d06c098de,"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation"

Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 10:05:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-warren-untenable-plans-140521979.html,"If you’ve been having trouble finding someone to walk your dog, don’t worry. Any day now, Elizabeth Warren will announce “a plan for that.” It will undoubtedly be comprehensive, detailed, and replete with subsidies for lower- and middle-class dog walkers and underserved breeds. It will cost tens of billions of dollars and will receive widespread positive notice from the media. However, to judge by her other recent plans, the one thing it won’t include is any discussion of how she plans to pay for it.The Massachusetts senator has challenged and possibly overtaken former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, largely based on having a plan for the government to tackle every problem facing this country, no matter how big or how small, from issues with military housing to Puerto Rican debt to climate change.The price tag for this massive expansion of government is enormous. Much of the attention in recent weeks has been focused on Warren’s embrace of Medicare for All, which she refuses to admit would require an increase in middle-class taxes. Even Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has conceded that such proposals, which would cost $30–40 trillion over 10 years, cannot be financed without tax hikes. Warren’s refusal to address this obvious fact makes her look less like a would-be policy wonk and more like a typical politician.But even setting aside Medicare for All, Warren’s plans are likely to dump oceans of red ink onto our growing national debt. Her non-health-care spending proposals already total some $7.5 trillion per year over the next 10 years. Although these are not quite Bernie levels of government largesse, her proposals would still require nearly double our current levels of spending.To pay for all this, Warren proposes a variety of tax hikes, mostly designed to hit corporations or high-earners: higher payroll taxes for those earning more than $250,000 per year; a 7 percent profits tax on companies earning more than $100 million; a 60 percent lobbying tax on firms that spend a million or more on lobbying, and so forth. But the biggest chunk of money would come from Warren’s proposed “wealth tax,” a 2 to 3 percent levy on net worth above $50 million. Warren estimates that this wealth tax will pull in more than $2.75 trillion over ten years. It won’t.First, there is the slight problem that a wealth tax is probably unconstitutional. Of course, constitutional constraints are quaint notions in the Age of Trump. Regardless, it is worth noting that the Constitution permits the federal government to impose only “direct taxes,” such as a property tax. That’s why it required a constitutional amendment to enact the federal income tax. Many constitutional scholars warn that a wealth tax is neither a direct tax nor income tax.Even if Warren can find a way around the constitutional guardrails -- perhaps by something such as a retrospective wealth tax in which you wait until a taxpayer sells assets or passes away -- a wealth tax is unlikely to raise anywhere near the amount of money she predicts.Simply look at Europe’s experiments with wealth taxes. At one time, a dozen European countries imposed wealth taxes. Today, all but three have abandoned those levies. Among those repealing their wealth tax are the Scandinavian social democracies that Warren admires, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Norway retains a wealth tax but has significantly reduced it in recent years. Additional countries abandoning the tax include Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Other countries, such as Great Britain, have considered wealth taxes and rejected them.They did so because wealth taxes are administratively complex and difficult to enforce. Also, they significantly reduce investment, entrepreneurship, and, ultimately, economic growth. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, European wealth taxes raised, on average, only about 0.2 percent of GDP in revenues. By comparison, the U.S. federal income tax raises 8 percent of GDP.Two groups, however, would benefit substantially from a wealth tax. The tax would be a full-employment opportunity for the tax-preparation industry and for lawyers. After all, we would now have to determine fair market value for everything from homes and vehicles to artwork and jewelry to family pension rights and intellectual property. The other big winner would be lobbyists, who could be expected to descend on Washington en masse seeking exemptions and exceptions for their clients. If you think the tax code is a mess today, just wait until D.C. is done with Warren’s plan.There is an old Yiddish proverb that goes “Mann tracht, un Gott Lacht,” or “Man plans, and God laughs.” It is all well and good that Senator Warren has a plan for everything. But until she actually figures out how to pay for everything without crippling our economy, such plans really don’t add up.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/t_XOfhQ2Q8pn0Eihbaza4g--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/710b4188b8e44ebd02c332c03dfb8d66,Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans
Meghan McCain Spars With Cory Booker Over Civility: Beto Was ‘Very Nasty’ to Me!,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:39:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/meghan-mccain-spars-cory-booker-163901660.html,"During a Wednesday interview with Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, The View’s Meghan McCain did what she apparently does best: Make the conversation about herself and, in this case, her personal beef with a presidential hopeful.After applauding Booker for saying Medicare for All is unrealistic, the conservative View co-host took issue with the New Jersey senator’s support for mandatory gun buybacks. This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he’s going to take her brother’s guns.After a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they’d continue the conversation in the next segment.“No we’re not,” McCain grumbled. “It’s fine.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Tucker Carlson and Guest Blame Diversity and ‘Woke’ Culture for California Fires,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 07:17:19 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/tucker-carlson-guest-blame-diversity-032855316.html,"Fox NewsFox News host Tucker Carlson and his guest, conservative YouTube personality Dave Rubin, both insisted Tuesday night that the wildfires burning across California are due largely to progressive ideology, “woke” culture, and diversity in hiring.During Tuesday’s broadcast of Tucker Carlson Tonight, Carlson welcomed on Rubin, a political commentator and podcaster, to discuss the issues surrounding the large fires engulfing the state, including those related to the electrical grid and firefighting methods.“PG&E; strikes me as almost a metaphor for the destruction of the state,” Carlson said about the state’s power company. “Here’s the utility which doesn’t really know anything about its own infrastructure but knows everything about the race of its employees. How did we get there?”After noting that he lives near one of the fires in the Los Angeles area, Rubin immediately took aim at liberal politics as the main reason the wildfires have grown so large and dangerous.“The problem right now is that everything, EVERYTHING, from academia to public utilities to politics, everything that goes woke, that buys into this ridiculous progressive ideology that cares about what contractors are LGBT or how many black firemen we have or white this or Asian that, everything that goes that road eventually breaks down,” he declared.As Carlson nodded and said “that’s true,” Rubin continued, complaining that this isn’t how “freedom is supposed to operate.”“What is supposed to happen—imagine if your house was on fire,” he added. “Would you care what the public utility or what the fire company, what contractor they brought in, what gender or sexuality or any of those things he or she was? It’s just absolutely ridiculous.”The Fox News host continued to agree with Rubin, who went on to tie PG&E;’s preemptive blackouts to a lack of “libertarian or conservative-minded people in California to fight what the progressives are doing to the state.”“If you can’t keep the lights on and you can’t keep the place from burning down, you’ve reached the point where there is no kind of lying about it anymore,” Carlson concluded. “It’s falling apart.

D.C. Panel Halts Release of Mueller Documents at DOJ’s Request,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 09:02:23 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/d-c-panel-halts-release-130223421.html,"The D.C. Circuit for the U.S. Court of Appeals on Tuesday night halted the scheduled release of grand-jury materials from Robert Mueller’s investigation, just hours ahead of the scheduled distribution.The decision came after a federal judge ruled last Friday that the Justice Department must release unredacted material from the original Mueller investigation, a move House Democrats have clamored for in the midst of the ongoing impeachment inquiry.Judge Beryl Howell, an Obama appointee, wrote that the committee “has shown that it needs the grand jury material referenced and cited in the Mueller Report to avoid a possible injustice in the impeachment inquiry.”The DOJ contested Howell’s ruling and issued an emergency appeal, saying a quick release “threatens an irreparable loss of grand-jury secrecy before this court even has a chance to act on the Department’s stay motion.” The government also noted that Howell gave no explanation for her seemingly arbitrary deadline of Wednesday, which was not offered by Democrats.The three-judge D.C. panel — made up of judges appointed by Barack Obama — decided on an administrative stay in order “to give the court sufficient opportunity to consider the emergency motion for stay pending appeal and should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits of that motion,” according to the decision.The debate centers around the validity of redactions to a grand-jury deposition, which is usually kept secret. The DOJ argues that materials in the report are squarely protected by federal evidence regulations, while others point to ongoing criminal matters involved, including a probe by Connecticut U.S attorney John Durham the origins of the investigation.

Al Gore Is Opening a New Front In the War On Climate Change,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 04:00:02 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/al-gore-makes-climate-case-080002432.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Al Gore’s 400-acre farm is located in Carthage, a small Tennessee town where the former vice president and senator traditionally kicked off his political campaigns. During his second act as a famous environmentalist, the farm became the site of a training program for aspiring climate activists, and more recently, an experiment in what Gore said is the world’s most realistic chance at averting climate catastrophe.Topsoil, the foot or so of ground underneath your feet, is responsible for almost all food production on Earth. It also stores more than three times as much carbon as forests. Today, agriculture is a net carbon emitter, contributing about 14% of all greenhouse gas emissions, but unlike power generation or automobiles, it can be turned into a net absorber, pulling carbon out of the atmosphere.If farming practices are changed through the use of cover crops, low-tilling and tree-planting, Gore said, agriculture conglomerates and family farmers alike could theoretically make their farms more productive while fighting global warming. Those changes can also replenish nutrients to the world’s soil, of which 33% has already been depleted.A virtuous circle if there ever was one—and one that’s already attracting attention from farmers, consumers and food companies.Gore, 71, is preaching the benefits of so-called carbon farming, a form of regenerative farming, at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump has been trying to roll back regulations meant to limit greenhouse gas emissions. And while science-based climate policy has been a prominent topic on the Democratic presidential campaign trail, it’s not always seen as a priority.Gore, who these days is more of a denim-wearing advocate than reserved technocrat, remains undeterred. His laboratory has been the farm where his parents once raised livestock and grew tobacco. Earlier this month, he invited 450 soil experts—farmers, scientists, chefs, food experts, entrepreneurs and investors—to join him there to discuss how to scale regenerative farming into something that might actually slow climate change.“We’ve waited so long to start to address the climate crisis,” Gore told those gathered. “We will need to both reduce emissions drastically and take as much carbon out of the atmosphere as we possibly can.”Unlike 2006, when Gore’s film “An Inconvenient Truth” was met with skepticism in some quarters, 13 years of intensifying storms, catastrophic floods and unprecedented droughts and wildfires have persuaded more Americans that there’s a very big problem. The goal now, Gore said, is to get people to start taking carbon farming seriously.When it comes to actually tackling what may soon become an existential crisis, the numbers are daunting. Trillions of dollars are needed to adapt civilization to the near-term consequences of climate change while tens of trillions of dollars are needed to slow its advance. But Gore said there are still too few plans to reverse global warming that don’t rely on technology that has yet to be developed.“Planting trees and sequestering carbon in soil are likely to remain the two most effective approaches,” Gore said in an interview at his Carthage farm. “There’s already some indication that farms that operate this way are more resilient in the face of climate extremes.”Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are at their highest in 3 million years. Oceans, the biggest carbon sinks of all, are acidifying because they hold too much of it. Plant life, which absorbs CO2 through photosynthesis, can sink carbon into the soil. Regenerative farming helps speed that along—with the added benefit of producing more nutrient-rich soil.Rattan Lal, a professor of soil physics and director of Ohio State University’s Carbon Management and Sequestration Center, is the key scientist behind Gore’s thinking. Lal served on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) when it shared a Nobel Prize with Gore in 2007, and was awarded the Japan Prize this year for his work on soil carbon sequestration.The world’s population currently uses more than a third of the planet’s surface for agriculture, according to the United Nations. In the U.S., close to 40% of land is farmland. Soil used for agriculture has degraded and eroded over centuries of use, losing between 20% and 60% of its original carbon content, according to the IPCC. Lal’s research shows that soil can sequester carbon at rates as high as 2.6 gigatons each year. An aggressive, global combination of tree planting and increased vegetation along with soil carbon sequestration, he said, has the “technical potential” to absorb 157 parts per million of CO2.With about 415 parts per million in the air today—a huge jump compared with a few decades ago—removing even a fraction of that could slow the advance of global warming.“There is virtually no analysis that shows the feasibility of doing any of this at scale.”Gore is realistic when it comes to the fraught politics of climate change and the policies that would need to align to make that potential possible. Moreover, carbon farming is a nascent concept in the U.S.: California has a growing program and Hawaii’s plan to become carbon neutral by 2045 includes a carbon farming framework. U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s “Green New Deal,” supported in some form by several Democratic presidential candidates, simply encourages farmers to improve soil health.But even without any legislation on the horizon, big agriculture is starting to pay attention.Eco-conscious shoppers are beginning to look for food farmed with regenerative practices, just as they do for organic products and sustainable packaging. General Mills set a goal in August to have 1 million acres in its supply chain transitioned to regenerative agriculture by 2030, and a group of companies including Danone North America and Unilever’s Ben & Jerry’s have been working on a certification for food farmed with regenerative practices.Not everyone is convinced its time has come, though. Timothy Searchinger, a research scholar at Princeton University who has studied the issue, said scalable carbon farming is still very much a pipe dream.“There is an unbelievable amount of scientific uncertainty,” Searchinger said. “There is virtually no analysis that shows the feasibility of doing any of this at scale.”Indeed, while there is some evidence that soil carbon can be rebuilt on degraded land, the technique requires putting so much nitrogen in the soil that the technique may not be viable in some places, he said. Additionally, many regenerative farmers discover that after a few years of no-till farming, their yields begin to fall. Searchinger said better options for achieving natural carbon sequestration at scale would be to focus on reducing deforestation and preserving peat lands.“It’s not the most useful thing to do in agriculture,” Searchinger said. While carbon farming would be helpful, he said the bigger agricultural climate issue is methane from livestock, something that might be addressed with feed additives.At its most basic, carbon farming is about leaving the ground alone. Simply plowing and tilling fields can disturb soil’s natural structure, releasing stored carbon into the atmosphere and displacing insects and microbes necessary for healthy soil. No-till farming creates fields that are better at acting like a sponge to absorb both water and carbon.Gore’s home state Tennessee leads the U.S. in no-till farming, with more than 78% of its farmland managed that way, versus 37% for the U.S., according to the Soil Health Institute. On his farm, some 10,000 trees have been planted to increase soil carbon. Small groups of cattle and sheep are rotated to graze in different areas, adding natural fertilizer to soils. The farm uses compost and cover crops to keep the soil healthy, rather than for their profit potential.Regenerative farming has more costs than traditional methods, especially upfront. Only about 108 million acres cross the U.S. are using some regenerative practices, according to Project Drawdown, a climate research group (as of 2012, the government said there were 914 million acres of farmland in America). The group estimates it would cost about $57 billion to convert another 1 billion acres by 2050, but that some 23.15 gigatons of CO2 could be sucked out of the atmosphere by doing so.While not a solution to the climate crisis by itself, Lal told the audience at Gore’s farm that regenerative farming could be, at the very least, “a bridge to the future.”Planting the same cash crops each year without rotating them tends to deplete nutrients from soil. Regenerative farming, meanwhile, results in more nutrient dense-crops. But most farmers don’t have any incentive to change what they are doing, because staples like wheat, rice, soybeans and corn are usually covered by federally-subsidized U.S. crop insurance—a $100 billion industry which currently guarantees that more than 290 million acres of U.S. farmland deliver returns for farmers regardless of the harvest.“For most people, this is a very new idea,” said Will Rodger, director of policy communications at the American Farm Bureau Federation. “We’re certainly aware that carbon can be stored in the soil, but farmers have very narrow margins.

"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:17:36 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/record-wave-lone-child-migrants-122133758.html,"TENOSIQUE, Mexico -- The United States has detained more children trying to cross the nation's southwest border on their own over the last year than during any other period on record, surpassing the surge of unaccompanied minors that set off a crisis during the Obama administration, according to new figures released Tuesday.U.S. immigration authorities apprehended 76,020 minors, most of them from Central America, traveling without their parents in the fiscal year that ended in September -- 52% more than during the last fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Mexico is experiencing the same surge. Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period -- pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.In interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous -- and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.""These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,"" Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters. ""And each month during the fiscal year, the numbers increased. You saw them. We all saw them.""The young migrants came alongside a historic wave of families traveling together, also largely from Central America. They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.Marvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced -- and he pressed on.""Quitting was not an option,"" Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. ""You wipe your tears and carry on.""For the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they'd kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.His parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said. ""We can't bear losing another son,"" they told him. ""You have to go.""He left home in the spring, with $40 in his pocket and no plan except to find work in a safer place.As for most underage migrants traveling without their parents, his trip north has been a feat of improvisation and courage. He walked and hitchhiked through Honduras and Guatemala. He slept in churches, under trees or wherever he found himself when night fell.Along the way, he gathered crucial bits of information from fellow migrants: the best route to take, locations of shelters up ahead, places to avoid, where to forage for food.As huge numbers of young migrants from Central America began arriving at the United States' southern border in 2014, the Obama administration scrambled to house them until they could be released to sponsors -- adults who applied to care for them. The shelter system grew dramatically as a result.The Trump administration experienced similar backups at the border just a few years later -- this time because of new, more stringent policies that made the sponsors themselves, who are often undocumented, vulnerable to immigration authorities. This discouraged people from coming forward, leaving thousands of children to languish in the system.The Trump administration has also sought to deter migration by separating thousands of children from their relatives, again driving up the number of children in federally contracted shelters.On the road, while trying to avoid detention, fear and hunger are constant companions for many young migrants.With little or no money in their pockets, they relied on strangers for snacks or meals. They pawed through garbage and scanned drifts of debris on the roadside, hoping to spot an edible morsel.Wilson, a 17-year-old Honduran, said he had feasted on rotten mangos discarded by street vendors.""I used to drink water from potholes when I was too thirsty,"" interjected Mario Leonel, 16, who left home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, several weeks ago without notifying his parents. ""That is the hardest part of it all: the hunger.""When he arrived at the shelter in Tenosique, a small Mexican town near the Guatemala border, he called his parents in Honduras, who burst into tears and pleaded for him to return. He said no. He was tired of all the violence in his country, and wanted to get asylum in the United States.After Marvel slipped across the Guatemala-Mexico border in May, he found room at a shelter in Tenosique, which serves as a transit point for many migrants. He quickly made new friends among other teenage migrants who had made it this far, mainly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador.On a recent afternoon, several of them gathered in a two-story building that had been reserved for minors, its walls painted with colorful animal murals. The boys cracked jokes, roughhoused and argued about who was the cutest girl in the shelter.Outside, Dulce, a 16-year-old transgender migrant from Guatemala, sat alone on train tracks pining for a boy she had met at the shelter. He had left without explanation and she was lovesick.""I just can't get him out of my mind,"" she said.She left her hometown four months earlier to escape abuse from her family and strangers, including a sexual assault by gang members when she was 12. She made it as far as central Mexico before being detained and deported. Five days after returning home, she set off again.""I left because I had nothing there and no one to protect me,"" she said. ""At least here I am safe.""Though the United States remains the destination of choice for most unaccompanied minors, an increasing number are setting their sights no farther than Mexico, advocates and migrants say.Sometimes they have no choice: Mexico's increased enforcement measures have made it more difficult for migrants to make it to the border with the United States. And even if they reach the United States, recent policies have drastically lowered the possibilities of getting asylum.In Mexico, when unaccompanied minors are detained, the law mandates that they be released right away into the custody of the national child protection agency, which finds them accommodation in shelters designed for children.But migrants' advocates say the government has been holding children in the nation's overcrowded detention centers for far too long, and that some children are quickly funneled into the deportation process rather than being given a fair chance to seek asylum or some other form of relief.""No child should ever be held at a detention center,"" said Elba Coria, a migration expert from the Clinic for Refugees at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City. ""But while international standards consider children's detention as an exceptional measure, amid Mexico's migration chaos, it is the rule.""Neither Marvel nor any of his new friends in the Tenosique shelter had been detained by the authorities. All had managed to cross into Mexico from Guatemala and had applied for asylum in Mexico after talking through their options with the shelter staff.They now plan to remain in Mexico and look for work and study opportunities -- even if they haven't abandoned hope of making it to the United States.""It is every Honduran's boy dream to get to the United States, where there is more money and kids are able to go to school,"" said Jose Angel, 17. He was born with a disability that left him unable to use his arms and left his hometown because his grandmother could no longer take care of him.He was hopeful he could apply for asylum in the United States despite Trump's many efforts to severely lower the number of people granted asylum. ""It is scary, but you have to take a chance,"" he said.On a recent morning, Alan, a 17-year-old Guatemalan migrant, sat on the sidewalk outside a migrant shelter in the city of Palenque, in southern Mexico. He had just crossed the border and was exhausted. Mexican immigration officials had stopped a bus he was on, but he managed to escape into the countryside and hide.Alan planned to take a nap, shower and have a meal before trying illegally to board a freight train known as The Beast. It runs from Mexico's border with Guatemala to its border with the United States and, for decades, migrants have clung to it to speed through much of Mexico.His hope was to make it to the U.S. border and petition for asylum. He was undeterred by Trump's recent efforts to restrict asylum claims or curb immigration.""One way or another, I have to make it to the other side where there are skyscrapers and life is better,"" he said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5ol82jExNHqBHa7IGzz2mw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/03f35d3f9d537a8dc9fe503d06c098de,"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation"

"Former &lt;/&gt;Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:11:25 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/former-time-editor-wants-hate-211125098.html,"A former Time editor claimed that the United States needs a law banning hate speech, and that President Donald Trump “might be in violation of it” if there were one -- because, apparently, he doesn’t notice the irony of holding both of these views at once.In a Tuesday tweet promoting his Washington Post piece, titled “Why America needs a hate speech law,” Richard Stengel stated:> My @WashingtonPost piece on why the very broadness of the First Amendment suggests we should have a hate speech law. And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f> > -- Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019In the piece, Stengel writes that “many nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred” in the wake of World War II:> These laws started out as protections against the kinds of anti-Semitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws, but there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general, hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.“I’m all for protecting ‘thought that we hate,’ but not speech that incites hate,” he continues. “It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.”It’s interesting how Stengel actually does acknowledge the fact that “there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is,” and yet he still wants laws banning it. This makes absolutely no sense. After all, when he calls for laws to ban “hate speech,” he is, inherently, giving the government the power to decide what would and would not qualify -- the exact same government that is led by Donald Trump, and that is full of people who support him.In other words: Stengel somehow trusts that the government will have the same view of “hate speech” as he does, and then, in the same thought, seems to acknowledge that there’s actually no way that many of them would. Unless he thinks that the president and his congressional supporters would actually pass a law that they’d be in violation of, his argument for “hate speech” laws winds up being a pretty great argument against them.It’s ironic, but it’s not new: More often than not, it’s the uber-progressives arguing for laws against “hate speech” -- despite the fact that they’re often the same people who are also arguing that Donald Trump and Republicans are constantly spewing it. Maybe it’s just me, but if I thought that the leader of my government was, you know, literally Hitler or whatever, the last thing that I’d want would be to give that person and their supporters control over my speech.Yes, the First Amendment gives us the right to be “offensive” with our speech. Given the fact that a new thing seems to be declared “racist” or “sexist” every day, I’m certainly glad that we do have this protection. After all, it would only take there being a few too many of the “super woke” in our government for a phrase like “you guys” to become a criminal offense.The truth is, though, the right to be “offensive” (however you define that subjective term, anyway) is not even the most important role that our First Amendment plays. No, what’s most important is that it protects our right to speak out against the government when we see fit -- without having to worry about its retaliation. Like it or not, the only way to ensure that we retain this important check on government power is to never (ever) give its leaders a vehicle take it away.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eTNessteMBpuBTcqmJGuYw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/bae9af12e23cce197b317b5c1be56053,"Former </>Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony"

Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 10:05:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-warren-untenable-plans-140521979.html,"If you’ve been having trouble finding someone to walk your dog, don’t worry. Any day now, Elizabeth Warren will announce “a plan for that.” It will undoubtedly be comprehensive, detailed, and replete with subsidies for lower- and middle-class dog walkers and underserved breeds. It will cost tens of billions of dollars and will receive widespread positive notice from the media. However, to judge by her other recent plans, the one thing it won’t include is any discussion of how she plans to pay for it.The Massachusetts senator has challenged and possibly overtaken former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, largely based on having a plan for the government to tackle every problem facing this country, no matter how big or how small, from issues with military housing to Puerto Rican debt to climate change.The price tag for this massive expansion of government is enormous. Much of the attention in recent weeks has been focused on Warren’s embrace of Medicare for All, which she refuses to admit would require an increase in middle-class taxes. Even Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has conceded that such proposals, which would cost $30–40 trillion over 10 years, cannot be financed without tax hikes. Warren’s refusal to address this obvious fact makes her look less like a would-be policy wonk and more like a typical politician.But even setting aside Medicare for All, Warren’s plans are likely to dump oceans of red ink onto our growing national debt. Her non-health-care spending proposals already total some $7.5 trillion per year over the next 10 years. Although these are not quite Bernie levels of government largesse, her proposals would still require nearly double our current levels of spending.To pay for all this, Warren proposes a variety of tax hikes, mostly designed to hit corporations or high-earners: higher payroll taxes for those earning more than $250,000 per year; a 7 percent profits tax on companies earning more than $100 million; a 60 percent lobbying tax on firms that spend a million or more on lobbying, and so forth. But the biggest chunk of money would come from Warren’s proposed “wealth tax,” a 2 to 3 percent levy on net worth above $50 million. Warren estimates that this wealth tax will pull in more than $2.75 trillion over ten years. It won’t.First, there is the slight problem that a wealth tax is probably unconstitutional. Of course, constitutional constraints are quaint notions in the Age of Trump. Regardless, it is worth noting that the Constitution permits the federal government to impose only “direct taxes,” such as a property tax. That’s why it required a constitutional amendment to enact the federal income tax. Many constitutional scholars warn that a wealth tax is neither a direct tax nor income tax.Even if Warren can find a way around the constitutional guardrails -- perhaps by something such as a retrospective wealth tax in which you wait until a taxpayer sells assets or passes away -- a wealth tax is unlikely to raise anywhere near the amount of money she predicts.Simply look at Europe’s experiments with wealth taxes. At one time, a dozen European countries imposed wealth taxes. Today, all but three have abandoned those levies. Among those repealing their wealth tax are the Scandinavian social democracies that Warren admires, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Norway retains a wealth tax but has significantly reduced it in recent years. Additional countries abandoning the tax include Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Other countries, such as Great Britain, have considered wealth taxes and rejected them.They did so because wealth taxes are administratively complex and difficult to enforce. Also, they significantly reduce investment, entrepreneurship, and, ultimately, economic growth. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, European wealth taxes raised, on average, only about 0.2 percent of GDP in revenues. By comparison, the U.S. federal income tax raises 8 percent of GDP.Two groups, however, would benefit substantially from a wealth tax. The tax would be a full-employment opportunity for the tax-preparation industry and for lawyers. After all, we would now have to determine fair market value for everything from homes and vehicles to artwork and jewelry to family pension rights and intellectual property. The other big winner would be lobbyists, who could be expected to descend on Washington en masse seeking exemptions and exceptions for their clients. If you think the tax code is a mess today, just wait until D.C. is done with Warren’s plan.There is an old Yiddish proverb that goes “Mann tracht, un Gott Lacht,” or “Man plans, and God laughs.” It is all well and good that Senator Warren has a plan for everything. But until she actually figures out how to pay for everything without crippling our economy, such plans really don’t add up.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/t_XOfhQ2Q8pn0Eihbaza4g--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/710b4188b8e44ebd02c332c03dfb8d66,Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans
Meghan McCain Spars With Cory Booker Over Civility: Beto Was ‘Very Nasty’ to Me!,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:39:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/meghan-mccain-spars-cory-booker-163901660.html,"During a Wednesday interview with Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, The View’s Meghan McCain did what she apparently does best: Make the conversation about herself and, in this case, her personal beef with a presidential hopeful.After applauding Booker for saying Medicare for All is unrealistic, the conservative View co-host took issue with the New Jersey senator’s support for mandatory gun buybacks. This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he’s going to take her brother’s guns.After a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they’d continue the conversation in the next segment.“No we’re not,” McCain grumbled. “It’s fine.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Tucker Carlson and Guest Blame Diversity and ‘Woke’ Culture for California Fires,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 07:17:19 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/tucker-carlson-guest-blame-diversity-032855316.html,"Fox NewsFox News host Tucker Carlson and his guest, conservative YouTube personality Dave Rubin, both insisted Tuesday night that the wildfires burning across California are due largely to progressive ideology, “woke” culture, and diversity in hiring.During Tuesday’s broadcast of Tucker Carlson Tonight, Carlson welcomed on Rubin, a political commentator and podcaster, to discuss the issues surrounding the large fires engulfing the state, including those related to the electrical grid and firefighting methods.“PG&E; strikes me as almost a metaphor for the destruction of the state,” Carlson said about the state’s power company. “Here’s the utility which doesn’t really know anything about its own infrastructure but knows everything about the race of its employees. How did we get there?”After noting that he lives near one of the fires in the Los Angeles area, Rubin immediately took aim at liberal politics as the main reason the wildfires have grown so large and dangerous.“The problem right now is that everything, EVERYTHING, from academia to public utilities to politics, everything that goes woke, that buys into this ridiculous progressive ideology that cares about what contractors are LGBT or how many black firemen we have or white this or Asian that, everything that goes that road eventually breaks down,” he declared.As Carlson nodded and said “that’s true,” Rubin continued, complaining that this isn’t how “freedom is supposed to operate.”“What is supposed to happen—imagine if your house was on fire,” he added. “Would you care what the public utility or what the fire company, what contractor they brought in, what gender or sexuality or any of those things he or she was? It’s just absolutely ridiculous.”The Fox News host continued to agree with Rubin, who went on to tie PG&E;’s preemptive blackouts to a lack of “libertarian or conservative-minded people in California to fight what the progressives are doing to the state.”“If you can’t keep the lights on and you can’t keep the place from burning down, you’ve reached the point where there is no kind of lying about it anymore,” Carlson concluded. “It’s falling apart.

Circuit for the U.S. Court of Appeals on Tuesday night halted the scheduled release of grand-jury materials from Robert Mueller’s investigation, just hours ahead of the scheduled distribution.The decision came after a federal judge ruled last Friday that the Justice Department must release unredacted material from the original Mueller investigation, a move House Democrats have clamored for in the midst of the ongoing impeachment inquiry.Judge Beryl Howell, an Obama appointee, wrote that the committee “has shown that it needs the grand jury material referenced and cited in the Mueller Report to avoid a possible injustice in the impeachment inquiry.”The DOJ contested Howell’s ruling and issued an emergency appeal, saying a quick release “threatens an irreparable loss of grand-jury secrecy before this court even has a chance to act on the Department’s stay motion.” The government also noted that Howell gave no explanation for her seemingly arbitrary deadline of Wednesday, which was not offered by Democrats.The three-judge D.C. panel — made up of judges appointed by Barack Obama — decided on an administrative stay in order “to give the court sufficient opportunity to consider the emergency motion for stay pending appeal and should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits of that motion,” according to the decision.The debate centers around the validity of redactions to a grand-jury deposition, which is usually kept secret. The DOJ argues that materials in the report are squarely protected by federal evidence regulations, while others point to ongoing criminal matters involved, including a probe by Connecticut U.S attorney John Durham the origins of the investigation.

Al Gore Is Opening a New Front In the War On Climate Change,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 04:00:02 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/al-gore-makes-climate-case-080002432.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Al Gore’s 400-acre farm is located in Carthage, a small Tennessee town where the former vice president and senator traditionally kicked off his political campaigns. During his second act as a famous environmentalist, the farm became the site of a training program for aspiring climate activists, and more recently, an experiment in what Gore said is the world’s most realistic chance at averting climate catastrophe.Topsoil, the foot or so of ground underneath your feet, is responsible for almost all food production on Earth. It also stores more than three times as much carbon as forests. Today, agriculture is a net carbon emitter, contributing about 14% of all greenhouse gas emissions, but unlike power generation or automobiles, it can be turned into a net absorber, pulling carbon out of the atmosphere.If farming practices are changed through the use of cover crops, low-tilling and tree-planting, Gore said, agriculture conglomerates and family farmers alike could theoretically make their farms more productive while fighting global warming. Those changes can also replenish nutrients to the world’s soil, of which 33% has already been depleted.A virtuous circle if there ever was one—and one that’s already attracting attention from farmers, consumers and food companies.Gore, 71, is preaching the benefits of so-called carbon farming, a form of regenerative farming, at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump has been trying to roll back regulations meant to limit greenhouse gas emissions. And while science-based climate policy has been a prominent topic on the Democratic presidential campaign trail, it’s not always seen as a priority.Gore, who these days is more of a denim-wearing advocate than reserved technocrat, remains undeterred. His laboratory has been the farm where his parents once raised livestock and grew tobacco. Earlier this month, he invited 450 soil experts—farmers, scientists, chefs, food experts, entrepreneurs and investors—to join him there to discuss how to scale regenerative farming into something that might actually slow climate change.“We’ve waited so long to start to address the climate crisis,” Gore told those gathered. “We will need to both reduce emissions drastically and take as much carbon out of the atmosphere as we possibly can.”Unlike 2006, when Gore’s film “An Inconvenient Truth” was met with skepticism in some quarters, 13 years of intensifying storms, catastrophic floods and unprecedented droughts and wildfires have persuaded more Americans that there’s a very big problem. The goal now, Gore said, is to get people to start taking carbon farming seriously.When it comes to actually tackling what may soon become an existential crisis, the numbers are daunting. Trillions of dollars are needed to adapt civilization to the near-term consequences of climate change while tens of trillions of dollars are needed to slow its advance. But Gore said there are still too few plans to reverse global warming that don’t rely on technology that has yet to be developed.“Planting trees and sequestering carbon in soil are likely to remain the two most effective approaches,” Gore said in an interview at his Carthage farm. “There’s already some indication that farms that operate this way are more resilient in the face of climate extremes.”Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are at their highest in 3 million years. Oceans, the biggest carbon sinks of all, are acidifying because they hold too much of it. Plant life, which absorbs CO2 through photosynthesis, can sink carbon into the soil. Regenerative farming helps speed that along—with the added benefit of producing more nutrient-rich soil.Rattan Lal, a professor of soil physics and director of Ohio State University’s Carbon Management and Sequestration Center, is the key scientist behind Gore’s thinking. Lal served on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) when it shared a Nobel Prize with Gore in 2007, and was awarded the Japan Prize this year for his work on soil carbon sequestration.The world’s population currently uses more than a third of the planet’s surface for agriculture, according to the United Nations. In the U.S., close to 40% of land is farmland. Soil used for agriculture has degraded and eroded over centuries of use, losing between 20% and 60% of its original carbon content, according to the IPCC. Lal’s research shows that soil can sequester carbon at rates as high as 2.6 gigatons each year. An aggressive, global combination of tree planting and increased vegetation along with soil carbon sequestration, he said, has the “technical potential” to absorb 157 parts per million of CO2.With about 415 parts per million in the air today—a huge jump compared with a few decades ago—removing even a fraction of that could slow the advance of global warming.“There is virtually no analysis that shows the feasibility of doing any of this at scale.”Gore is realistic when it comes to the fraught politics of climate change and the policies that would need to align to make that potential possible. Moreover, carbon farming is a nascent concept in the U.S.: California has a growing program and Hawaii’s plan to become carbon neutral by 2045 includes a carbon farming framework. U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s “Green New Deal,” supported in some form by several Democratic presidential candidates, simply encourages farmers to improve soil health.But even without any legislation on the horizon, big agriculture is starting to pay attention.Eco-conscious shoppers are beginning to look for food farmed with regenerative practices, just as they do for organic products and sustainable packaging. General Mills set a goal in August to have 1 million acres in its supply chain transitioned to regenerative agriculture by 2030, and a group of companies including Danone North America and Unilever’s Ben & Jerry’s have been working on a certification for food farmed with regenerative practices.Not everyone is convinced its time has come, though. Timothy Searchinger, a research scholar at Princeton University who has studied the issue, said scalable carbon farming is still very much a pipe dream.“There is an unbelievable amount of scientific uncertainty,” Searchinger said. “There is virtually no analysis that shows the feasibility of doing any of this at scale.”Indeed, while there is some evidence that soil carbon can be rebuilt on degraded land, the technique requires putting so much nitrogen in the soil that the technique may not be viable in some places, he said. Additionally, many regenerative farmers discover that after a few years of no-till farming, their yields begin to fall. Searchinger said better options for achieving natural carbon sequestration at scale would be to focus on reducing deforestation and preserving peat lands.“It’s not the most useful thing to do in agriculture,” Searchinger said. While carbon farming would be helpful, he said the bigger agricultural climate issue is methane from livestock, something that might be addressed with feed additives.At its most basic, carbon farming is about leaving the ground alone. Simply plowing and tilling fields can disturb soil’s natural structure, releasing stored carbon into the atmosphere and displacing insects and microbes necessary for healthy soil. No-till farming creates fields that are better at acting like a sponge to absorb both water and carbon.Gore’s home state Tennessee leads the U.S. in no-till farming, with more than 78% of its farmland managed that way, versus 37% for the U.S., according to the Soil Health Institute. On his farm, some 10,000 trees have been planted to increase soil carbon. Small groups of cattle and sheep are rotated to graze in different areas, adding natural fertilizer to soils. The farm uses compost and cover crops to keep the soil healthy, rather than for their profit potential.Regenerative farming has more costs than traditional methods, especially upfront. Only about 108 million acres cross the U.S. are using some regenerative practices, according to Project Drawdown, a climate research group (as of 2012, the government said there were 914 million acres of farmland in America). The group estimates it would cost about $57 billion to convert another 1 billion acres by 2050, but that some 23.15 gigatons of CO2 could be sucked out of the atmosphere by doing so.While not a solution to the climate crisis by itself, Lal told the audience at Gore’s farm that regenerative farming could be, at the very least, “a bridge to the future.”Planting the same cash crops each year without rotating them tends to deplete nutrients from soil. Regenerative farming, meanwhile, results in more nutrient dense-crops. But most farmers don’t have any incentive to change what they are doing, because staples like wheat, rice, soybeans and corn are usually covered by federally-subsidized U.S. crop insurance—a $100 billion industry which currently guarantees that more than 290 million acres of U.S. farmland deliver returns for farmers regardless of the harvest.“For most people, this is a very new idea,” said Will Rodger, director of policy communications at the American Farm Bureau Federation. “We’re certainly aware that carbon can be stored in the soil, but farmers have very narrow margins. Many of our members are looking very closely at it, but the question is how to make it a business.”The U.S. Farmers & Ranchers Alliance proposed earlier this year that lenders find more creative financing models to help farmers employ regenerative practices. A study published this month in Nature Climate Change found that deploying land sector strategies like carbon farming, as well as food waste reduction and increasing plant-based diets, could turn farming into a net absorber of carbon as soon as 2050.Gore predicts that popular adoption of regenerative farming will someday take hold the same way residential solar and electric vehicles have caught on. “Farmers are doing this because they think it’s better for them,” Gore said. “I look for signs of hope.”To contact the author of this story: Emily Chasan in New York at echasan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: David Rovella at drovella@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fZi_K4S7kgMEpAkFCdczMg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/2f9b9b938ffcd69bb8fc199a89eedafd,Al Gore Is Opening a New Front In the War On Climate Change

Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period -- pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.In interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous -- and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.""These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,"" Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters. ""And each month during the fiscal year, the numbers increased. You saw them.

They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.Marvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced -- and he pressed on.""Quitting was not an option,"" Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. ""You wipe your tears and carry on.""For the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they'd kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.His parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said. ""We can't bear losing another son,"" they told him. ""You have to go.""He left home in the spring, with $40 in his pocket and no plan except to find work in a safer place.As for most underage migrants traveling without their parents, his trip north has been a feat of improvisation and courage. He walked and hitchhiked through Honduras and Guatemala. He slept in churches, under trees or wherever he found himself when night fell.Along the way, he gathered crucial bits of information from fellow migrants: the best route to take, locations of shelters up ahead, places to avoid, where to forage for food.As huge numbers of young migrants from Central America began arriving at the United States' southern border in 2014, the Obama administration scrambled to house them until they could be released to sponsors -- adults who applied to care for them. The shelter system grew dramatically as a result.The Trump administration experienced similar backups at the border just a few years later -- this time because of new, more stringent policies that made the sponsors themselves, who are often undocumented, vulnerable to immigration authorities. This discouraged people from coming forward, leaving thousands of children to languish in the system.The Trump administration has also sought to deter migration by separating thousands of children from their relatives, again driving up the number of children in federally contracted shelters.On the road, while trying to avoid detention, fear and hunger are constant companions for many young migrants.With little or no money in their pockets, they relied on strangers for snacks or meals. They pawed through garbage and scanned drifts of debris on the roadside, hoping to spot an edible morsel.Wilson, a 17-year-old Honduran, said he had feasted on rotten mangos discarded by street vendors.""I used to drink water from potholes when I was too thirsty,"" interjected Mario Leonel, 16, who left home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, several weeks ago without notifying his parents. ""That is the hardest part of it all: the hunger.""When he arrived at the shelter in Tenosique, a small Mexican town near the Guatemala border, he called his parents in Honduras, who burst into tears and pleaded for him to return. He said no. He was tired of all the violence in his country, and wanted to get asylum in the United States.After Marvel slipped across the Guatemala-Mexico border in May, he found room at a shelter in Tenosique, which serves as a transit point for many migrants. He quickly made new friends among other teenage migrants who had made it this far, mainly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador.On a recent afternoon, several of them gathered in a two-story building that had been reserved for minors, its walls painted with colorful animal murals. The boys cracked jokes, roughhoused and argued about who was the cutest girl in the shelter.Outside, Dulce, a 16-year-old transgender migrant from Guatemala, sat alone on train tracks pining for a boy she had met at the shelter. He had left without explanation and she was lovesick.""I just can't get him out of my mind,"" she said.She left her hometown four months earlier to escape abuse from her family and strangers, including a sexual assault by gang members when she was 12. She made it as far as central Mexico before being detained and deported. Five days after returning home, she set off again.""I left because I had nothing there and no one to protect me,"" she said. ""At least here I am safe.""Though the United States remains the destination of choice for most unaccompanied minors, an increasing number are setting their sights no farther than Mexico, advocates and migrants say.Sometimes they have no choice: Mexico's increased enforcement measures have made it more difficult for migrants to make it to the border with the United States. And even if they reach the United States, recent policies have drastically lowered the possibilities of getting asylum.In Mexico, when unaccompanied minors are detained, the law mandates that they be released right away into the custody of the national child protection agency, which finds them accommodation in shelters designed for children.But migrants' advocates say the government has been holding children in the nation's overcrowded detention centers for far too long, and that some children are quickly funneled into the deportation process rather than being given a fair chance to seek asylum or some other form of relief.""No child should ever be held at a detention center,"" said Elba Coria, a migration expert from the Clinic for Refugees at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City. ""But while international standards consider children's detention as an exceptional measure, amid Mexico's migration chaos, it is the rule.""Neither Marvel nor any of his new friends in the Tenosique shelter had been detained by the authorities. All had managed to cross into Mexico from Guatemala and had applied for asylum in Mexico after talking through their options with the shelter staff.They now plan to remain in Mexico and look for work and study opportunities -- even if they haven't abandoned hope of making it to the United States.""It is every Honduran's boy dream to get to the United States, where there is more money and kids are able to go to school,"" said Jose Angel, 17. He was born with a disability that left him unable to use his arms and left his hometown because his grandmother could no longer take care of him.He was hopeful he could apply for asylum in the United States despite Trump's many efforts to severely lower the number of people granted asylum. ""It is scary, but you have to take a chance,"" he said.On a recent morning, Alan, a 17-year-old Guatemalan migrant, sat on the sidewalk outside a migrant shelter in the city of Palenque, in southern Mexico. He had just crossed the border and was exhausted. Mexican immigration officials had stopped a bus he was on, but he managed to escape into the countryside and hide.Alan planned to take a nap, shower and have a meal before trying illegally to board a freight train known as The Beast. It runs from Mexico's border with Guatemala to its border with the United States and, for decades, migrants have clung to it to speed through much of Mexico.His hope was to make it to the U.S. border and petition for asylum. He was undeterred by Trump's recent efforts to restrict asylum claims or curb immigration.""One way or another, I have to make it to the other side where there are skyscrapers and life is better,"" he said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5ol82jExNHqBHa7IGzz2mw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/03f35d3f9d537a8dc9fe503d06c098de,"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation"

"Former &lt;/&gt;Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:11:25 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/former-time-editor-wants-hate-211125098.html,"A former Time editor claimed that the United States needs a law banning hate speech, and that President Donald Trump “might be in violation of it” if there were one -- because, apparently, he doesn’t notice the irony of holding both of these views at once.In a Tuesday tweet promoting his Washington Post piece, titled “Why America needs a hate speech law,” Richard Stengel stated:> My @WashingtonPost piece on why the very broadness of the First Amendment suggests we should have a hate speech law. And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f> > -- Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019In the piece, Stengel writes that “many nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred” in the wake of World War II:> These laws started out as protections against the kinds of anti-Semitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws, but there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general, hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.“I’m all for protecting ‘thought that we hate,’ but not speech that incites hate,” he continues. “It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.”It’s interesting how Stengel actually does acknowledge the fact that “there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is,” and yet he still wants laws banning it. This makes absolutely no sense. After all, when he calls for laws to ban “hate speech,” he is, inherently, giving the government the power to decide what would and would not qualify -- the exact same government that is led by Donald Trump, and that is full of people who support him.In other words: Stengel somehow trusts that the government will have the same view of “hate speech” as he does, and then, in the same thought, seems to acknowledge that there’s actually no way that many of them would. Unless he thinks that the president and his congressional supporters would actually pass a law that they’d be in violation of, his argument for “hate speech” laws winds up being a pretty great argument against them.It’s ironic, but it’s not new: More often than not, it’s the uber-progressives arguing for laws against “hate speech” -- despite the fact that they’re often the same people who are also arguing that Donald Trump and Republicans are constantly spewing it. Maybe it’s just me, but if I thought that the leader of my government was, you know, literally Hitler or whatever, the last thing that I’d want would be to give that person and their supporters control over my speech.Yes, the First Amendment gives us the right to be “offensive” with our speech. Given the fact that a new thing seems to be declared “racist” or “sexist” every day, I’m certainly glad that we do have this protection. After all, it would only take there being a few too many of the “super woke” in our government for a phrase like “you guys” to become a criminal offense.The truth is, though, the right to be “offensive” (however you define that subjective term, anyway) is not even the most important role that our First Amendment plays. No, what’s most important is that it protects our right to speak out against the government when we see fit -- without having to worry about its retaliation. Like it or not, the only way to ensure that we retain this important check on government power is to never (ever) give its leaders a vehicle take it away.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eTNessteMBpuBTcqmJGuYw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/bae9af12e23cce197b317b5c1be56053,"Former </>Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony"

Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 10:05:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-warren-untenable-plans-140521979.html,"If you’ve been having trouble finding someone to walk your dog, don’t worry. Any day now, Elizabeth Warren will announce “a plan for that.” It will undoubtedly be comprehensive, detailed, and replete with subsidies for lower- and middle-class dog walkers and underserved breeds. It will cost tens of billions of dollars and will receive widespread positive notice from the media. However, to judge by her other recent plans, the one thing it won’t include is any discussion of how she plans to pay for it.The Massachusetts senator has challenged and possibly overtaken former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, largely based on having a plan for the government to tackle every problem facing this country, no matter how big or how small, from issues with military housing to Puerto Rican debt to climate change.The price tag for this massive expansion of government is enormous. Much of the attention in recent weeks has been focused on Warren’s embrace of Medicare for All, which she refuses to admit would require an increase in middle-class taxes. Even Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has conceded that such proposals, which would cost $30–40 trillion over 10 years, cannot be financed without tax hikes. Warren’s refusal to address this obvious fact makes her look less like a would-be policy wonk and more like a typical politician.But even setting aside Medicare for All, Warren’s plans are likely to dump oceans of red ink onto our growing national debt. Her non-health-care spending proposals already total some $7.5 trillion per year over the next 10 years. Although these are not quite Bernie levels of government largesse, her proposals would still require nearly double our current levels of spending.To pay for all this, Warren proposes a variety of tax hikes, mostly designed to hit corporations or high-earners: higher payroll taxes for those earning more than $250,000 per year; a 7 percent profits tax on companies earning more than $100 million; a 60 percent lobbying tax on firms that spend a million or more on lobbying, and so forth. But the biggest chunk of money would come from Warren’s proposed “wealth tax,” a 2 to 3 percent levy on net worth above $50 million. Warren estimates that this wealth tax will pull in more than $2.75 trillion over ten years. It won’t.First, there is the slight problem that a wealth tax is probably unconstitutional. Of course, constitutional constraints are quaint notions in the Age of Trump. Regardless, it is worth noting that the Constitution permits the federal government to impose only “direct taxes,” such as a property tax. That’s why it required a constitutional amendment to enact the federal income tax. Many constitutional scholars warn that a wealth tax is neither a direct tax nor income tax.Even if Warren can find a way around the constitutional guardrails -- perhaps by something such as a retrospective wealth tax in which you wait until a taxpayer sells assets or passes away -- a wealth tax is unlikely to raise anywhere near the amount of money she predicts.Simply look at Europe’s experiments with wealth taxes. At one time, a dozen European countries imposed wealth taxes. Today, all but three have abandoned those levies. Among those repealing their wealth tax are the Scandinavian social democracies that Warren admires, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Norway retains a wealth tax but has significantly reduced it in recent years. Additional countries abandoning the tax include Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Other countries, such as Great Britain, have considered wealth taxes and rejected them.They did so because wealth taxes are administratively complex and difficult to enforce. Also, they significantly reduce investment, entrepreneurship, and, ultimately, economic growth. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, European wealth taxes raised, on average, only about 0.2 percent of GDP in revenues. By comparison, the U.S. federal income tax raises 8 percent of GDP.Two groups, however, would benefit substantially from a wealth tax. The tax would be a full-employment opportunity for the tax-preparation industry and for lawyers. After all, we would now have to determine fair market value for everything from homes and vehicles to artwork and jewelry to family pension rights and intellectual property. The other big winner would be lobbyists, who could be expected to descend on Washington en masse seeking exemptions and exceptions for their clients. If you think the tax code is a mess today, just wait until D.C. is done with Warren’s plan.There is an old Yiddish proverb that goes “Mann tracht, un Gott Lacht,” or “Man plans, and God laughs.” It is all well and good that Senator Warren has a plan for everything. But until she actually figures out how to pay for everything without crippling our economy, such plans really don’t add up.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/t_XOfhQ2Q8pn0Eihbaza4g--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/710b4188b8e44ebd02c332c03dfb8d66,Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans
Meghan McCain Spars With Cory Booker Over Civility: Beto Was ‘Very Nasty’ to Me!,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:39:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/meghan-mccain-spars-cory-booker-163901660.html,"During a Wednesday interview with Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, The View’s Meghan McCain did what she apparently does best: Make the conversation about herself and, in this case, her personal beef with a presidential hopeful.After applauding Booker for saying Medicare for All is unrealistic, the conservative View co-host took issue with the New Jersey senator’s support for mandatory gun buybacks. This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he’s going to take her brother’s guns.After a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they’d continue the conversation in the next segment.“No we’re not,” McCain grumbled. “It’s fine.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Tucker Carlson and Guest Blame Diversity and ‘Woke’ Culture for California Fires,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 07:17:19 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/tucker-carlson-guest-blame-diversity-032855316.html,"Fox NewsFox News host Tucker Carlson and his guest, conservative YouTube personality Dave Rubin, both insisted Tuesday night that the wildfires burning across California are due largely to progressive ideology, “woke” culture, and diversity in hiring.During Tuesday’s broadcast of Tucker Carlson Tonight, Carlson welcomed on Rubin, a political commentator and podcaster, to discuss the issues surrounding the large fires engulfing the state, including those related to the electrical grid and firefighting methods.“PG&E; strikes me as almost a metaphor for the destruction of the state,” Carlson said about the state’s power company. “Here’s the utility which doesn’t really know anything about its own infrastructure but knows everything about the race of its employees. How did we get there?”After noting that he lives near one of the fires in the Los Angeles area, Rubin immediately took aim at liberal politics as the main reason the wildfires have grown so large and dangerous.“The problem right now is that everything, EVERYTHING, from academia to public utilities to politics, everything that goes woke, that buys into this ridiculous progressive ideology that cares about what contractors are LGBT or how many black firemen we have or white this or Asian that, everything that goes that road eventually breaks down,” he declared.As Carlson nodded and said “that’s true,” Rubin continued, complaining that this isn’t how “freedom is supposed to operate.”“What is supposed to happen—imagine if your house was on fire,” he added. “Would you care what the public utility or what the fire company, what contractor they brought in, what gender or sexuality or any of those things he or she was? It’s just absolutely ridiculous.”The Fox News host continued to agree with Rubin, who went on to tie PG&E;’s preemptive blackouts to a lack of “libertarian or conservative-minded people in California to fight what the progressives are doing to the state.”“If you can’t keep the lights on and you can’t keep the place from burning down, you’ve reached the point where there is no kind of lying about it anymore,” Carlson concluded. “It’s falling apart.

Circuit for the U.S. Court of Appeals on Tuesday night halted the scheduled release of grand-jury materials from Robert Mueller’s investigation, just hours ahead of the scheduled distribution.The decision came after a federal judge ruled last Friday that the Justice Department must release unredacted material from the original Mueller investigation, a move House Democrats have clamored for in the midst of the ongoing impeachment inquiry.Judge Beryl Howell, an Obama appointee, wrote that the committee “has shown that it needs the grand jury material referenced and cited in the Mueller Report to avoid a possible injustice in the impeachment inquiry.”The DOJ contested Howell’s ruling and issued an emergency appeal, saying a quick release “threatens an irreparable loss of grand-jury secrecy before this court even has a chance to act on the Department’s stay motion.” The government also noted that Howell gave no explanation for her seemingly arbitrary deadline of Wednesday, which was not offered by Democrats.The three-judge D.C. panel — made up of judges appointed by Barack Obama — decided on an administrative stay in order “to give the court sufficient opportunity to consider the emergency motion for stay pending appeal and should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits of that motion,” according to the decision.The debate centers around the validity of redactions to a grand-jury deposition, which is usually kept secret. The DOJ argues that materials in the report are squarely protected by federal evidence regulations, while others point to ongoing criminal matters involved, including a probe by Connecticut U.S attorney John Durham the origins of the investigation.

Al Gore Is Opening a New Front In the War On Climate Change,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 04:00:02 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/al-gore-makes-climate-case-080002432.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Al Gore’s 400-acre farm is located in Carthage, a small Tennessee town where the former vice president and senator traditionally kicked off his political campaigns. During his second act as a famous environmentalist, the farm became the site of a training program for aspiring climate activists, and more recently, an experiment in what Gore said is the world’s most realistic chance at averting climate catastrophe.Topsoil, the foot or so of ground underneath your feet, is responsible for almost all food production on Earth. It also stores more than three times as much carbon as forests. Today, agriculture is a net carbon emitter, contributing about 14% of all greenhouse gas emissions, but unlike power generation or automobiles, it can be turned into a net absorber, pulling carbon out of the atmosphere.If farming practices are changed through the use of cover crops, low-tilling and tree-planting, Gore said, agriculture conglomerates and family farmers alike could theoretically make their farms more productive while fighting global warming. Those changes can also replenish nutrients to the world’s soil, of which 33% has already been depleted.A virtuous circle if there ever was one—and one that’s already attracting attention from farmers, consumers and food companies.Gore, 71, is preaching the benefits of so-called carbon farming, a form of regenerative farming, at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump has been trying to roll back regulations meant to limit greenhouse gas emissions. And while science-based climate policy has been a prominent topic on the Democratic presidential campaign trail, it’s not always seen as a priority.Gore, who these days is more of a denim-wearing advocate than reserved technocrat, remains undeterred. His laboratory has been the farm where his parents once raised livestock and grew tobacco. Earlier this month, he invited 450 soil experts—farmers, scientists, chefs, food experts, entrepreneurs and investors—to join him there to discuss how to scale regenerative farming into something that might actually slow climate change.“We’ve waited so long to start to address the climate crisis,” Gore told those gathered. “We will need to both reduce emissions drastically and take as much carbon out of the atmosphere as we possibly can.”Unlike 2006, when Gore’s film “An Inconvenient Truth” was met with skepticism in some quarters, 13 years of intensifying storms, catastrophic floods and unprecedented droughts and wildfires have persuaded more Americans that there’s a very big problem. The goal now, Gore said, is to get people to start taking carbon farming seriously.When it comes to actually tackling what may soon become an existential crisis, the numbers are daunting. Trillions of dollars are needed to adapt civilization to the near-term consequences of climate change while tens of trillions of dollars are needed to slow its advance. But Gore said there are still too few plans to reverse global warming that don’t rely on technology that has yet to be developed.“Planting trees and sequestering carbon in soil are likely to remain the two most effective approaches,” Gore said in an interview at his Carthage farm. “There’s already some indication that farms that operate this way are more resilient in the face of climate extremes.”Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are at their highest in 3 million years. Oceans, the biggest carbon sinks of all, are acidifying because they hold too much of it. Plant life, which absorbs CO2 through photosynthesis, can sink carbon into the soil. Regenerative farming helps speed that along—with the added benefit of producing more nutrient-rich soil.Rattan Lal, a professor of soil physics and director of Ohio State University’s Carbon Management and Sequestration Center, is the key scientist behind Gore’s thinking. Lal served on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) when it shared a Nobel Prize with Gore in 2007, and was awarded the Japan Prize this year for his work on soil carbon sequestration.The world’s population currently uses more than a third of the planet’s surface for agriculture, according to the United Nations. In the U.S., close to 40% of land is farmland. Soil used for agriculture has degraded and eroded over centuries of use, losing between 20% and 60% of its original carbon content, according to the IPCC. Lal’s research shows that soil can sequester carbon at rates as high as 2.6 gigatons each year. An aggressive, global combination of tree planting and increased vegetation along with soil carbon sequestration, he said, has the “technical potential” to absorb 157 parts per million of CO2.With about 415 parts per million in the air today—a huge jump compared with a few decades ago—removing even a fraction of that could slow the advance of global warming.“There is virtually no analysis that shows the feasibility of doing any of this at scale.”Gore is realistic when it comes to the fraught politics of climate change and the policies that would need to align to make that potential possible. Moreover, carbon farming is a nascent concept in the U.S.: California has a growing program and Hawaii’s plan to become carbon neutral by 2045 includes a carbon farming framework. U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s “Green New Deal,” supported in some form by several Democratic presidential candidates, simply encourages farmers to improve soil health.But even without any legislation on the horizon, big agriculture is starting to pay attention.Eco-conscious shoppers are beginning to look for food farmed with regenerative practices, just as they do for organic products and sustainable packaging. General Mills set a goal in August to have 1 million acres in its supply chain transitioned to regenerative agriculture by 2030, and a group of companies including Danone North America and Unilever’s Ben & Jerry’s have been working on a certification for food farmed with regenerative practices.Not everyone is convinced its time has come, though. Timothy Searchinger, a research scholar at Princeton University who has studied the issue, said scalable carbon farming is still very much a pipe dream.“There is an unbelievable amount of scientific uncertainty,” Searchinger said. “There is virtually no analysis that shows the feasibility of doing any of this at scale.”Indeed, while there is some evidence that soil carbon can be rebuilt on degraded land, the technique requires putting so much nitrogen in the soil that the technique may not be viable in some places, he said. Additionally, many regenerative farmers discover that after a few years of no-till farming, their yields begin to fall. Searchinger said better options for achieving natural carbon sequestration at scale would be to focus on reducing deforestation and preserving peat lands.“It’s not the most useful thing to do in agriculture,” Searchinger said. While carbon farming would be helpful, he said the bigger agricultural climate issue is methane from livestock, something that might be addressed with feed additives.At its most basic, carbon farming is about leaving the ground alone. Simply plowing and tilling fields can disturb soil’s natural structure, releasing stored carbon into the atmosphere and displacing insects and microbes necessary for healthy soil. No-till farming creates fields that are better at acting like a sponge to absorb both water and carbon.Gore’s home state Tennessee leads the U.S. in no-till farming, with more than 78% of its farmland managed that way, versus 37% for the U.S., according to the Soil Health Institute. On his farm, some 10,000 trees have been planted to increase soil carbon. Small groups of cattle and sheep are rotated to graze in different areas, adding natural fertilizer to soils. The farm uses compost and cover crops to keep the soil healthy, rather than for their profit potential.Regenerative farming has more costs than traditional methods, especially upfront. Only about 108 million acres cross the U.S. are using some regenerative practices, according to Project Drawdown, a climate research group (as of 2012, the government said there were 914 million acres of farmland in America). The group estimates it would cost about $57 billion to convert another 1 billion acres by 2050, but that some 23.15 gigatons of CO2 could be sucked out of the atmosphere by doing so.While not a solution to the climate crisis by itself, Lal told the audience at Gore’s farm that regenerative farming could be, at the very least, “a bridge to the future.”Planting the same cash crops each year without rotating them tends to deplete nutrients from soil. Regenerative farming, meanwhile, results in more nutrient dense-crops. But most farmers don’t have any incentive to change what they are doing, because staples like wheat, rice, soybeans and corn are usually covered by federally-subsidized U.S. crop insurance—a $100 billion industry which currently guarantees that more than 290 million acres of U.S. farmland deliver returns for farmers regardless of the harvest.“For most people, this is a very new idea,” said Will Rodger, director of policy communications at the American Farm Bureau Federation. “We’re certainly aware that carbon can be stored in the soil, but farmers have very narrow margins. Many of our members are looking very closely at it, but the question is how to make it a business.”The U.S. Farmers & Ranchers Alliance proposed earlier this year that lenders find more creative financing models to help farmers employ regenerative practices. A study published this month in Nature Climate Change found that deploying land sector strategies like carbon farming, as well as food waste reduction and increasing plant-based diets, could turn farming into a net absorber of carbon as soon as 2050.Gore predicts that popular adoption of regenerative farming will someday take hold the same way residential solar and electric vehicles have caught on. “Farmers are doing this because they think it’s better for them,” Gore said. “I look for signs of hope.”To contact the author of this story: Emily Chasan in New York at echasan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: David Rovella at drovella@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fZi_K4S7kgMEpAkFCdczMg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/2f9b9b938ffcd69bb8fc199a89eedafd,Al Gore Is Opening a New Front In the War On Climate Change

"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:17:36 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/record-wave-lone-child-migrants-122133758.html,"TENOSIQUE, Mexico -- The United States has detained more children trying to cross the nation's southwest border on their own over the last year than during any other period on record, surpassing the surge of unaccompanied minors that set off a crisis during the Obama administration, according to new figures released Tuesday.U.S. immigration authorities apprehended 76,020 minors, most of them from Central America, traveling without their parents in the fiscal year that ended in September -- 52% more than during the last fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Mexico is experiencing the same surge. Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period -- pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.In interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous -- and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.""These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,"" Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters. ""And each month during the fiscal year, the numbers increased. You saw them. We all saw them.""The young migrants came alongside a historic wave of families traveling together, also largely from Central America. They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.Marvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced -- and he pressed on.""Quitting was not an option,"" Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. ""You wipe your tears and carry on.""For the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they'd kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.His parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said. ""We can't bear losing another son,"" they told him. ""You have to go.""He left home in the spring, with $40 in his pocket and no plan except to find work in a safer place.As for most underage migrants traveling without their parents, his trip north has been a feat of improvisation and courage. He walked and hitchhiked through Honduras and Guatemala. He slept in churches, under trees or wherever he found himself when night fell.Along the way, he gathered crucial bits of information from fellow migrants: the best route to take, locations of shelters up ahead, places to avoid, where to forage for food.As huge numbers of young migrants from Central America began arriving at the United States' southern border in 2014, the Obama administration scrambled to house them until they could be released to sponsors -- adults who applied to care for them. The shelter system grew dramatically as a result.The Trump administration experienced similar backups at the border just a few years later -- this time because of new, more stringent policies that made the sponsors themselves, who are often undocumented, vulnerable to immigration authorities. This discouraged people from coming forward, leaving thousands of children to languish in the system.The Trump administration has also sought to deter migration by separating thousands of children from their relatives, again driving up the number of children in federally contracted shelters.On the road, while trying to avoid detention, fear and hunger are constant companions for many young migrants.With little or no money in their pockets, they relied on strangers for snacks or meals. They pawed through garbage and scanned drifts of debris on the roadside, hoping to spot an edible morsel.Wilson, a 17-year-old Honduran, said he had feasted on rotten mangos discarded by street vendors.""I used to drink water from potholes when I was too thirsty,"" interjected Mario Leonel, 16, who left home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, several weeks ago without notifying his parents. ""That is the hardest part of it all: the hunger.""When he arrived at the shelter in Tenosique, a small Mexican town near the Guatemala border, he called his parents in Honduras, who burst into tears and pleaded for him to return. He said no. He was tired of all the violence in his country, and wanted to get asylum in the United States.After Marvel slipped across the Guatemala-Mexico border in May, he found room at a shelter in Tenosique, which serves as a transit point for many migrants. He quickly made new friends among other teenage migrants who had made it this far, mainly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador.On a recent afternoon, several of them gathered in a two-story building that had been reserved for minors, its walls painted with colorful animal murals. The boys cracked jokes, roughhoused and argued about who was the cutest girl in the shelter.Outside, Dulce, a 16-year-old transgender migrant from Guatemala, sat alone on train tracks pining for a boy she had met at the shelter. He had left without explanation and she was lovesick.""I just can't get him out of my mind,"" she said.She left her hometown four months earlier to escape abuse from her family and strangers, including a sexual assault by gang members when she was 12. She made it as far as central Mexico before being detained and deported. Five days after returning home, she set off again.""I left because I had nothing there and no one to protect me,"" she said. ""At least here I am safe.""Though the United States remains the destination of choice for most unaccompanied minors, an increasing number are setting their sights no farther than Mexico, advocates and migrants say.Sometimes they have no choice: Mexico's increased enforcement measures have made it more difficult for migrants to make it to the border with the United States. And even if they reach the United States, recent policies have drastically lowered the possibilities of getting asylum.In Mexico, when unaccompanied minors are detained, the law mandates that they be released right away into the custody of the national child protection agency, which finds them accommodation in shelters designed for children.But migrants' advocates say the government has been holding children in the nation's overcrowded detention centers for far too long, and that some children are quickly funneled into the deportation process rather than being given a fair chance to seek asylum or some other form of relief.""No child should ever be held at a detention center,"" said Elba Coria, a migration expert from the Clinic for Refugees at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City. ""But while international standards consider children's detention as an exceptional measure, amid Mexico's migration chaos, it is the rule.""Neither Marvel nor any of his new friends in the Tenosique shelter had been detained by the authorities. All had managed to cross into Mexico from Guatemala and had applied for asylum in Mexico after talking through their options with the shelter staff.They now plan to remain in Mexico and look for work and study opportunities -- even if they haven't abandoned hope of making it to the United States.""It is every Honduran's boy dream to get to the United States, where there is more money and kids are able to go to school,"" said Jose Angel, 17. He was born with a disability that left him unable to use his arms and left his hometown because his grandmother could no longer take care of him.He was hopeful he could apply for asylum in the United States despite Trump's many efforts to severely lower the number of people granted asylum. ""It is scary, but you have to take a chance,"" he said.On a recent morning, Alan, a 17-year-old Guatemalan migrant, sat on the sidewalk outside a migrant shelter in the city of Palenque, in southern Mexico. He had just crossed the border and was exhausted. Mexican immigration officials had stopped a bus he was on, but he managed to escape into the countryside and hide.Alan planned to take a nap, shower and have a meal before trying illegally to board a freight train known as The Beast. It runs from Mexico's border with Guatemala to its border with the United States and, for decades, migrants have clung to it to speed through much of Mexico.His hope was to make it to the U.S. border and petition for asylum. He was undeterred by Trump's recent efforts to restrict asylum claims or curb immigration.""One way or another, I have to make it to the other side where there are skyscrapers and life is better,"" he said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5ol82jExNHqBHa7IGzz2mw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/03f35d3f9d537a8dc9fe503d06c098de,"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation"

"Former &lt;/&gt;Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:11:25 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/former-time-editor-wants-hate-211125098.html,"A former Time editor claimed that the United States needs a law banning hate speech, and that President Donald Trump “might be in violation of it” if there were one -- because, apparently, he doesn’t notice the irony of holding both of these views at once.In a Tuesday tweet promoting his Washington Post piece, titled “Why America needs a hate speech law,” Richard Stengel stated:> My @WashingtonPost piece on why the very broadness of the First Amendment suggests we should have a hate speech law. And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f> > -- Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019In the piece, Stengel writes that “many nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred” in the wake of World War II:> These laws started out as protections against the kinds of anti-Semitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws, but there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general, hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.“I’m all for protecting ‘thought that we hate,’ but not speech that incites hate,” he continues. “It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.”It’s interesting how Stengel actually does acknowledge the fact that “there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is,” and yet he still wants laws banning it. This makes absolutely no sense. After all, when he calls for laws to ban “hate speech,” he is, inherently, giving the government the power to decide what would and would not qualify -- the exact same government that is led by Donald Trump, and that is full of people who support him.In other words: Stengel somehow trusts that the government will have the same view of “hate speech” as he does, and then, in the same thought, seems to acknowledge that there’s actually no way that many of them would. Unless he thinks that the president and his congressional supporters would actually pass a law that they’d be in violation of, his argument for “hate speech” laws winds up being a pretty great argument against them.It’s ironic, but it’s not new: More often than not, it’s the uber-progressives arguing for laws against “hate speech” -- despite the fact that they’re often the same people who are also arguing that Donald Trump and Republicans are constantly spewing it. Maybe it’s just me, but if I thought that the leader of my government was, you know, literally Hitler or whatever, the last thing that I’d want would be to give that person and their supporters control over my speech.Yes, the First Amendment gives us the right to be “offensive” with our speech. Given the fact that a new thing seems to be declared “racist” or “sexist” every day, I’m certainly glad that we do have this protection. After all, it would only take there being a few too many of the “super woke” in our government for a phrase like “you guys” to become a criminal offense.The truth is, though, the right to be “offensive” (however you define that subjective term, anyway) is not even the most important role that our First Amendment plays. No, what’s most important is that it protects our right to speak out against the government when we see fit -- without having to worry about its retaliation. Like it or not, the only way to ensure that we retain this important check on government power is to never (ever) give its leaders a vehicle take it away.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eTNessteMBpuBTcqmJGuYw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/bae9af12e23cce197b317b5c1be56053,"Former </>Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony"

Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 10:05:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-warren-untenable-plans-140521979.html,"If you’ve been having trouble finding someone to walk your dog, don’t worry. Any day now, Elizabeth Warren will announce “a plan for that.” It will undoubtedly be comprehensive, detailed, and replete with subsidies for lower- and middle-class dog walkers and underserved breeds. It will cost tens of billions of dollars and will receive widespread positive notice from the media. However, to judge by her other recent plans, the one thing it won’t include is any discussion of how she plans to pay for it.The Massachusetts senator has challenged and possibly overtaken former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, largely based on having a plan for the government to tackle every problem facing this country, no matter how big or how small, from issues with military housing to Puerto Rican debt to climate change.The price tag for this massive expansion of government is enormous. Much of the attention in recent weeks has been focused on Warren’s embrace of Medicare for All, which she refuses to admit would require an increase in middle-class taxes. Even Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has conceded that such proposals, which would cost $30–40 trillion over 10 years, cannot be financed without tax hikes. Warren’s refusal to address this obvious fact makes her look less like a would-be policy wonk and more like a typical politician.But even setting aside Medicare for All, Warren’s plans are likely to dump oceans of red ink onto our growing national debt. Her non-health-care spending proposals already total some $7.5 trillion per year over the next 10 years. Although these are not quite Bernie levels of government largesse, her proposals would still require nearly double our current levels of spending.To pay for all this, Warren proposes a variety of tax hikes, mostly designed to hit corporations or high-earners: higher payroll taxes for those earning more than $250,000 per year; a 7 percent profits tax on companies earning more than $100 million; a 60 percent lobbying tax on firms that spend a million or more on lobbying, and so forth. But the biggest chunk of money would come from Warren’s proposed “wealth tax,” a 2 to 3 percent levy on net worth above $50 million. Warren estimates that this wealth tax will pull in more than $2.75 trillion over ten years. It won’t.First, there is the slight problem that a wealth tax is probably unconstitutional. Of course, constitutional constraints are quaint notions in the Age of Trump. Regardless, it is worth noting that the Constitution permits the federal government to impose only “direct taxes,” such as a property tax. That’s why it required a constitutional amendment to enact the federal income tax. Many constitutional scholars warn that a wealth tax is neither a direct tax nor income tax.Even if Warren can find a way around the constitutional guardrails -- perhaps by something such as a retrospective wealth tax in which you wait until a taxpayer sells assets or passes away -- a wealth tax is unlikely to raise anywhere near the amount of money she predicts.Simply look at Europe’s experiments with wealth taxes. At one time, a dozen European countries imposed wealth taxes. Today, all but three have abandoned those levies. Among those repealing their wealth tax are the Scandinavian social democracies that Warren admires, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Norway retains a wealth tax but has significantly reduced it in recent years. Additional countries abandoning the tax include Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Other countries, such as Great Britain, have considered wealth taxes and rejected them.They did so because wealth taxes are administratively complex and difficult to enforce. Also, they significantly reduce investment, entrepreneurship, and, ultimately, economic growth. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, European wealth taxes raised, on average, only about 0.2 percent of GDP in revenues. By comparison, the U.S. federal income tax raises 8 percent of GDP.Two groups, however, would benefit substantially from a wealth tax. The tax would be a full-employment opportunity for the tax-preparation industry and for lawyers. After all, we would now have to determine fair market value for everything from homes and vehicles to artwork and jewelry to family pension rights and intellectual property. The other big winner would be lobbyists, who could be expected to descend on Washington en masse seeking exemptions and exceptions for their clients. If you think the tax code is a mess today, just wait until D.C. is done with Warren’s plan.There is an old Yiddish proverb that goes “Mann tracht, un Gott Lacht,” or “Man plans, and God laughs.” It is all well and good that Senator Warren has a plan for everything. But until she actually figures out how to pay for everything without crippling our economy, such plans really don’t add up.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/t_XOfhQ2Q8pn0Eihbaza4g--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/710b4188b8e44ebd02c332c03dfb8d66,Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans
Meghan McCain Spars With Cory Booker Over Civility: Beto Was ‘Very Nasty’ to Me!,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:39:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/meghan-mccain-spars-cory-booker-163901660.html,"During a Wednesday interview with Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, The View’s Meghan McCain did what she apparently does best: Make the conversation about herself and, in this case, her personal beef with a presidential hopeful.After applauding Booker for saying Medicare for All is unrealistic, the conservative View co-host took issue with the New Jersey senator’s support for mandatory gun buybacks. This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he’s going to take her brother’s guns.After a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they’d continue the conversation in the next segment.“No we’re not,” McCain grumbled. “It’s fine.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Tucker Carlson and Guest Blame Diversity and ‘Woke’ Culture for California Fires,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 07:17:19 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/tucker-carlson-guest-blame-diversity-032855316.html,"Fox NewsFox News host Tucker Carlson and his guest, conservative YouTube personality Dave Rubin, both insisted Tuesday night that the wildfires burning across California are due largely to progressive ideology, “woke” culture, and diversity in hiring.During Tuesday’s broadcast of Tucker Carlson Tonight, Carlson welcomed on Rubin, a political commentator and podcaster, to discuss the issues surrounding the large fires engulfing the state, including those related to the electrical grid and firefighting methods.“PG&E; strikes me as almost a metaphor for the destruction of the state,” Carlson said about the state’s power company. “Here’s the utility which doesn’t really know anything about its own infrastructure but knows everything about the race of its employees. How did we get there?”After noting that he lives near one of the fires in the Los Angeles area, Rubin immediately took aim at liberal politics as the main reason the wildfires have grown so large and dangerous.“The problem right now is that everything, EVERYTHING, from academia to public utilities to politics, everything that goes woke, that buys into this ridiculous progressive ideology that cares about what contractors are LGBT or how many black firemen we have or white this or Asian that, everything that goes that road eventually breaks down,” he declared.As Carlson nodded and said “that’s true,” Rubin continued, complaining that this isn’t how “freedom is supposed to operate.”“What is supposed to happen—imagine if your house was on fire,” he added. “Would you care what the public utility or what the fire company, what contractor they brought in, what gender or sexuality or any of those things he or she was?

A staffer sitting behind her was captured on video as her eyes widened in shock.""You have demonstrated that you will pursue this heinous white supremacist ideology at all costs,"" said Wasserman Schultz. Cuccinelli answered that neither he nor the President was a white supremacist.""That's false,"" Cuccinelli said, calling Wasserman Schultz's statements ""defamatory.""Cuccinelli had been summoned to the hearing to discuss the Trump administration's decision to temporarily stop granting deportation deferments for illegal aliens receiving life-saving treatment in the U.S.Representative Ayanna Pressley (D., Ohio) also entered into a heated exchange with Cuccinelli over who was responsible for the decision, himself or White House officials. Cuccinelli repeatedly asserted that he made the decision and that no White House official was involved.Trump had considered appointing Cuccinelli secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. However, Senator Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) said the idea was a non-starter.“It’s my understanding that the existing law would not permit him to” lead the organization, Grassley said. “I don’t know how you get around that.” Grassley was referring to current laws that govern succession rules within the federal government.On Tuesday, a top Border Patrol official warned that illegal immigration could hit crisis levels if courts keep blocking Trump's immigration policies.""We will go back, mark the words, we will go back to the crisis level that we had before,"" said chief of law enforcement operations for the Border Patrol Brian Hastings.

Circuit for the U.S. Court of Appeals on Tuesday night halted the scheduled release of grand-jury materials from Robert Mueller’s investigation, just hours ahead of the scheduled distribution.The decision came after a federal judge ruled last Friday that the Justice Department must release unredacted material from the original Mueller investigation, a move House Democrats have clamored for in the midst of the ongoing impeachment inquiry.Judge Beryl Howell, an Obama appointee, wrote that the committee “has shown that it needs the grand jury material referenced and cited in the Mueller Report to avoid a possible injustice in the impeachment inquiry.”The DOJ contested Howell’s ruling and issued an emergency appeal, saying a quick release “threatens an irreparable loss of grand-jury secrecy before this court even has a chance to act on the Department’s stay motion.” The government also noted that Howell gave no explanation for her seemingly arbitrary deadline of Wednesday, which was not offered by Democrats.The three-judge D.C. panel — made up of judges appointed by Barack Obama — decided on an administrative stay in order “to give the court sufficient opportunity to consider the emergency motion for stay pending appeal and should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits of that motion,” according to the decision.The debate centers around the validity of redactions to a grand-jury deposition, which is usually kept secret. The DOJ argues that materials in the report are squarely protected by federal evidence regulations, while others point to ongoing criminal matters involved, including a probe by Connecticut U.S attorney John Durham the origins of the investigation.

Al Gore Is Opening a New Front In the War On Climate Change,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 04:00:02 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/al-gore-makes-climate-case-080002432.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Al Gore’s 400-acre farm is located in Carthage, a small Tennessee town where the former vice president and senator traditionally kicked off his political campaigns. During his second act as a famous environmentalist, the farm became the site of a training program for aspiring climate activists, and more recently, an experiment in what Gore said is the world’s most realistic chance at averting climate catastrophe.Topsoil, the foot or so of ground underneath your feet, is responsible for almost all food production on Earth. It also stores more than three times as much carbon as forests. Today, agriculture is a net carbon emitter, contributing about 14% of all greenhouse gas emissions, but unlike power generation or automobiles, it can be turned into a net absorber, pulling carbon out of the atmosphere.If farming practices are changed through the use of cover crops, low-tilling and tree-planting, Gore said, agriculture conglomerates and family farmers alike could theoretically make their farms more productive while fighting global warming. Those changes can also replenish nutrients to the world’s soil, of which 33% has already been depleted.A virtuous circle if there ever was one—and one that’s already attracting attention from farmers, consumers and food companies.Gore, 71, is preaching the benefits of so-called carbon farming, a form of regenerative farming, at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump has been trying to roll back regulations meant to limit greenhouse gas emissions. And while science-based climate policy has been a prominent topic on the Democratic presidential campaign trail, it’s not always seen as a priority.Gore, who these days is more of a denim-wearing advocate than reserved technocrat, remains undeterred. His laboratory has been the farm where his parents once raised livestock and grew tobacco. Earlier this month, he invited 450 soil experts—farmers, scientists, chefs, food experts, entrepreneurs and investors—to join him there to discuss how to scale regenerative farming into something that might actually slow climate change.“We’ve waited so long to start to address the climate crisis,” Gore told those gathered. “We will need to both reduce emissions drastically and take as much carbon out of the atmosphere as we possibly can.”Unlike 2006, when Gore’s film “An Inconvenient Truth” was met with skepticism in some quarters, 13 years of intensifying storms, catastrophic floods and unprecedented droughts and wildfires have persuaded more Americans that there’s a very big problem. The goal now, Gore said, is to get people to start taking carbon farming seriously.When it comes to actually tackling what may soon become an existential crisis, the numbers are daunting. Trillions of dollars are needed to adapt civilization to the near-term consequences of climate change while tens of trillions of dollars are needed to slow its advance. But Gore said there are still too few plans to reverse global warming that don’t rely on technology that has yet to be developed.“Planting trees and sequestering carbon in soil are likely to remain the two most effective approaches,” Gore said in an interview at his Carthage farm. “There’s already some indication that farms that operate this way are more resilient in the face of climate extremes.”Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are at their highest in 3 million years. Oceans, the biggest carbon sinks of all, are acidifying because they hold too much of it. Plant life, which absorbs CO2 through photosynthesis, can sink carbon into the soil. Regenerative farming helps speed that along—with the added benefit of producing more nutrient-rich soil.Rattan Lal, a professor of soil physics and director of Ohio State University’s Carbon Management and Sequestration Center, is the key scientist behind Gore’s thinking. Lal served on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) when it shared a Nobel Prize with Gore in 2007, and was awarded the Japan Prize this year for his work on soil carbon sequestration.The world’s population currently uses more than a third of the planet’s surface for agriculture, according to the United Nations. In the U.S., close to 40% of land is farmland. Soil used for agriculture has degraded and eroded over centuries of use, losing between 20% and 60% of its original carbon content, according to the IPCC. Lal’s research shows that soil can sequester carbon at rates as high as 2.6 gigatons each year. An aggressive, global combination of tree planting and increased vegetation along with soil carbon sequestration, he said, has the “technical potential” to absorb 157 parts per million of CO2.With about 415 parts per million in the air today—a huge jump compared with a few decades ago—removing even a fraction of that could slow the advance of global warming.“There is virtually no analysis that shows the feasibility of doing any of this at scale.”Gore is realistic when it comes to the fraught politics of climate change and the policies that would need to align to make that potential possible. Moreover, carbon farming is a nascent concept in the U.S.: California has a growing program and Hawaii’s plan to become carbon neutral by 2045 includes a carbon farming framework. U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s “Green New Deal,” supported in some form by several Democratic presidential candidates, simply encourages farmers to improve soil health.But even without any legislation on the horizon, big agriculture is starting to pay attention.Eco-conscious shoppers are beginning to look for food farmed with regenerative practices, just as they do for organic products and sustainable packaging. General Mills set a goal in August to have 1 million acres in its supply chain transitioned to regenerative agriculture by 2030, and a group of companies including Danone North America and Unilever’s Ben & Jerry’s have been working on a certification for food farmed with regenerative practices.Not everyone is convinced its time has come, though. Timothy Searchinger, a research scholar at Princeton University who has studied the issue, said scalable carbon farming is still very much a pipe dream.“There is an unbelievable amount of scientific uncertainty,” Searchinger said. “There is virtually no analysis that shows the feasibility of doing any of this at scale.”Indeed, while there is some evidence that soil carbon can be rebuilt on degraded land, the technique requires putting so much nitrogen in the soil that the technique may not be viable in some places, he said. Additionally, many regenerative farmers discover that after a few years of no-till farming, their yields begin to fall. Searchinger said better options for achieving natural carbon sequestration at scale would be to focus on reducing deforestation and preserving peat lands.“It’s not the most useful thing to do in agriculture,” Searchinger said. While carbon farming would be helpful, he said the bigger agricultural climate issue is methane from livestock, something that might be addressed with feed additives.At its most basic, carbon farming is about leaving the ground alone. Simply plowing and tilling fields can disturb soil’s natural structure, releasing stored carbon into the atmosphere and displacing insects and microbes necessary for healthy soil. No-till farming creates fields that are better at acting like a sponge to absorb both water and carbon.Gore’s home state Tennessee leads the U.S. in no-till farming, with more than 78% of its farmland managed that way, versus 37% for the U.S., according to the Soil Health Institute. On his farm, some 10,000 trees have been planted to increase soil carbon. Small groups of cattle and sheep are rotated to graze in different areas, adding natural fertilizer to soils. The farm uses compost and cover crops to keep the soil healthy, rather than for their profit potential.Regenerative farming has more costs than traditional methods, especially upfront. Only about 108 million acres cross the U.S. are using some regenerative practices, according to Project Drawdown, a climate research group (as of 2012, the government said there were 914 million acres of farmland in America). The group estimates it would cost about $57 billion to convert another 1 billion acres by 2050, but that some 23.15 gigatons of CO2 could be sucked out of the atmosphere by doing so.While not a solution to the climate crisis by itself, Lal told the audience at Gore’s farm that regenerative farming could be, at the very least, “a bridge to the future.”Planting the same cash crops each year without rotating them tends to deplete nutrients from soil. Regenerative farming, meanwhile, results in more nutrient dense-crops. But most farmers don’t have any incentive to change what they are doing, because staples like wheat, rice, soybeans and corn are usually covered by federally-subsidized U.S. crop insurance—a $100 billion industry which currently guarantees that more than 290 million acres of U.S. farmland deliver returns for farmers regardless of the harvest.“For most people, this is a very new idea,” said Will Rodger, director of policy communications at the American Farm Bureau Federation. “We’re certainly aware that carbon can be stored in the soil, but farmers have very narrow margins. Many of our members are looking very closely at it, but the question is how to make it a business.”The U.S. Farmers & Ranchers Alliance proposed earlier this year that lenders find more creative financing models to help farmers employ regenerative practices. A study published this month in Nature Climate Change found that deploying land sector strategies like carbon farming, as well as food waste reduction and increasing plant-based diets, could turn farming into a net absorber of carbon as soon as 2050.Gore predicts that popular adoption of regenerative farming will someday take hold the same way residential solar and electric vehicles have caught on. “Farmers are doing this because they think it’s better for them,” Gore said. “I look for signs of hope.”To contact the author of this story: Emily Chasan in New York at echasan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: David Rovella at drovella@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fZi_K4S7kgMEpAkFCdczMg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/2f9b9b938ffcd69bb8fc199a89eedafd,Al Gore Is Opening a New Front In the War On Climate Change

"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:17:36 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/record-wave-lone-child-migrants-122133758.html,"TENOSIQUE, Mexico -- The United States has detained more children trying to cross the nation's southwest border on their own over the last year than during any other period on record, surpassing the surge of unaccompanied minors that set off a crisis during the Obama administration, according to new figures released Tuesday.U.S. immigration authorities apprehended 76,020 minors, most of them from Central America, traveling without their parents in the fiscal year that ended in September -- 52% more than during the last fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Mexico is experiencing the same surge. Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period -- pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.In interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous -- and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.""These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,"" Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters. ""And each month during the fiscal year, the numbers increased. You saw them. We all saw them.""The young migrants came alongside a historic wave of families traveling together, also largely from Central America. They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.Marvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced -- and he pressed on.""Quitting was not an option,"" Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. ""You wipe your tears and carry on.""For the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they'd kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.His parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said. ""We can't bear losing another son,"" they told him. ""You have to go.""He left home in the spring, with $40 in his pocket and no plan except to find work in a safer place.As for most underage migrants traveling without their parents, his trip north has been a feat of improvisation and courage. He walked and hitchhiked through Honduras and Guatemala. He slept in churches, under trees or wherever he found himself when night fell.Along the way, he gathered crucial bits of information from fellow migrants: the best route to take, locations of shelters up ahead, places to avoid, where to forage for food.As huge numbers of young migrants from Central America began arriving at the United States' southern border in 2014, the Obama administration scrambled to house them until they could be released to sponsors -- adults who applied to care for them. The shelter system grew dramatically as a result.The Trump administration experienced similar backups at the border just a few years later -- this time because of new, more stringent policies that made the sponsors themselves, who are often undocumented, vulnerable to immigration authorities. This discouraged people from coming forward, leaving thousands of children to languish in the system.The Trump administration has also sought to deter migration by separating thousands of children from their relatives, again driving up the number of children in federally contracted shelters.On the road, while trying to avoid detention, fear and hunger are constant companions for many young migrants.With little or no money in their pockets, they relied on strangers for snacks or meals. They pawed through garbage and scanned drifts of debris on the roadside, hoping to spot an edible morsel.Wilson, a 17-year-old Honduran, said he had feasted on rotten mangos discarded by street vendors.""I used to drink water from potholes when I was too thirsty,"" interjected Mario Leonel, 16, who left home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, several weeks ago without notifying his parents. ""That is the hardest part of it all: the hunger.""When he arrived at the shelter in Tenosique, a small Mexican town near the Guatemala border, he called his parents in Honduras, who burst into tears and pleaded for him to return. He said no. He was tired of all the violence in his country, and wanted to get asylum in the United States.After Marvel slipped across the Guatemala-Mexico border in May, he found room at a shelter in Tenosique, which serves as a transit point for many migrants. He quickly made new friends among other teenage migrants who had made it this far, mainly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador.On a recent afternoon, several of them gathered in a two-story building that had been reserved for minors, its walls painted with colorful animal murals. The boys cracked jokes, roughhoused and argued about who was the cutest girl in the shelter.Outside, Dulce, a 16-year-old transgender migrant from Guatemala, sat alone on train tracks pining for a boy she had met at the shelter. He had left without explanation and she was lovesick.""I just can't get him out of my mind,"" she said.She left her hometown four months earlier to escape abuse from her family and strangers, including a sexual assault by gang members when she was 12. She made it as far as central Mexico before being detained and deported. Five days after returning home, she set off again.""I left because I had nothing there and no one to protect me,"" she said. ""At least here I am safe.""Though the United States remains the destination of choice for most unaccompanied minors, an increasing number are setting their sights no farther than Mexico, advocates and migrants say.Sometimes they have no choice: Mexico's increased enforcement measures have made it more difficult for migrants to make it to the border with the United States. And even if they reach the United States, recent policies have drastically lowered the possibilities of getting asylum.In Mexico, when unaccompanied minors are detained, the law mandates that they be released right away into the custody of the national child protection agency, which finds them accommodation in shelters designed for children.But migrants' advocates say the government has been holding children in the nation's overcrowded detention centers for far too long, and that some children are quickly funneled into the deportation process rather than being given a fair chance to seek asylum or some other form of relief.""No child should ever be held at a detention center,"" said Elba Coria, a migration expert from the Clinic for Refugees at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City. ""But while international standards consider children's detention as an exceptional measure, amid Mexico's migration chaos, it is the rule.""Neither Marvel nor any of his new friends in the Tenosique shelter had been detained by the authorities. All had managed to cross into Mexico from Guatemala and had applied for asylum in Mexico after talking through their options with the shelter staff.They now plan to remain in Mexico and look for work and study opportunities -- even if they haven't abandoned hope of making it to the United States.""It is every Honduran's boy dream to get to the United States, where there is more money and kids are able to go to school,"" said Jose Angel, 17.

"Former &lt;/&gt;Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:11:25 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/former-time-editor-wants-hate-211125098.html,"A former Time editor claimed that the United States needs a law banning hate speech, and that President Donald Trump “might be in violation of it” if there were one -- because, apparently, he doesn’t notice the irony of holding both of these views at once.In a Tuesday tweet promoting his Washington Post piece, titled “Why America needs a hate speech law,” Richard Stengel stated:> My @WashingtonPost piece on why the very broadness of the First Amendment suggests we should have a hate speech law. And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f> > -- Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019In the piece, Stengel writes that “many nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred” in the wake of World War II:> These laws started out as protections against the kinds of anti-Semitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws, but there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general, hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.“I’m all for protecting ‘thought that we hate,’ but not speech that incites hate,” he continues. “It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.”It’s interesting how Stengel actually does acknowledge the fact that “there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is,” and yet he still wants laws banning it. This makes absolutely no sense. After all, when he calls for laws to ban “hate speech,” he is, inherently, giving the government the power to decide what would and would not qualify -- the exact same government that is led by Donald Trump, and that is full of people who support him.In other words: Stengel somehow trusts that the government will have the same view of “hate speech” as he does, and then, in the same thought, seems to acknowledge that there’s actually no way that many of them would. Unless he thinks that the president and his congressional supporters would actually pass a law that they’d be in violation of, his argument for “hate speech” laws winds up being a pretty great argument against them.It’s ironic, but it’s not new: More often than not, it’s the uber-progressives arguing for laws against “hate speech” -- despite the fact that they’re often the same people who are also arguing that Donald Trump and Republicans are constantly spewing it. Maybe it’s just me, but if I thought that the leader of my government was, you know, literally Hitler or whatever, the last thing that I’d want would be to give that person and their supporters control over my speech.Yes, the First Amendment gives us the right to be “offensive” with our speech. Given the fact that a new thing seems to be declared “racist” or “sexist” every day, I’m certainly glad that we do have this protection. After all, it would only take there being a few too many of the “super woke” in our government for a phrase like “you guys” to become a criminal offense.The truth is, though, the right to be “offensive” (however you define that subjective term, anyway) is not even the most important role that our First Amendment plays. No, what’s most important is that it protects our right to speak out against the government when we see fit -- without having to worry about its retaliation. Like it or not, the only way to ensure that we retain this important check on government power is to never (ever) give its leaders a vehicle take it away.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eTNessteMBpuBTcqmJGuYw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/bae9af12e23cce197b317b5c1be56053,"Former </>Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony"

Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 10:05:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-warren-untenable-plans-140521979.html,"If you’ve been having trouble finding someone to walk your dog, don’t worry. Any day now, Elizabeth Warren will announce “a plan for that.” It will undoubtedly be comprehensive, detailed, and replete with subsidies for lower- and middle-class dog walkers and underserved breeds. It will cost tens of billions of dollars and will receive widespread positive notice from the media. However, to judge by her other recent plans, the one thing it won’t include is any discussion of how she plans to pay for it.The Massachusetts senator has challenged and possibly overtaken former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, largely based on having a plan for the government to tackle every problem facing this country, no matter how big or how small, from issues with military housing to Puerto Rican debt to climate change.The price tag for this massive expansion of government is enormous. Much of the attention in recent weeks has been focused on Warren’s embrace of Medicare for All, which she refuses to admit would require an increase in middle-class taxes. Even Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has conceded that such proposals, which would cost $30–40 trillion over 10 years, cannot be financed without tax hikes. Warren’s refusal to address this obvious fact makes her look less like a would-be policy wonk and more like a typical politician.But even setting aside Medicare for All, Warren’s plans are likely to dump oceans of red ink onto our growing national debt. Her non-health-care spending proposals already total some $7.5 trillion per year over the next 10 years. Although these are not quite Bernie levels of government largesse, her proposals would still require nearly double our current levels of spending.To pay for all this, Warren proposes a variety of tax hikes, mostly designed to hit corporations or high-earners: higher payroll taxes for those earning more than $250,000 per year; a 7 percent profits tax on companies earning more than $100 million; a 60 percent lobbying tax on firms that spend a million or more on lobbying, and so forth. But the biggest chunk of money would come from Warren’s proposed “wealth tax,” a 2 to 3 percent levy on net worth above $50 million. Warren estimates that this wealth tax will pull in more than $2.75 trillion over ten years. It won’t.First, there is the slight problem that a wealth tax is probably unconstitutional. Of course, constitutional constraints are quaint notions in the Age of Trump. Regardless, it is worth noting that the Constitution permits the federal government to impose only “direct taxes,” such as a property tax. That’s why it required a constitutional amendment to enact the federal income tax. Many constitutional scholars warn that a wealth tax is neither a direct tax nor income tax.Even if Warren can find a way around the constitutional guardrails -- perhaps by something such as a retrospective wealth tax in which you wait until a taxpayer sells assets or passes away -- a wealth tax is unlikely to raise anywhere near the amount of money she predicts.Simply look at Europe’s experiments with wealth taxes. At one time, a dozen European countries imposed wealth taxes. Today, all but three have abandoned those levies. Among those repealing their wealth tax are the Scandinavian social democracies that Warren admires, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Norway retains a wealth tax but has significantly reduced it in recent years. Additional countries abandoning the tax include Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Other countries, such as Great Britain, have considered wealth taxes and rejected them.They did so because wealth taxes are administratively complex and difficult to enforce. Also, they significantly reduce investment, entrepreneurship, and, ultimately, economic growth. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, European wealth taxes raised, on average, only about 0.2 percent of GDP in revenues. By comparison, the U.S. federal income tax raises 8 percent of GDP.Two groups, however, would benefit substantially from a wealth tax. The tax would be a full-employment opportunity for the tax-preparation industry and for lawyers. After all, we would now have to determine fair market value for everything from homes and vehicles to artwork and jewelry to family pension rights and intellectual property. The other big winner would be lobbyists, who could be expected to descend on Washington en masse seeking exemptions and exceptions for their clients. If you think the tax code is a mess today, just wait until D.C. is done with Warren’s plan.There is an old Yiddish proverb that goes “Mann tracht, un Gott Lacht,” or “Man plans, and God laughs.” It is all well and good that Senator Warren has a plan for everything. But until she actually figures out how to pay for everything without crippling our economy, such plans really don’t add up.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/t_XOfhQ2Q8pn0Eihbaza4g--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/710b4188b8e44ebd02c332c03dfb8d66,Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans
Meghan McCain Spars With Cory Booker Over Civility: Beto Was ‘Very Nasty’ to Me!,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:39:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/meghan-mccain-spars-cory-booker-163901660.html,"During a Wednesday interview with Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, The View’s Meghan McCain did what she apparently does best: Make the conversation about herself and, in this case, her personal beef with a presidential hopeful.After applauding Booker for saying Medicare for All is unrealistic, the conservative View co-host took issue with the New Jersey senator’s support for mandatory gun buybacks. This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he’s going to take her brother’s guns.After a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they’d continue the conversation in the next segment.“No we’re not,” McCain grumbled. “It’s fine.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

How did we get there?”After noting that he lives near one of the fires in the Los Angeles area, Rubin immediately took aim at liberal politics as the main reason the wildfires have grown so large and dangerous.“The problem right now is that everything, EVERYTHING, from academia to public utilities to politics, everything that goes woke, that buys into this ridiculous progressive ideology that cares about what contractors are LGBT or how many black firemen we have or white this or Asian that, everything that goes that road eventually breaks down,” he declared.As Carlson nodded and said “that’s true,” Rubin continued, complaining that this isn’t how “freedom is supposed to operate.”“What is supposed to happen—imagine if your house was on fire,” he added. “Would you care what the public utility or what the fire company, what contractor they brought in, what gender or sexuality or any of those things he or she was? It’s just absolutely ridiculous.”The Fox News host continued to agree with Rubin, who went on to tie PG&E;’s preemptive blackouts to a lack of “libertarian or conservative-minded people in California to fight what the progressives are doing to the state.”“If you can’t keep the lights on and you can’t keep the place from burning down, you’ve reached the point where there is no kind of lying about it anymore,” Carlson concluded. “It’s falling apart.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz accused President Trump and acting U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Ken Cuccinelli on Wednesday of implementing immigration policy in service of a ""white supremacist ideology.""The accusations came during a hearing of the House Oversight Committee on immigration policy.""You and Mr. Trump don't want anyone who looks or talks or differently than Caucasian Americans to be allowed into this country,"" Wasserman Schultz began. A staffer sitting behind her was captured on video as her eyes widened in shock.""You have demonstrated that you will pursue this heinous white supremacist ideology at all costs,"" said Wasserman Schultz. Cuccinelli answered that neither he nor the President was a white supremacist.""That's false,"" Cuccinelli said, calling Wasserman Schultz's statements ""defamatory.""Cuccinelli had been summoned to the hearing to discuss the Trump administration's decision to temporarily stop granting deportation deferments for illegal aliens receiving life-saving treatment in the U.S.Representative Ayanna Pressley (D., Ohio) also entered into a heated exchange with Cuccinelli over who was responsible for the decision, himself or White House officials. Cuccinelli repeatedly asserted that he made the decision and that no White House official was involved.Trump had considered appointing Cuccinelli secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. However, Senator Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) said the idea was a non-starter.“It’s my understanding that the existing law would not permit him to” lead the organization, Grassley said. “I don’t know how you get around that.” Grassley was referring to current laws that govern succession rules within the federal government.On Tuesday, a top Border Patrol official warned that illegal immigration could hit crisis levels if courts keep blocking Trump's immigration policies.""We will go back, mark the words, we will go back to the crisis level that we had before,"" said chief of law enforcement operations for the Border Patrol Brian Hastings.

Circuit for the U.S. Court of Appeals on Tuesday night halted the scheduled release of grand-jury materials from Robert Mueller’s investigation, just hours ahead of the scheduled distribution.The decision came after a federal judge ruled last Friday that the Justice Department must release unredacted material from the original Mueller investigation, a move House Democrats have clamored for in the midst of the ongoing impeachment inquiry.Judge Beryl Howell, an Obama appointee, wrote that the committee “has shown that it needs the grand jury material referenced and cited in the Mueller Report to avoid a possible injustice in the impeachment inquiry.”The DOJ contested Howell’s ruling and issued an emergency appeal, saying a quick release “threatens an irreparable loss of grand-jury secrecy before this court even has a chance to act on the Department’s stay motion.” The government also noted that Howell gave no explanation for her seemingly arbitrary deadline of Wednesday, which was not offered by Democrats.The three-judge D.C. panel — made up of judges appointed by Barack Obama — decided on an administrative stay in order “to give the court sufficient opportunity to consider the emergency motion for stay pending appeal and should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits of that motion,” according to the decision.The debate centers around the validity of redactions to a grand-jury deposition, which is usually kept secret. The DOJ argues that materials in the report are squarely protected by federal evidence regulations, while others point to ongoing criminal matters involved, including a probe by Connecticut U.S attorney John Durham the origins of the investigation.

Al Gore Is Opening a New Front In the War On Climate Change,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 04:00:02 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/al-gore-makes-climate-case-080002432.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Al Gore’s 400-acre farm is located in Carthage, a small Tennessee town where the former vice president and senator traditionally kicked off his political campaigns. During his second act as a famous environmentalist, the farm became the site of a training program for aspiring climate activists, and more recently, an experiment in what Gore said is the world’s most realistic chance at averting climate catastrophe.Topsoil, the foot or so of ground underneath your feet, is responsible for almost all food production on Earth. It also stores more than three times as much carbon as forests. Today, agriculture is a net carbon emitter, contributing about 14% of all greenhouse gas emissions, but unlike power generation or automobiles, it can be turned into a net absorber, pulling carbon out of the atmosphere.If farming practices are changed through the use of cover crops, low-tilling and tree-planting, Gore said, agriculture conglomerates and family farmers alike could theoretically make their farms more productive while fighting global warming. Those changes can also replenish nutrients to the world’s soil, of which 33% has already been depleted.A virtuous circle if there ever was one—and one that’s already attracting attention from farmers, consumers and food companies.Gore, 71, is preaching the benefits of so-called carbon farming, a form of regenerative farming, at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump has been trying to roll back regulations meant to limit greenhouse gas emissions. And while science-based climate policy has been a prominent topic on the Democratic presidential campaign trail, it’s not always seen as a priority.Gore, who these days is more of a denim-wearing advocate than reserved technocrat, remains undeterred. His laboratory has been the farm where his parents once raised livestock and grew tobacco. Earlier this month, he invited 450 soil experts—farmers, scientists, chefs, food experts, entrepreneurs and investors—to join him there to discuss how to scale regenerative farming into something that might actually slow climate change.“We’ve waited so long to start to address the climate crisis,” Gore told those gathered. “We will need to both reduce emissions drastically and take as much carbon out of the atmosphere as we possibly can.”Unlike 2006, when Gore’s film “An Inconvenient Truth” was met with skepticism in some quarters, 13 years of intensifying storms, catastrophic floods and unprecedented droughts and wildfires have persuaded more Americans that there’s a very big problem. The goal now, Gore said, is to get people to start taking carbon farming seriously.When it comes to actually tackling what may soon become an existential crisis, the numbers are daunting. Trillions of dollars are needed to adapt civilization to the near-term consequences of climate change while tens of trillions of dollars are needed to slow its advance. But Gore said there are still too few plans to reverse global warming that don’t rely on technology that has yet to be developed.“Planting trees and sequestering carbon in soil are likely to remain the two most effective approaches,” Gore said in an interview at his Carthage farm. “There’s already some indication that farms that operate this way are more resilient in the face of climate extremes.”Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are at their highest in 3 million years. Oceans, the biggest carbon sinks of all, are acidifying because they hold too much of it. Plant life, which absorbs CO2 through photosynthesis, can sink carbon into the soil. Regenerative farming helps speed that along—with the added benefit of producing more nutrient-rich soil.Rattan Lal, a professor of soil physics and director of Ohio State University’s Carbon Management and Sequestration Center, is the key scientist behind Gore’s thinking. Lal served on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) when it shared a Nobel Prize with Gore in 2007, and was awarded the Japan Prize this year for his work on soil carbon sequestration.The world’s population currently uses more than a third of the planet’s surface for agriculture, according to the United Nations. In the U.S., close to 40% of land is farmland. Soil used for agriculture has degraded and eroded over centuries of use, losing between 20% and 60% of its original carbon content, according to the IPCC. Lal’s research shows that soil can sequester carbon at rates as high as 2.6 gigatons each year. An aggressive, global combination of tree planting and increased vegetation along with soil carbon sequestration, he said, has the “technical potential” to absorb 157 parts per million of CO2.With about 415 parts per million in the air today—a huge jump compared with a few decades ago—removing even a fraction of that could slow the advance of global warming.“There is virtually no analysis that shows the feasibility of doing any of this at scale.”Gore is realistic when it comes to the fraught politics of climate change and the policies that would need to align to make that potential possible. Moreover, carbon farming is a nascent concept in the U.S.: California has a growing program and Hawaii’s plan to become carbon neutral by 2045 includes a carbon farming framework. U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s “Green New Deal,” supported in some form by several Democratic presidential candidates, simply encourages farmers to improve soil health.But even without any legislation on the horizon, big agriculture is starting to pay attention.Eco-conscious shoppers are beginning to look for food farmed with regenerative practices, just as they do for organic products and sustainable packaging. General Mills set a goal in August to have 1 million acres in its supply chain transitioned to regenerative agriculture by 2030, and a group of companies including Danone North America and Unilever’s Ben & Jerry’s have been working on a certification for food farmed with regenerative practices.Not everyone is convinced its time has come, though. Timothy Searchinger, a research scholar at Princeton University who has studied the issue, said scalable carbon farming is still very much a pipe dream.“There is an unbelievable amount of scientific uncertainty,” Searchinger said. “There is virtually no analysis that shows the feasibility of doing any of this at scale.”Indeed, while there is some evidence that soil carbon can be rebuilt on degraded land, the technique requires putting so much nitrogen in the soil that the technique may not be viable in some places, he said. Additionally, many regenerative farmers discover that after a few years of no-till farming, their yields begin to fall. Searchinger said better options for achieving natural carbon sequestration at scale would be to focus on reducing deforestation and preserving peat lands.“It’s not the most useful thing to do in agriculture,” Searchinger said. While carbon farming would be helpful, he said the bigger agricultural climate issue is methane from livestock, something that might be addressed with feed additives.At its most basic, carbon farming is about leaving the ground alone. Simply plowing and tilling fields can disturb soil’s natural structure, releasing stored carbon into the atmosphere and displacing insects and microbes necessary for healthy soil. No-till farming creates fields that are better at acting like a sponge to absorb both water and carbon.Gore’s home state Tennessee leads the U.S. in no-till farming, with more than 78% of its farmland managed that way, versus 37% for the U.S., according to the Soil Health Institute. On his farm, some 10,000 trees have been planted to increase soil carbon. Small groups of cattle and sheep are rotated to graze in different areas, adding natural fertilizer to soils. The farm uses compost and cover crops to keep the soil healthy, rather than for their profit potential.Regenerative farming has more costs than traditional methods, especially upfront. Only about 108 million acres cross the U.S. are using some regenerative practices, according to Project Drawdown, a climate research group (as of 2012, the government said there were 914 million acres of farmland in America). The group estimates it would cost about $57 billion to convert another 1 billion acres by 2050, but that some 23.15 gigatons of CO2 could be sucked out of the atmosphere by doing so.While not a solution to the climate crisis by itself, Lal told the audience at Gore’s farm that regenerative farming could be, at the very least, “a bridge to the future.”Planting the same cash crops each year without rotating them tends to deplete nutrients from soil. Regenerative farming, meanwhile, results in more nutrient dense-crops. But most farmers don’t have any incentive to change what they are doing, because staples like wheat, rice, soybeans and corn are usually covered by federally-subsidized U.S. crop insurance—a $100 billion industry which currently guarantees that more than 290 million acres of U.S. farmland deliver returns for farmers regardless of the harvest.“For most people, this is a very new idea,” said Will Rodger, director of policy communications at the American Farm Bureau Federation. “We’re certainly aware that carbon can be stored in the soil, but farmers have very narrow margins. Many of our members are looking very closely at it, but the question is how to make it a business.”The U.S. Farmers & Ranchers Alliance proposed earlier this year that lenders find more creative financing models to help farmers employ regenerative practices. A study published this month in Nature Climate Change found that deploying land sector strategies like carbon farming, as well as food waste reduction and increasing plant-based diets, could turn farming into a net absorber of carbon as soon as 2050.Gore predicts that popular adoption of regenerative farming will someday take hold the same way residential solar and electric vehicles have caught on. “Farmers are doing this because they think it’s better for them,” Gore said. “I look for signs of hope.”To contact the author of this story: Emily Chasan in New York at echasan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: David Rovella at drovella@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fZi_K4S7kgMEpAkFCdczMg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/2f9b9b938ffcd69bb8fc199a89eedafd,Al Gore Is Opening a New Front In the War On Climate Change

"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:17:36 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/record-wave-lone-child-migrants-122133758.html,"TENOSIQUE, Mexico -- The United States has detained more children trying to cross the nation's southwest border on their own over the last year than during any other period on record, surpassing the surge of unaccompanied minors that set off a crisis during the Obama administration, according to new figures released Tuesday.U.S. immigration authorities apprehended 76,020 minors, most of them from Central America, traveling without their parents in the fiscal year that ended in September -- 52% more than during the last fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Mexico is experiencing the same surge. Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period -- pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.In interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous -- and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.""These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,"" Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters. ""And each month during the fiscal year, the numbers increased. You saw them. We all saw them.""The young migrants came alongside a historic wave of families traveling together, also largely from Central America. They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.Marvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced -- and he pressed on.""Quitting was not an option,"" Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. ""You wipe your tears and carry on.""For the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they'd kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.His parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said. ""We can't bear losing another son,"" they told him. ""You have to go.""He left home in the spring, with $40 in his pocket and no plan except to find work in a safer place.As for most underage migrants traveling without their parents, his trip north has been a feat of improvisation and courage. He walked and hitchhiked through Honduras and Guatemala. He slept in churches, under trees or wherever he found himself when night fell.Along the way, he gathered crucial bits of information from fellow migrants: the best route to take, locations of shelters up ahead, places to avoid, where to forage for food.As huge numbers of young migrants from Central America began arriving at the United States' southern border in 2014, the Obama administration scrambled to house them until they could be released to sponsors -- adults who applied to care for them. The shelter system grew dramatically as a result.The Trump administration experienced similar backups at the border just a few years later -- this time because of new, more stringent policies that made the sponsors themselves, who are often undocumented, vulnerable to immigration authorities. This discouraged people from coming forward, leaving thousands of children to languish in the system.The Trump administration has also sought to deter migration by separating thousands of children from their relatives, again driving up the number of children in federally contracted shelters.On the road, while trying to avoid detention, fear and hunger are constant companions for many young migrants.With little or no money in their pockets, they relied on strangers for snacks or meals. They pawed through garbage and scanned drifts of debris on the roadside, hoping to spot an edible morsel.Wilson, a 17-year-old Honduran, said he had feasted on rotten mangos discarded by street vendors.""I used to drink water from potholes when I was too thirsty,"" interjected Mario Leonel, 16, who left home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, several weeks ago without notifying his parents. ""That is the hardest part of it all: the hunger.""When he arrived at the shelter in Tenosique, a small Mexican town near the Guatemala border, he called his parents in Honduras, who burst into tears and pleaded for him to return. He said no. He was tired of all the violence in his country, and wanted to get asylum in the United States.After Marvel slipped across the Guatemala-Mexico border in May, he found room at a shelter in Tenosique, which serves as a transit point for many migrants. He quickly made new friends among other teenage migrants who had made it this far, mainly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador.On a recent afternoon, several of them gathered in a two-story building that had been reserved for minors, its walls painted with colorful animal murals. The boys cracked jokes, roughhoused and argued about who was the cutest girl in the shelter.Outside, Dulce, a 16-year-old transgender migrant from Guatemala, sat alone on train tracks pining for a boy she had met at the shelter. He had left without explanation and she was lovesick.""I just can't get him out of my mind,"" she said.She left her hometown four months earlier to escape abuse from her family and strangers, including a sexual assault by gang members when she was 12. She made it as far as central Mexico before being detained and deported. Five days after returning home, she set off again.""I left because I had nothing there and no one to protect me,"" she said. ""At least here I am safe.""Though the United States remains the destination of choice for most unaccompanied minors, an increasing number are setting their sights no farther than Mexico, advocates and migrants say.Sometimes they have no choice: Mexico's increased enforcement measures have made it more difficult for migrants to make it to the border with the United States. And even if they reach the United States, recent policies have drastically lowered the possibilities of getting asylum.In Mexico, when unaccompanied minors are detained, the law mandates that they be released right away into the custody of the national child protection agency, which finds them accommodation in shelters designed for children.But migrants' advocates say the government has been holding children in the nation's overcrowded detention centers for far too long, and that some children are quickly funneled into the deportation process rather than being given a fair chance to seek asylum or some other form of relief.""No child should ever be held at a detention center,"" said Elba Coria, a migration expert from the Clinic for Refugees at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City. ""But while international standards consider children's detention as an exceptional measure, amid Mexico's migration chaos, it is the rule.""Neither Marvel nor any of his new friends in the Tenosique shelter had been detained by the authorities. All had managed to cross into Mexico from Guatemala and had applied for asylum in Mexico after talking through their options with the shelter staff.They now plan to remain in Mexico and look for work and study opportunities -- even if they haven't abandoned hope of making it to the United States.""It is every Honduran's boy dream to get to the United States, where there is more money and kids are able to go to school,"" said Jose Angel, 17. He was born with a disability that left him unable to use his arms and left his hometown because his grandmother could no longer take care of him.He was hopeful he could apply for asylum in the United States despite Trump's many efforts to severely lower the number of people granted asylum. ""It is scary, but you have to take a chance,"" he said.On a recent morning, Alan, a 17-year-old Guatemalan migrant, sat on the sidewalk outside a migrant shelter in the city of Palenque, in southern Mexico. He had just crossed the border and was exhausted. Mexican immigration officials had stopped a bus he was on, but he managed to escape into the countryside and hide.Alan planned to take a nap, shower and have a meal before trying illegally to board a freight train known as The Beast. It runs from Mexico's border with Guatemala to its border with the United States and, for decades, migrants have clung to it to speed through much of Mexico.His hope was to make it to the U.S. border and petition for asylum. He was undeterred by Trump's recent efforts to restrict asylum claims or curb immigration.""One way or another, I have to make it to the other side where there are skyscrapers and life is better,"" he said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5ol82jExNHqBHa7IGzz2mw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/03f35d3f9d537a8dc9fe503d06c098de,"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation"

"Former &lt;/&gt;Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:11:25 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/former-time-editor-wants-hate-211125098.html,"A former Time editor claimed that the United States needs a law banning hate speech, and that President Donald Trump “might be in violation of it” if there were one -- because, apparently, he doesn’t notice the irony of holding both of these views at once.In a Tuesday tweet promoting his Washington Post piece, titled “Why America needs a hate speech law,” Richard Stengel stated:> My @WashingtonPost piece on why the very broadness of the First Amendment suggests we should have a hate speech law. And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f> > -- Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019In the piece, Stengel writes that “many nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred” in the wake of World War II:> These laws started out as protections against the kinds of anti-Semitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws, but there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general, hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.“I’m all for protecting ‘thought that we hate,’ but not speech that incites hate,” he continues. “It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.”It’s interesting how Stengel actually does acknowledge the fact that “there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is,” and yet he still wants laws banning it. This makes absolutely no sense. After all, when he calls for laws to ban “hate speech,” he is, inherently, giving the government the power to decide what would and would not qualify -- the exact same government that is led by Donald Trump, and that is full of people who support him.In other words: Stengel somehow trusts that the government will have the same view of “hate speech” as he does, and then, in the same thought, seems to acknowledge that there’s actually no way that many of them would. Unless he thinks that the president and his congressional supporters would actually pass a law that they’d be in violation of, his argument for “hate speech” laws winds up being a pretty great argument against them.It’s ironic, but it’s not new: More often than not, it’s the uber-progressives arguing for laws against “hate speech” -- despite the fact that they’re often the same people who are also arguing that Donald Trump and Republicans are constantly spewing it. Maybe it’s just me, but if I thought that the leader of my government was, you know, literally Hitler or whatever, the last thing that I’d want would be to give that person and their supporters control over my speech.Yes, the First Amendment gives us the right to be “offensive” with our speech. Given the fact that a new thing seems to be declared “racist” or “sexist” every day, I’m certainly glad that we do have this protection. After all, it would only take there being a few too many of the “super woke” in our government for a phrase like “you guys” to become a criminal offense.The truth is, though, the right to be “offensive” (however you define that subjective term, anyway) is not even the most important role that our First Amendment plays. No, what’s most important is that it protects our right to speak out against the government when we see fit -- without having to worry about its retaliation. Like it or not, the only way to ensure that we retain this important check on government power is to never (ever) give its leaders a vehicle take it away.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eTNessteMBpuBTcqmJGuYw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/bae9af12e23cce197b317b5c1be56053,"Former </>Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony"

Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 10:05:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-warren-untenable-plans-140521979.html,"If you’ve been having trouble finding someone to walk your dog, don’t worry. Any day now, Elizabeth Warren will announce “a plan for that.” It will undoubtedly be comprehensive, detailed, and replete with subsidies for lower- and middle-class dog walkers and underserved breeds. It will cost tens of billions of dollars and will receive widespread positive notice from the media. However, to judge by her other recent plans, the one thing it won’t include is any discussion of how she plans to pay for it.The Massachusetts senator has challenged and possibly overtaken former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, largely based on having a plan for the government to tackle every problem facing this country, no matter how big or how small, from issues with military housing to Puerto Rican debt to climate change.The price tag for this massive expansion of government is enormous. Much of the attention in recent weeks has been focused on Warren’s embrace of Medicare for All, which she refuses to admit would require an increase in middle-class taxes. Even Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has conceded that such proposals, which would cost $30–40 trillion over 10 years, cannot be financed without tax hikes. Warren’s refusal to address this obvious fact makes her look less like a would-be policy wonk and more like a typical politician.But even setting aside Medicare for All, Warren’s plans are likely to dump oceans of red ink onto our growing national debt. Her non-health-care spending proposals already total some $7.5 trillion per year over the next 10 years. Although these are not quite Bernie levels of government largesse, her proposals would still require nearly double our current levels of spending.To pay for all this, Warren proposes a variety of tax hikes, mostly designed to hit corporations or high-earners: higher payroll taxes for those earning more than $250,000 per year; a 7 percent profits tax on companies earning more than $100 million; a 60 percent lobbying tax on firms that spend a million or more on lobbying, and so forth. But the biggest chunk of money would come from Warren’s proposed “wealth tax,” a 2 to 3 percent levy on net worth above $50 million. Warren estimates that this wealth tax will pull in more than $2.75 trillion over ten years. It won’t.First, there is the slight problem that a wealth tax is probably unconstitutional. Of course, constitutional constraints are quaint notions in the Age of Trump. Regardless, it is worth noting that the Constitution permits the federal government to impose only “direct taxes,” such as a property tax. That’s why it required a constitutional amendment to enact the federal income tax. Many constitutional scholars warn that a wealth tax is neither a direct tax nor income tax.Even if Warren can find a way around the constitutional guardrails -- perhaps by something such as a retrospective wealth tax in which you wait until a taxpayer sells assets or passes away -- a wealth tax is unlikely to raise anywhere near the amount of money she predicts.Simply look at Europe’s experiments with wealth taxes. At one time, a dozen European countries imposed wealth taxes. Today, all but three have abandoned those levies. Among those repealing their wealth tax are the Scandinavian social democracies that Warren admires, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Norway retains a wealth tax but has significantly reduced it in recent years. Additional countries abandoning the tax include Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Other countries, such as Great Britain, have considered wealth taxes and rejected them.They did so because wealth taxes are administratively complex and difficult to enforce. Also, they significantly reduce investment, entrepreneurship, and, ultimately, economic growth. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, European wealth taxes raised, on average, only about 0.2 percent of GDP in revenues. By comparison, the U.S. federal income tax raises 8 percent of GDP.Two groups, however, would benefit substantially from a wealth tax. The tax would be a full-employment opportunity for the tax-preparation industry and for lawyers. After all, we would now have to determine fair market value for everything from homes and vehicles to artwork and jewelry to family pension rights and intellectual property. The other big winner would be lobbyists, who could be expected to descend on Washington en masse seeking exemptions and exceptions for their clients. If you think the tax code is a mess today, just wait until D.C. is done with Warren’s plan.There is an old Yiddish proverb that goes “Mann tracht, un Gott Lacht,” or “Man plans, and God laughs.” It is all well and good that Senator Warren has a plan for everything. But until she actually figures out how to pay for everything without crippling our economy, such plans really don’t add up.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/t_XOfhQ2Q8pn0Eihbaza4g--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/710b4188b8e44ebd02c332c03dfb8d66,Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans

Meghan McCain Spars With Cory Booker Over Civility: Beto Was ‘Very Nasty’ to Me!,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:39:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/meghan-mccain-spars-cory-booker-163901660.html,"During a Wednesday interview with Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, The View’s Meghan McCain did what she apparently does best: Make the conversation about herself and, in this case, her personal beef with a presidential hopeful.After applauding Booker for saying Medicare for All is unrealistic, the conservative View co-host took issue with the New Jersey senator’s support for mandatory gun buybacks. This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he’s going to take her brother’s guns.After a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they’d continue the conversation in the next segment.“No we’re not,” McCain grumbled. “It’s fine.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

How did we get there?”After noting that he lives near one of the fires in the Los Angeles area, Rubin immediately took aim at liberal politics as the main reason the wildfires have grown so large and dangerous.“The problem right now is that everything, EVERYTHING, from academia to public utilities to politics, everything that goes woke, that buys into this ridiculous progressive ideology that cares about what contractors are LGBT or how many black firemen we have or white this or Asian that, everything that goes that road eventually breaks down,” he declared.As Carlson nodded and said “that’s true,” Rubin continued, complaining that this isn’t how “freedom is supposed to operate.”“What is supposed to happen—imagine if your house was on fire,” he added. “Would you care what the public utility or what the fire company, what contractor they brought in, what gender or sexuality or any of those things he or she was? It’s just absolutely ridiculous.”The Fox News host continued to agree with Rubin, who went on to tie PG&E;’s preemptive blackouts to a lack of “libertarian or conservative-minded people in California to fight what the progressives are doing to the state.”“If you can’t keep the lights on and you can’t keep the place from burning down, you’ve reached the point where there is no kind of lying about it anymore,” Carlson concluded. “It’s falling apart.

"Former &lt;/&gt;Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:11:25 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/former-time-editor-wants-hate-211125098.html,"A former Time editor claimed that the United States needs a law banning hate speech, and that President Donald Trump “might be in violation of it” if there were one -- because, apparently, he doesn’t notice the irony of holding both of these views at once.In a Tuesday tweet promoting his Washington Post piece, titled “Why America needs a hate speech law,” Richard Stengel stated:> My @WashingtonPost piece on why the very broadness of the First Amendment suggests we should have a hate speech law. And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f> > -- Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019In the piece, Stengel writes that “many nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred” in the wake of World War II:> These laws started out as protections against the kinds of anti-Semitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws, but there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general, hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.“I’m all for protecting ‘thought that we hate,’ but not speech that incites hate,” he continues. “It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.”It’s interesting how Stengel actually does acknowledge the fact that “there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is,” and yet he still wants laws banning it. This makes absolutely no sense. After all, when he calls for laws to ban “hate speech,” he is, inherently, giving the government the power to decide what would and would not qualify -- the exact same government that is led by Donald Trump, and that is full of people who support him.In other words: Stengel somehow trusts that the government will have the same view of “hate speech” as he does, and then, in the same thought, seems to acknowledge that there’s actually no way that many of them would. Unless he thinks that the president and his congressional supporters would actually pass a law that they’d be in violation of, his argument for “hate speech” laws winds up being a pretty great argument against them.It’s ironic, but it’s not new: More often than not, it’s the uber-progressives arguing for laws against “hate speech” -- despite the fact that they’re often the same people who are also arguing that Donald Trump and Republicans are constantly spewing it. Maybe it’s just me, but if I thought that the leader of my government was, you know, literally Hitler or whatever, the last thing that I’d want would be to give that person and their supporters control over my speech.Yes, the First Amendment gives us the right to be “offensive” with our speech. Given the fact that a new thing seems to be declared “racist” or “sexist” every day, I’m certainly glad that we do have this protection. After all, it would only take there being a few too many of the “super woke” in our government for a phrase like “you guys” to become a criminal offense.The truth is, though, the right to be “offensive” (however you define that subjective term, anyway) is not even the most important role that our First Amendment plays. No, what’s most important is that it protects our right to speak out against the government when we see fit -- without having to worry about its retaliation. Like it or not, the only way to ensure that we retain this important check on government power is to never (ever) give its leaders a vehicle take it away.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eTNessteMBpuBTcqmJGuYw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/bae9af12e23cce197b317b5c1be56053,"Former </>Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony"

Al Gore Is Opening a New Front In the War On Climate Change,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 04:00:02 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/al-gore-makes-climate-case-080002432.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Al Gore’s 400-acre farm is located in Carthage, a small Tennessee town where the former vice president and senator traditionally kicked off his political campaigns. During his second act as a famous environmentalist, the farm became the site of a training program for aspiring climate activists, and more recently, an experiment in what Gore said is the world’s most realistic chance at averting climate catastrophe.Topsoil, the foot or so of ground underneath your feet, is responsible for almost all food production on Earth. It also stores more than three times as much carbon as forests. Today, agriculture is a net carbon emitter, contributing about 14% of all greenhouse gas emissions, but unlike power generation or automobiles, it can be turned into a net absorber, pulling carbon out of the atmosphere.If farming practices are changed through the use of cover crops, low-tilling and tree-planting, Gore said, agriculture conglomerates and family farmers alike could theoretically make their farms more productive while fighting global warming. Those changes can also replenish nutrients to the world’s soil, of which 33% has already been depleted.A virtuous circle if there ever was one—and one that’s already attracting attention from farmers, consumers and food companies.Gore, 71, is preaching the benefits of so-called carbon farming, a form of regenerative farming, at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump has been trying to roll back regulations meant to limit greenhouse gas emissions. And while science-based climate policy has been a prominent topic on the Democratic presidential campaign trail, it’s not always seen as a priority.Gore, who these days is more of a denim-wearing advocate than reserved technocrat, remains undeterred. His laboratory has been the farm where his parents once raised livestock and grew tobacco. Earlier this month, he invited 450 soil experts—farmers, scientists, chefs, food experts, entrepreneurs and investors—to join him there to discuss how to scale regenerative farming into something that might actually slow climate change.“We’ve waited so long to start to address the climate crisis,” Gore told those gathered. “We will need to both reduce emissions drastically and take as much carbon out of the atmosphere as we possibly can.”Unlike 2006, when Gore’s film “An Inconvenient Truth” was met with skepticism in some quarters, 13 years of intensifying storms, catastrophic floods and unprecedented droughts and wildfires have persuaded more Americans that there’s a very big problem. The goal now, Gore said, is to get people to start taking carbon farming seriously.When it comes to actually tackling what may soon become an existential crisis, the numbers are daunting. Trillions of dollars are needed to adapt civilization to the near-term consequences of climate change while tens of trillions of dollars are needed to slow its advance. But Gore said there are still too few plans to reverse global warming that don’t rely on technology that has yet to be developed.“Planting trees and sequestering carbon in soil are likely to remain the two most effective approaches,” Gore said in an interview at his Carthage farm. “There’s already some indication that farms that operate this way are more resilient in the face of climate extremes.”Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are at their highest in 3 million years. Oceans, the biggest carbon sinks of all, are acidifying because they hold too much of it. Plant life, which absorbs CO2 through photosynthesis, can sink carbon into the soil. Regenerative farming helps speed that along—with the added benefit of producing more nutrient-rich soil.Rattan Lal, a professor of soil physics and director of Ohio State University’s Carbon Management and Sequestration Center, is the key scientist behind Gore’s thinking. Lal served on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) when it shared a Nobel Prize with Gore in 2007, and was awarded the Japan Prize this year for his work on soil carbon sequestration.The world’s population currently uses more than a third of the planet’s surface for agriculture, according to the United Nations. In the U.S., close to 40% of land is farmland. Soil used for agriculture has degraded and eroded over centuries of use, losing between 20% and 60% of its original carbon content, according to the IPCC. Lal’s research shows that soil can sequester carbon at rates as high as 2.6 gigatons each year. An aggressive, global combination of tree planting and increased vegetation along with soil carbon sequestration, he said, has the “technical potential” to absorb 157 parts per million of CO2.With about 415 parts per million in the air today—a huge jump compared with a few decades ago—removing even a fraction of that could slow the advance of global warming.“There is virtually no analysis that shows the feasibility of doing any of this at scale.”Gore is realistic when it comes to the fraught politics of climate change and the policies that would need to align to make that potential possible. Moreover, carbon farming is a nascent concept in the U.S.: California has a growing program and Hawaii’s plan to become carbon neutral by 2045 includes a carbon farming framework. U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s “Green New Deal,” supported in some form by several Democratic presidential candidates, simply encourages farmers to improve soil health.But even without any legislation on the horizon, big agriculture is starting to pay attention.Eco-conscious shoppers are beginning to look for food farmed with regenerative practices, just as they do for organic products and sustainable packaging. General Mills set a goal in August to have 1 million acres in its supply chain transitioned to regenerative agriculture by 2030, and a group of companies including Danone North America and Unilever’s Ben & Jerry’s have been working on a certification for food farmed with regenerative practices.Not everyone is convinced its time has come, though. Timothy Searchinger, a research scholar at Princeton University who has studied the issue, said scalable carbon farming is still very much a pipe dream.“There is an unbelievable amount of scientific uncertainty,” Searchinger said. “There is virtually no analysis that shows the feasibility of doing any of this at scale.”Indeed, while there is some evidence that soil carbon can be rebuilt on degraded land, the technique requires putting so much nitrogen in the soil that the technique may not be viable in some places, he said. Additionally, many regenerative farmers discover that after a few years of no-till farming, their yields begin to fall. Searchinger said better options for achieving natural carbon sequestration at scale would be to focus on reducing deforestation and preserving peat lands.“It’s not the most useful thing to do in agriculture,” Searchinger said. While carbon farming would be helpful, he said the bigger agricultural climate issue is methane from livestock, something that might be addressed with feed additives.At its most basic, carbon farming is about leaving the ground alone. Simply plowing and tilling fields can disturb soil’s natural structure, releasing stored carbon into the atmosphere and displacing insects and microbes necessary for healthy soil. No-till farming creates fields that are better at acting like a sponge to absorb both water and carbon.Gore’s home state Tennessee leads the U.S. in no-till farming, with more than 78% of its farmland managed that way, versus 37% for the U.S., according to the Soil Health Institute. On his farm, some 10,000 trees have been planted to increase soil carbon. Small groups of cattle and sheep are rotated to graze in different areas, adding natural fertilizer to soils. The farm uses compost and cover crops to keep the soil healthy, rather than for their profit potential.Regenerative farming has more costs than traditional methods, especially upfront. Only about 108 million acres cross the U.S. are using some regenerative practices, according to Project Drawdown, a climate research group (as of 2012, the government said there were 914 million acres of farmland in America). The group estimates it would cost about $57 billion to convert another 1 billion acres by 2050, but that some 23.15 gigatons of CO2 could be sucked out of the atmosphere by doing so.While not a solution to the climate crisis by itself, Lal told the audience at Gore’s farm that regenerative farming could be, at the very least, “a bridge to the future.”Planting the same cash crops each year without rotating them tends to deplete nutrients from soil. Regenerative farming, meanwhile, results in more nutrient dense-crops. But most farmers don’t have any incentive to change what they are doing, because staples like wheat, rice, soybeans and corn are usually covered by federally-subsidized U.S. crop insurance—a $100 billion industry which currently guarantees that more than 290 million acres of U.S. farmland deliver returns for farmers regardless of the harvest.“For most people, this is a very new idea,” said Will Rodger, director of policy communications at the American Farm Bureau Federation. “We’re certainly aware that carbon can be stored in the soil, but farmers have very narrow margins. Many of our members are looking very closely at it, but the question is how to make it a business.”The U.S. Farmers & Ranchers Alliance proposed earlier this year that lenders find more creative financing models to help farmers employ regenerative practices. A study published this month in Nature Climate Change found that deploying land sector strategies like carbon farming, as well as food waste reduction and increasing plant-based diets, could turn farming into a net absorber of carbon as soon as 2050.Gore predicts that popular adoption of regenerative farming will someday take hold the same way residential solar and electric vehicles have caught on. “Farmers are doing this because they think it’s better for them,” Gore said. “I look for signs of hope.”To contact the author of this story: Emily Chasan in New York at echasan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: David Rovella at drovella@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fZi_K4S7kgMEpAkFCdczMg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/2f9b9b938ffcd69bb8fc199a89eedafd,Al Gore Is Opening a New Front In the War On Climate Change

Circuit for the U.S. Court of Appeals on Tuesday night halted the scheduled release of grand-jury materials from Robert Mueller’s investigation, just hours ahead of the scheduled distribution.The decision came after a federal judge ruled last Friday that the Justice Department must release unredacted material from the original Mueller investigation, a move House Democrats have clamored for in the midst of the ongoing impeachment inquiry.Judge Beryl Howell, an Obama appointee, wrote that the committee “has shown that it needs the grand jury material referenced and cited in the Mueller Report to avoid a possible injustice in the impeachment inquiry.”The DOJ contested Howell’s ruling and issued an emergency appeal, saying a quick release “threatens an irreparable loss of grand-jury secrecy before this court even has a chance to act on the Department’s stay motion.” The government also noted that Howell gave no explanation for her seemingly arbitrary deadline of Wednesday, which was not offered by Democrats.The three-judge D.C. panel — made up of judges appointed by Barack Obama — decided on an administrative stay in order “to give the court sufficient opportunity to consider the emergency motion for stay pending appeal and should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits of that motion,” according to the decision.The debate centers around the validity of redactions to a grand-jury deposition, which is usually kept secret. The DOJ argues that materials in the report are squarely protected by federal evidence regulations, while others point to ongoing criminal matters involved, including a probe by Connecticut U.S attorney John Durham the origins of the investigation.

"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:17:36 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/record-wave-lone-child-migrants-122133758.html,"TENOSIQUE, Mexico -- The United States has detained more children trying to cross the nation's southwest border on their own over the last year than during any other period on record, surpassing the surge of unaccompanied minors that set off a crisis during the Obama administration, according to new figures released Tuesday.U.S. immigration authorities apprehended 76,020 minors, most of them from Central America, traveling without their parents in the fiscal year that ended in September -- 52% more than during the last fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Mexico is experiencing the same surge. Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period -- pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.In interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous -- and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.""These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,"" Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters. ""And each month during the fiscal year, the numbers increased. You saw them. We all saw them.""The young migrants came alongside a historic wave of families traveling together, also largely from Central America. They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.Marvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced -- and he pressed on.""Quitting was not an option,"" Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. ""You wipe your tears and carry on.""For the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they'd kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.His parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said. ""We can't bear losing another son,"" they told him. ""You have to go.""He left home in the spring, with $40 in his pocket and no plan except to find work in a safer place.As for most underage migrants traveling without their parents, his trip north has been a feat of improvisation and courage. He walked and hitchhiked through Honduras and Guatemala. He slept in churches, under trees or wherever he found himself when night fell.Along the way, he gathered crucial bits of information from fellow migrants: the best route to take, locations of shelters up ahead, places to avoid, where to forage for food.As huge numbers of young migrants from Central America began arriving at the United States' southern border in 2014, the Obama administration scrambled to house them until they could be released to sponsors -- adults who applied to care for them. The shelter system grew dramatically as a result.The Trump administration experienced similar backups at the border just a few years later -- this time because of new, more stringent policies that made the sponsors themselves, who are often undocumented, vulnerable to immigration authorities. This discouraged people from coming forward, leaving thousands of children to languish in the system.The Trump administration has also sought to deter migration by separating thousands of children from their relatives, again driving up the number of children in federally contracted shelters.On the road, while trying to avoid detention, fear and hunger are constant companions for many young migrants.With little or no money in their pockets, they relied on strangers for snacks or meals. They pawed through garbage and scanned drifts of debris on the roadside, hoping to spot an edible morsel.Wilson, a 17-year-old Honduran, said he had feasted on rotten mangos discarded by street vendors.""I used to drink water from potholes when I was too thirsty,"" interjected Mario Leonel, 16, who left home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, several weeks ago without notifying his parents. ""That is the hardest part of it all: the hunger.""When he arrived at the shelter in Tenosique, a small Mexican town near the Guatemala border, he called his parents in Honduras, who burst into tears and pleaded for him to return. He said no. He was tired of all the violence in his country, and wanted to get asylum in the United States.After Marvel slipped across the Guatemala-Mexico border in May, he found room at a shelter in Tenosique, which serves as a transit point for many migrants. He quickly made new friends among other teenage migrants who had made it this far, mainly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador.On a recent afternoon, several of them gathered in a two-story building that had been reserved for minors, its walls painted with colorful animal murals. The boys cracked jokes, roughhoused and argued about who was the cutest girl in the shelter.Outside, Dulce, a 16-year-old transgender migrant from Guatemala, sat alone on train tracks pining for a boy she had met at the shelter. He had left without explanation and she was lovesick.""I just can't get him out of my mind,"" she said.She left her hometown four months earlier to escape abuse from her family and strangers, including a sexual assault by gang members when she was 12. She made it as far as central Mexico before being detained and deported. Five days after returning home, she set off again.""I left because I had nothing there and no one to protect me,"" she said. ""At least here I am safe.""Though the United States remains the destination of choice for most unaccompanied minors, an increasing number are setting their sights no farther than Mexico, advocates and migrants say.Sometimes they have no choice: Mexico's increased enforcement measures have made it more difficult for migrants to make it to the border with the United States. And even if they reach the United States, recent policies have drastically lowered the possibilities of getting asylum.In Mexico, when unaccompanied minors are detained, the law mandates that they be released right away into the custody of the national child protection agency, which finds them accommodation in shelters designed for children.But migrants' advocates say the government has been holding children in the nation's overcrowded detention centers for far too long, and that some children are quickly funneled into the deportation process rather than being given a fair chance to seek asylum or some other form of relief.""No child should ever be held at a detention center,"" said Elba Coria, a migration expert from the Clinic for Refugees at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City. ""But while international standards consider children's detention as an exceptional measure, amid Mexico's migration chaos, it is the rule.""Neither Marvel nor any of his new friends in the Tenosique shelter had been detained by the authorities. All had managed to cross into Mexico from Guatemala and had applied for asylum in Mexico after talking through their options with the shelter staff.They now plan to remain in Mexico and look for work and study opportunities -- even if they haven't abandoned hope of making it to the United States.""It is every Honduran's boy dream to get to the United States, where there is more money and kids are able to go to school,"" said Jose Angel, 17. He was born with a disability that left him unable to use his arms and left his hometown because his grandmother could no longer take care of him.He was hopeful he could apply for asylum in the United States despite Trump's many efforts to severely lower the number of people granted asylum. ""It is scary, but you have to take a chance,"" he said.On a recent morning, Alan, a 17-year-old Guatemalan migrant, sat on the sidewalk outside a migrant shelter in the city of Palenque, in southern Mexico. He had just crossed the border and was exhausted. Mexican immigration officials had stopped a bus he was on, but he managed to escape into the countryside and hide.Alan planned to take a nap, shower and have a meal before trying illegally to board a freight train known as The Beast. It runs from Mexico's border with Guatemala to its border with the United States and, for decades, migrants have clung to it to speed through much of Mexico.His hope was to make it to the U.S. border and petition for asylum. He was undeterred by Trump's recent efforts to restrict asylum claims or curb immigration.""One way or another, I have to make it to the other side where there are skyscrapers and life is better,"" he said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5ol82jExNHqBHa7IGzz2mw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/03f35d3f9d537a8dc9fe503d06c098de,"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation"

Congress Considers Delaying Spending Talks Until After Impeachment,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 15:47:15 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/congress-considers-delaying-spending-talks-194715001.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Democrats and Republicans in Congress are deliberating whether to push the deadline to fund the government into early February to avoid having a budget fight amid an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump that’s set to stretch at least into December.That would mean enacting another stopgap spending bill to avert a government shutdown when the current short-term funding runs out Nov. 21, assuming the two sides don’t be able to agree on a budget plan by then.Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby, a Republican, has floated the idea of a stopgap spending bill until February, though he said Wednesday he hasn’t discussed it with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.“I think that’s a pretty realistic assessment of where we are today,” said Shelby of Alabama. “Miracles do happen but I haven’t seen a lot of them around here.”House Democrats on the Appropriations Committee are also weighing a February stopgap, lawmakers and aides say.Trump’s insistence on funding a wall on the southern border is again hanging over funding decisions in Congress, as Democrats and Republicans negotiate 12 annual spending bills. An impasse over the border wall led to a 35-day partial government shutdown early this year. After it ended, Trump used emergency powers to raid military construction accounts to fund the wall.Wall MoneyWhen Shelby floated the idea of a stopgap bill until February, he said impeachment would “take the oxygen” out of the Capitol. But Democratic Representative David Price, a member of the Appropriations panel, said Trump’s continued demand for money to build a border wall is the problem.“Shelby can blame impeachment all he wants but it is their allocations that is standing in the way,” Price of North Carolina said. “If not for this wall issue we could get this done tomorrow.”House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are said to oppose a long stopgap in order to try to force a spending deal sooner. Hoyer wrote to McConnell on Tuesday to urge immediate talks on spending.Republicans want to replenish the $7 billion in military funds that Trump redirected toward construction of the border wall, and Democrats say they won’t refill those accounts without provisions to guard against future shifting of funds. Senate Republicans also are seeking $5 billion in new money for the wall.This already delicate negotiation is further complicated by the impeachment process that has enraged Trump and heightened partisan acrimony on Capitol Hill.Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer said Tuesday he was worried that Trump could use the Nov. 21 deadline to provoke a shutdown to distract from impeachment.”I’m increasingly worried that President Trump will want to shut down the government again because of impeachment,” Schumer said. “He always likes to create diversions.”Shutdown FearsRepublicans and Democrats in Congress say they don’t want another government shutdown, although they also said that when government funding ran out at the end of 2018. The Senate and the House, both led by the GOP at the time, were on the brink of a deal in December when Trump persuaded House Republicans to hold out for wall funding.The House has already passed its 12 appropriations bills, and the Senate this week is on track to pass a package of four spending bills that would fund Interior and Environment; Commerce, Justice and Science; Transportation, Housing and Urban Development; and Agriculture. This Senate measure would need to be reconciled with the House versions to become law.The most important thing for spending committee leaders is to agree on the topline allocation of spending for all government agencies. Senate Democrats say they’ll block debate on the annual Defense spending bill, the top GOP priority, until they reach a deal on total allocations.“This week will bring a litmus test: are Washington Democrats so concerned by impeachment that they cannot even fund our men and women in uniform?” McConnell said Tuesday. “It’s hard to imagine a more basic legislative responsibility than funding the Department of Defense.”\--With assistance from Jack Fitzpatrick.To contact the reporter on this story: Erik Wasson in Washington at ewasson@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Joe Sobczyk at jsobczyk@bloomberg.net, Laurie AsséoFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/M_gBixqUTKtNLood1HKdOQ--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/40fd63c8d0df90d81de4e3a310a07c72,Congress Considers Delaying Spending Talks Until After Impeachment

Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 10:05:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-warren-untenable-plans-140521979.html,"If you’ve been having trouble finding someone to walk your dog, don’t worry. Any day now, Elizabeth Warren will announce “a plan for that.” It will undoubtedly be comprehensive, detailed, and replete with subsidies for lower- and middle-class dog walkers and underserved breeds. It will cost tens of billions of dollars and will receive widespread positive notice from the media. However, to judge by her other recent plans, the one thing it won’t include is any discussion of how she plans to pay for it.The Massachusetts senator has challenged and possibly overtaken former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, largely based on having a plan for the government to tackle every problem facing this country, no matter how big or how small, from issues with military housing to Puerto Rican debt to climate change.The price tag for this massive expansion of government is enormous. Much of the attention in recent weeks has been focused on Warren’s embrace of Medicare for All, which she refuses to admit would require an increase in middle-class taxes. Even Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has conceded that such proposals, which would cost $30–40 trillion over 10 years, cannot be financed without tax hikes. Warren’s refusal to address this obvious fact makes her look less like a would-be policy wonk and more like a typical politician.But even setting aside Medicare for All, Warren’s plans are likely to dump oceans of red ink onto our growing national debt. Her non-health-care spending proposals already total some $7.5 trillion per year over the next 10 years. Although these are not quite Bernie levels of government largesse, her proposals would still require nearly double our current levels of spending.To pay for all this, Warren proposes a variety of tax hikes, mostly designed to hit corporations or high-earners: higher payroll taxes for those earning more than $250,000 per year; a 7 percent profits tax on companies earning more than $100 million; a 60 percent lobbying tax on firms that spend a million or more on lobbying, and so forth. But the biggest chunk of money would come from Warren’s proposed “wealth tax,” a 2 to 3 percent levy on net worth above $50 million. Warren estimates that this wealth tax will pull in more than $2.75 trillion over ten years. It won’t.First, there is the slight problem that a wealth tax is probably unconstitutional. Of course, constitutional constraints are quaint notions in the Age of Trump. Regardless, it is worth noting that the Constitution permits the federal government to impose only “direct taxes,” such as a property tax. That’s why it required a constitutional amendment to enact the federal income tax. Many constitutional scholars warn that a wealth tax is neither a direct tax nor income tax.Even if Warren can find a way around the constitutional guardrails -- perhaps by something such as a retrospective wealth tax in which you wait until a taxpayer sells assets or passes away -- a wealth tax is unlikely to raise anywhere near the amount of money she predicts.Simply look at Europe’s experiments with wealth taxes. At one time, a dozen European countries imposed wealth taxes. Today, all but three have abandoned those levies. Among those repealing their wealth tax are the Scandinavian social democracies that Warren admires, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Norway retains a wealth tax but has significantly reduced it in recent years. Additional countries abandoning the tax include Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Other countries, such as Great Britain, have considered wealth taxes and rejected them.They did so because wealth taxes are administratively complex and difficult to enforce. Also, they significantly reduce investment, entrepreneurship, and, ultimately, economic growth. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, European wealth taxes raised, on average, only about 0.2 percent of GDP in revenues. By comparison, the U.S. federal income tax raises 8 percent of GDP.Two groups, however, would benefit substantially from a wealth tax. The tax would be a full-employment opportunity for the tax-preparation industry and for lawyers. After all, we would now have to determine fair market value for everything from homes and vehicles to artwork and jewelry to family pension rights and intellectual property. The other big winner would be lobbyists, who could be expected to descend on Washington en masse seeking exemptions and exceptions for their clients. If you think the tax code is a mess today, just wait until D.C. is done with Warren’s plan.There is an old Yiddish proverb that goes “Mann tracht, un Gott Lacht,” or “Man plans, and God laughs.” It is all well and good that Senator Warren has a plan for everything. But until she actually figures out how to pay for everything without crippling our economy, such plans really don’t add up.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/t_XOfhQ2Q8pn0Eihbaza4g--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/710b4188b8e44ebd02c332c03dfb8d66,Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans
Meghan McCain Spars With Cory Booker Over Civility: Beto Was ‘Very Nasty’ to Me!,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:39:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/meghan-mccain-spars-cory-booker-163901660.html,"During a Wednesday interview with Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, The View’s Meghan McCain did what she apparently does best: Make the conversation about herself and, in this case, her personal beef with a presidential hopeful.After applauding Booker for saying Medicare for All is unrealistic, the conservative View co-host took issue with the New Jersey senator’s support for mandatory gun buybacks. This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he’s going to take her brother’s guns.After a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they’d continue the conversation in the next segment.“No we’re not,” McCain grumbled. “It’s fine.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

How did we get there?”After noting that he lives near one of the fires in the Los Angeles area, Rubin immediately took aim at liberal politics as the main reason the wildfires have grown so large and dangerous.“The problem right now is that everything, EVERYTHING, from academia to public utilities to politics, everything that goes woke, that buys into this ridiculous progressive ideology that cares about what contractors are LGBT or how many black firemen we have or white this or Asian that, everything that goes that road eventually breaks down,” he declared.As Carlson nodded and said “that’s true,” Rubin continued, complaining that this isn’t how “freedom is supposed to operate.”“What is supposed to happen—imagine if your house was on fire,” he added. “Would you care what the public utility or what the fire company, what contractor they brought in, what gender or sexuality or any of those things he or she was? It’s just absolutely ridiculous.”The Fox News host continued to agree with Rubin, who went on to tie PG&E;’s preemptive blackouts to a lack of “libertarian or conservative-minded people in California to fight what the progressives are doing to the state.”“If you can’t keep the lights on and you can’t keep the place from burning down, you’ve reached the point where there is no kind of lying about it anymore,” Carlson concluded. “It’s falling apart.

Circuit for the U.S. Court of Appeals on Tuesday night halted the scheduled release of grand-jury materials from Robert Mueller’s investigation, just hours ahead of the scheduled distribution.The decision came after a federal judge ruled last Friday that the Justice Department must release unredacted material from the original Mueller investigation, a move House Democrats have clamored for in the midst of the ongoing impeachment inquiry.Judge Beryl Howell, an Obama appointee, wrote that the committee “has shown that it needs the grand jury material referenced and cited in the Mueller Report to avoid a possible injustice in the impeachment inquiry.”The DOJ contested Howell’s ruling and issued an emergency appeal, saying a quick release “threatens an irreparable loss of grand-jury secrecy before this court even has a chance to act on the Department’s stay motion.” The government also noted that Howell gave no explanation for her seemingly arbitrary deadline of Wednesday, which was not offered by Democrats.The three-judge D.C. panel — made up of judges appointed by Barack Obama — decided on an administrative stay in order “to give the court sufficient opportunity to consider the emergency motion for stay pending appeal and should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits of that motion,” according to the decision.The debate centers around the validity of redactions to a grand-jury deposition, which is usually kept secret. The DOJ argues that materials in the report are squarely protected by federal evidence regulations, while others point to ongoing criminal matters involved, including a probe by Connecticut U.S attorney John Durham the origins of the investigation.

Al Gore Is Opening a New Front In the War On Climate Change,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 04:00:02 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/al-gore-makes-climate-case-080002432.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Al Gore’s 400-acre farm is located in Carthage, a small Tennessee town where the former vice president and senator traditionally kicked off his political campaigns. During his second act as a famous environmentalist, the farm became the site of a training program for aspiring climate activists, and more recently, an experiment in what Gore said is the world’s most realistic chance at averting climate catastrophe.Topsoil, the foot or so of ground underneath your feet, is responsible for almost all food production on Earth. It also stores more than three times as much carbon as forests. Today, agriculture is a net carbon emitter, contributing about 14% of all greenhouse gas emissions, but unlike power generation or automobiles, it can be turned into a net absorber, pulling carbon out of the atmosphere.If farming practices are changed through the use of cover crops, low-tilling and tree-planting, Gore said, agriculture conglomerates and family farmers alike could theoretically make their farms more productive while fighting global warming. Those changes can also replenish nutrients to the world’s soil, of which 33% has already been depleted.A virtuous circle if there ever was one—and one that’s already attracting attention from farmers, consumers and food companies.Gore, 71, is preaching the benefits of so-called carbon farming, a form of regenerative farming, at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump has been trying to roll back regulations meant to limit greenhouse gas emissions. And while science-based climate policy has been a prominent topic on the Democratic presidential campaign trail, it’s not always seen as a priority.Gore, who these days is more of a denim-wearing advocate than reserved technocrat, remains undeterred. His laboratory has been the farm where his parents once raised livestock and grew tobacco. Earlier this month, he invited 450 soil experts—farmers, scientists, chefs, food experts, entrepreneurs and investors—to join him there to discuss how to scale regenerative farming into something that might actually slow climate change.“We’ve waited so long to start to address the climate crisis,” Gore told those gathered. “We will need to both reduce emissions drastically and take as much carbon out of the atmosphere as we possibly can.”Unlike 2006, when Gore’s film “An Inconvenient Truth” was met with skepticism in some quarters, 13 years of intensifying storms, catastrophic floods and unprecedented droughts and wildfires have persuaded more Americans that there’s a very big problem. The goal now, Gore said, is to get people to start taking carbon farming seriously.When it comes to actually tackling what may soon become an existential crisis, the numbers are daunting. Trillions of dollars are needed to adapt civilization to the near-term consequences of climate change while tens of trillions of dollars are needed to slow its advance. But Gore said there are still too few plans to reverse global warming that don’t rely on technology that has yet to be developed.“Planting trees and sequestering carbon in soil are likely to remain the two most effective approaches,” Gore said in an interview at his Carthage farm. “There’s already some indication that farms that operate this way are more resilient in the face of climate extremes.”Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are at their highest in 3 million years. Oceans, the biggest carbon sinks of all, are acidifying because they hold too much of it. Plant life, which absorbs CO2 through photosynthesis, can sink carbon into the soil. Regenerative farming helps speed that along—with the added benefit of producing more nutrient-rich soil.Rattan Lal, a professor of soil physics and director of Ohio State University’s Carbon Management and Sequestration Center, is the key scientist behind Gore’s thinking. Lal served on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) when it shared a Nobel Prize with Gore in 2007, and was awarded the Japan Prize this year for his work on soil carbon sequestration.The world’s population currently uses more than a third of the planet’s surface for agriculture, according to the United Nations. In the U.S., close to 40% of land is farmland. Soil used for agriculture has degraded and eroded over centuries of use, losing between 20% and 60% of its original carbon content, according to the IPCC. Lal’s research shows that soil can sequester carbon at rates as high as 2.6 gigatons each year. An aggressive, global combination of tree planting and increased vegetation along with soil carbon sequestration, he said, has the “technical potential” to absorb 157 parts per million of CO2.With about 415 parts per million in the air today—a huge jump compared with a few decades ago—removing even a fraction of that could slow the advance of global warming.“There is virtually no analysis that shows the feasibility of doing any of this at scale.”Gore is realistic when it comes to the fraught politics of climate change and the policies that would need to align to make that potential possible. Moreover, carbon farming is a nascent concept in the U.S.: California has a growing program and Hawaii’s plan to become carbon neutral by 2045 includes a carbon farming framework. U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s “Green New Deal,” supported in some form by several Democratic presidential candidates, simply encourages farmers to improve soil health.But even without any legislation on the horizon, big agriculture is starting to pay attention.Eco-conscious shoppers are beginning to look for food farmed with regenerative practices, just as they do for organic products and sustainable packaging. General Mills set a goal in August to have 1 million acres in its supply chain transitioned to regenerative agriculture by 2030, and a group of companies including Danone North America and Unilever’s Ben & Jerry’s have been working on a certification for food farmed with regenerative practices.Not everyone is convinced its time has come, though. Timothy Searchinger, a research scholar at Princeton University who has studied the issue, said scalable carbon farming is still very much a pipe dream.“There is an unbelievable amount of scientific uncertainty,” Searchinger said. “There is virtually no analysis that shows the feasibility of doing any of this at scale.”Indeed, while there is some evidence that soil carbon can be rebuilt on degraded land, the technique requires putting so much nitrogen in the soil that the technique may not be viable in some places, he said. Additionally, many regenerative farmers discover that after a few years of no-till farming, their yields begin to fall. Searchinger said better options for achieving natural carbon sequestration at scale would be to focus on reducing deforestation and preserving peat lands.“It’s not the most useful thing to do in agriculture,” Searchinger said. While carbon farming would be helpful, he said the bigger agricultural climate issue is methane from livestock, something that might be addressed with feed additives.At its most basic, carbon farming is about leaving the ground alone. Simply plowing and tilling fields can disturb soil’s natural structure, releasing stored carbon into the atmosphere and displacing insects and microbes necessary for healthy soil. No-till farming creates fields that are better at acting like a sponge to absorb both water and carbon.Gore’s home state Tennessee leads the U.S. in no-till farming, with more than 78% of its farmland managed that way, versus 37% for the U.S., according to the Soil Health Institute. On his farm, some 10,000 trees have been planted to increase soil carbon. Small groups of cattle and sheep are rotated to graze in different areas, adding natural fertilizer to soils. The farm uses compost and cover crops to keep the soil healthy, rather than for their profit potential.Regenerative farming has more costs than traditional methods, especially upfront. Only about 108 million acres cross the U.S. are using some regenerative practices, according to Project Drawdown, a climate research group (as of 2012, the government said there were 914 million acres of farmland in America). The group estimates it would cost about $57 billion to convert another 1 billion acres by 2050, but that some 23.15 gigatons of CO2 could be sucked out of the atmosphere by doing so.While not a solution to the climate crisis by itself, Lal told the audience at Gore’s farm that regenerative farming could be, at the very least, “a bridge to the future.”Planting the same cash crops each year without rotating them tends to deplete nutrients from soil. Regenerative farming, meanwhile, results in more nutrient dense-crops. But most farmers don’t have any incentive to change what they are doing, because staples like wheat, rice, soybeans and corn are usually covered by federally-subsidized U.S. crop insurance—a $100 billion industry which currently guarantees that more than 290 million acres of U.S. farmland deliver returns for farmers regardless of the harvest.“For most people, this is a very new idea,” said Will Rodger, director of policy communications at the American Farm Bureau Federation. “We’re certainly aware that carbon can be stored in the soil, but farmers have very narrow margins. Many of our members are looking very closely at it, but the question is how to make it a business.”The U.S. Farmers & Ranchers Alliance proposed earlier this year that lenders find more creative financing models to help farmers employ regenerative practices. A study published this month in Nature Climate Change found that deploying land sector strategies like carbon farming, as well as food waste reduction and increasing plant-based diets, could turn farming into a net absorber of carbon as soon as 2050.Gore predicts that popular adoption of regenerative farming will someday take hold the same way residential solar and electric vehicles have caught on. “Farmers are doing this because they think it’s better for them,” Gore said. “I look for signs of hope.”To contact the author of this story: Emily Chasan in New York at echasan1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story: David Rovella at drovella@bloomberg.netFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fZi_K4S7kgMEpAkFCdczMg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/2f9b9b938ffcd69bb8fc199a89eedafd,Al Gore Is Opening a New Front In the War On Climate Change

"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:17:36 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/record-wave-lone-child-migrants-122133758.html,"TENOSIQUE, Mexico -- The United States has detained more children trying to cross the nation's southwest border on their own over the last year than during any other period on record, surpassing the surge of unaccompanied minors that set off a crisis during the Obama administration, according to new figures released Tuesday.U.S. immigration authorities apprehended 76,020 minors, most of them from Central America, traveling without their parents in the fiscal year that ended in September -- 52% more than during the last fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Mexico is experiencing the same surge. Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period -- pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.In interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous -- and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.""These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,"" Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters. ""And each month during the fiscal year, the numbers increased. You saw them. We all saw them.""The young migrants came alongside a historic wave of families traveling together, also largely from Central America. They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.Marvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced -- and he pressed on.""Quitting was not an option,"" Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. ""You wipe your tears and carry on.""For the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they'd kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.His parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said. ""We can't bear losing another son,"" they told him. ""You have to go.""He left home in the spring, with $40 in his pocket and no plan except to find work in a safer place.As for most underage migrants traveling without their parents, his trip north has been a feat of improvisation and courage. He walked and hitchhiked through Honduras and Guatemala. He slept in churches, under trees or wherever he found himself when night fell.Along the way, he gathered crucial bits of information from fellow migrants: the best route to take, locations of shelters up ahead, places to avoid, where to forage for food.As huge numbers of young migrants from Central America began arriving at the United States' southern border in 2014, the Obama administration scrambled to house them until they could be released to sponsors -- adults who applied to care for them. The shelter system grew dramatically as a result.The Trump administration experienced similar backups at the border just a few years later -- this time because of new, more stringent policies that made the sponsors themselves, who are often undocumented, vulnerable to immigration authorities. This discouraged people from coming forward, leaving thousands of children to languish in the system.The Trump administration has also sought to deter migration by separating thousands of children from their relatives, again driving up the number of children in federally contracted shelters.On the road, while trying to avoid detention, fear and hunger are constant companions for many young migrants.With little or no money in their pockets, they relied on strangers for snacks or meals. They pawed through garbage and scanned drifts of debris on the roadside, hoping to spot an edible morsel.Wilson, a 17-year-old Honduran, said he had feasted on rotten mangos discarded by street vendors.""I used to drink water from potholes when I was too thirsty,"" interjected Mario Leonel, 16, who left home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, several weeks ago without notifying his parents. ""That is the hardest part of it all: the hunger.""When he arrived at the shelter in Tenosique, a small Mexican town near the Guatemala border, he called his parents in Honduras, who burst into tears and pleaded for him to return. He said no. He was tired of all the violence in his country, and wanted to get asylum in the United States.After Marvel slipped across the Guatemala-Mexico border in May, he found room at a shelter in Tenosique, which serves as a transit point for many migrants. He quickly made new friends among other teenage migrants who had made it this far, mainly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador.On a recent afternoon, several of them gathered in a two-story building that had been reserved for minors, its walls painted with colorful animal murals. The boys cracked jokes, roughhoused and argued about who was the cutest girl in the shelter.Outside, Dulce, a 16-year-old transgender migrant from Guatemala, sat alone on train tracks pining for a boy she had met at the shelter. He had left without explanation and she was lovesick.""I just can't get him out of my mind,"" she said.She left her hometown four months earlier to escape abuse from her family and strangers, including a sexual assault by gang members when she was 12. She made it as far as central Mexico before being detained and deported. Five days after returning home, she set off again.""I left because I had nothing there and no one to protect me,"" she said. ""At least here I am safe.""Though the United States remains the destination of choice for most unaccompanied minors, an increasing number are setting their sights no farther than Mexico, advocates and migrants say.Sometimes they have no choice: Mexico's increased enforcement measures have made it more difficult for migrants to make it to the border with the United States. And even if they reach the United States, recent policies have drastically lowered the possibilities of getting asylum.In Mexico, when unaccompanied minors are detained, the law mandates that they be released right away into the custody of the national child protection agency, which finds them accommodation in shelters designed for children.But migrants' advocates say the government has been holding children in the nation's overcrowded detention centers for far too long, and that some children are quickly funneled into the deportation process rather than being given a fair chance to seek asylum or some other form of relief.""No child should ever be held at a detention center,"" said Elba Coria, a migration expert from the Clinic for Refugees at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City. ""But while international standards consider children's detention as an exceptional measure, amid Mexico's migration chaos, it is the rule.""Neither Marvel nor any of his new friends in the Tenosique shelter had been detained by the authorities. All had managed to cross into Mexico from Guatemala and had applied for asylum in Mexico after talking through their options with the shelter staff.They now plan to remain in Mexico and look for work and study opportunities -- even if they haven't abandoned hope of making it to the United States.""It is every Honduran's boy dream to get to the United States, where there is more money and kids are able to go to school,"" said Jose Angel, 17. He was born with a disability that left him unable to use his arms and left his hometown because his grandmother could no longer take care of him.He was hopeful he could apply for asylum in the United States despite Trump's many efforts to severely lower the number of people granted asylum. ""It is scary, but you have to take a chance,"" he said.On a recent morning, Alan, a 17-year-old Guatemalan migrant, sat on the sidewalk outside a migrant shelter in the city of Palenque, in southern Mexico. He had just crossed the border and was exhausted. Mexican immigration officials had stopped a bus he was on, but he managed to escape into the countryside and hide.Alan planned to take a nap, shower and have a meal before trying illegally to board a freight train known as The Beast. It runs from Mexico's border with Guatemala to its border with the United States and, for decades, migrants have clung to it to speed through much of Mexico.His hope was to make it to the U.S. border and petition for asylum. He was undeterred by Trump's recent efforts to restrict asylum claims or curb immigration.""One way or another, I have to make it to the other side where there are skyscrapers and life is better,"" he said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5ol82jExNHqBHa7IGzz2mw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/03f35d3f9d537a8dc9fe503d06c098de,"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation"

And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f> > -- Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019In the piece, Stengel writes that “many nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred” in the wake of World War II:> These laws started out as protections against the kinds of anti-Semitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws, but there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general, hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.“I’m all for protecting ‘thought that we hate,’ but not speech that incites hate,” he continues. “It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.”It’s interesting how Stengel actually does acknowledge the fact that “there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is,” and yet he still wants laws banning it. This makes absolutely no sense. After all, when he calls for laws to ban “hate speech,” he is, inherently, giving the government the power to decide what would and would not qualify -- the exact same government that is led by Donald Trump, and that is full of people who support him.In other words: Stengel somehow trusts that the government will have the same view of “hate speech” as he does, and then, in the same thought, seems to acknowledge that there’s actually no way that many of them would. Unless he thinks that the president and his congressional supporters would actually pass a law that they’d be in violation of, his argument for “hate speech” laws winds up being a pretty great argument against them.It’s ironic, but it’s not new: More often than not, it’s the uber-progressives arguing for laws against “hate speech” -- despite the fact that they’re often the same people who are also arguing that Donald Trump and Republicans are constantly spewing it. Maybe it’s just me, but if I thought that the leader of my government was, you know, literally Hitler or whatever, the last thing that I’d want would be to give that person and their supporters control over my speech.Yes, the First Amendment gives us the right to be “offensive” with our speech. Given the fact that a new thing seems to be declared “racist” or “sexist” every day, I’m certainly glad that we do have this protection. After all, it would only take there being a few too many of the “super woke” in our government for a phrase like “you guys” to become a criminal offense.The truth is, though, the right to be “offensive” (however you define that subjective term, anyway) is not even the most important role that our First Amendment plays. No, what’s most important is that it protects our right to speak out against the government when we see fit -- without having to worry about its retaliation. Like it or not, the only way to ensure that we retain this important check on government power is to never (ever) give its leaders a vehicle take it away.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eTNessteMBpuBTcqmJGuYw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/bae9af12e23cce197b317b5c1be56053,"Former </>Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony"

Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 10:05:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-warren-untenable-plans-140521979.html,"If you’ve been having trouble finding someone to walk your dog, don’t worry. Any day now, Elizabeth Warren will announce “a plan for that.” It will undoubtedly be comprehensive, detailed, and replete with subsidies for lower- and middle-class dog walkers and underserved breeds. It will cost tens of billions of dollars and will receive widespread positive notice from the media. However, to judge by her other recent plans, the one thing it won’t include is any discussion of how she plans to pay for it.The Massachusetts senator has challenged and possibly overtaken former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, largely based on having a plan for the government to tackle every problem facing this country, no matter how big or how small, from issues with military housing to Puerto Rican debt to climate change.The price tag for this massive expansion of government is enormous. Much of the attention in recent weeks has been focused on Warren’s embrace of Medicare for All, which she refuses to admit would require an increase in middle-class taxes. Even Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has conceded that such proposals, which would cost $30–40 trillion over 10 years, cannot be financed without tax hikes. Warren’s refusal to address this obvious fact makes her look less like a would-be policy wonk and more like a typical politician.But even setting aside Medicare for All, Warren’s plans are likely to dump oceans of red ink onto our growing national debt. Her non-health-care spending proposals already total some $7.5 trillion per year over the next 10 years. Although these are not quite Bernie levels of government largesse, her proposals would still require nearly double our current levels of spending.To pay for all this, Warren proposes a variety of tax hikes, mostly designed to hit corporations or high-earners: higher payroll taxes for those earning more than $250,000 per year; a 7 percent profits tax on companies earning more than $100 million; a 60 percent lobbying tax on firms that spend a million or more on lobbying, and so forth. But the biggest chunk of money would come from Warren’s proposed “wealth tax,” a 2 to 3 percent levy on net worth above $50 million. Warren estimates that this wealth tax will pull in more than $2.75 trillion over ten years. It won’t.First, there is the slight problem that a wealth tax is probably unconstitutional. Of course, constitutional constraints are quaint notions in the Age of Trump. Regardless, it is worth noting that the Constitution permits the federal government to impose only “direct taxes,” such as a property tax. That’s why it required a constitutional amendment to enact the federal income tax. Many constitutional scholars warn that a wealth tax is neither a direct tax nor income tax.Even if Warren can find a way around the constitutional guardrails -- perhaps by something such as a retrospective wealth tax in which you wait until a taxpayer sells assets or passes away -- a wealth tax is unlikely to raise anywhere near the amount of money she predicts.Simply look at Europe’s experiments with wealth taxes. At one time, a dozen European countries imposed wealth taxes. Today, all but three have abandoned those levies. Among those repealing their wealth tax are the Scandinavian social democracies that Warren admires, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Norway retains a wealth tax but has significantly reduced it in recent years. Additional countries abandoning the tax include Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Other countries, such as Great Britain, have considered wealth taxes and rejected them.They did so because wealth taxes are administratively complex and difficult to enforce. Also, they significantly reduce investment, entrepreneurship, and, ultimately, economic growth. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, European wealth taxes raised, on average, only about 0.2 percent of GDP in revenues. By comparison, the U.S. federal income tax raises 8 percent of GDP.Two groups, however, would benefit substantially from a wealth tax. The tax would be a full-employment opportunity for the tax-preparation industry and for lawyers. After all, we would now have to determine fair market value for everything from homes and vehicles to artwork and jewelry to family pension rights and intellectual property. The other big winner would be lobbyists, who could be expected to descend on Washington en masse seeking exemptions and exceptions for their clients. If you think the tax code is a mess today, just wait until D.C. is done with Warren’s plan.There is an old Yiddish proverb that goes “Mann tracht, un Gott Lacht,” or “Man plans, and God laughs.” It is all well and good that Senator Warren has a plan for everything. But until she actually figures out how to pay for everything without crippling our economy, such plans really don’t add up.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/t_XOfhQ2Q8pn0Eihbaza4g--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/710b4188b8e44ebd02c332c03dfb8d66,Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans
Meghan McCain Spars With Cory Booker Over Civility: Beto Was ‘Very Nasty’ to Me!,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:39:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/meghan-mccain-spars-cory-booker-163901660.html,"During a Wednesday interview with Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, The View’s Meghan McCain did what she apparently does best: Make the conversation about herself and, in this case, her personal beef with a presidential hopeful.After applauding Booker for saying Medicare for All is unrealistic, the conservative View co-host took issue with the New Jersey senator’s support for mandatory gun buybacks. This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he’s going to take her brother’s guns.After a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they’d continue the conversation in the next segment.“No we’re not,” McCain grumbled. “It’s fine.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Tucker Carlson and Guest Blame Diversity and ‘Woke’ Culture for California Fires,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 07:17:19 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/tucker-carlson-guest-blame-diversity-032855316.html,"Fox NewsFox News host Tucker Carlson and his guest, conservative YouTube personality Dave Rubin, both insisted Tuesday night that the wildfires burning across California are due largely to progressive ideology, “woke” culture, and diversity in hiring.During Tuesday’s broadcast of Tucker Carlson Tonight, Carlson welcomed on Rubin, a political commentator and podcaster, to discuss the issues surrounding the large fires engulfing the state, including those related to the electrical grid and firefighting methods.“PG&E; strikes me as almost a metaphor for the destruction of the state,” Carlson said about the state’s power company. “Here’s the utility which doesn’t really know anything about its own infrastructure but knows everything about the race of its employees. How did we get there?”After noting that he lives near one of the fires in the Los Angeles area, Rubin immediately took aim at liberal politics as the main reason the wildfires have grown so large and dangerous.“The problem right now is that everything, EVERYTHING, from academia to public utilities to politics, everything that goes woke, that buys into this ridiculous progressive ideology that cares about what contractors are LGBT or how many black firemen we have or white this or Asian that, everything that goes that road eventually breaks down,” he declared.As Carlson nodded and said “that’s true,” Rubin continued, complaining that this isn’t how “freedom is supposed to operate.”“What is supposed to happen—imagine if your house was on fire,” he added. “Would you care what the public utility or what the fire company, what contractor they brought in, what gender or sexuality or any of those things he or she was? It’s just absolutely ridiculous.”The Fox News host continued to agree with Rubin, who went on to tie PG&E;’s preemptive blackouts to a lack of “libertarian or conservative-minded people in California to fight what the progressives are doing to the state.”“If you can’t keep the lights on and you can’t keep the place from burning down, you’ve reached the point where there is no kind of lying about it anymore,” Carlson concluded. “It’s falling apart.

"Former &lt;/&gt;Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:11:25 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/former-time-editor-wants-hate-211125098.html,"A former Time editor claimed that the United States needs a law banning hate speech, and that President Donald Trump “might be in violation of it” if there were one -- because, apparently, he doesn’t notice the irony of holding both of these views at once.In a Tuesday tweet promoting his Washington Post piece, titled “Why America needs a hate speech law,” Richard Stengel stated:> My @WashingtonPost piece on why the very broadness of the First Amendment suggests we should have a hate speech law. And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f> > -- Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019In the piece, Stengel writes that “many nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred” in the wake of World War II:> These laws started out as protections against the kinds of anti-Semitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws, but there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general, hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.“I’m all for protecting ‘thought that we hate,’ but not speech that incites hate,” he continues. “It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.”It’s interesting how Stengel actually does acknowledge the fact that “there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is,” and yet he still wants laws banning it. This makes absolutely no sense. After all, when he calls for laws to ban “hate speech,” he is, inherently, giving the government the power to decide what would and would not qualify -- the exact same government that is led by Donald Trump, and that is full of people who support him.In other words: Stengel somehow trusts that the government will have the same view of “hate speech” as he does, and then, in the same thought, seems to acknowledge that there’s actually no way that many of them would. Unless he thinks that the president and his congressional supporters would actually pass a law that they’d be in violation of, his argument for “hate speech” laws winds up being a pretty great argument against them.It’s ironic, but it’s not new: More often than not, it’s the uber-progressives arguing for laws against “hate speech” -- despite the fact that they’re often the same people who are also arguing that Donald Trump and Republicans are constantly spewing it. Maybe it’s just me, but if I thought that the leader of my government was, you know, literally Hitler or whatever, the last thing that I’d want would be to give that person and their supporters control over my speech.Yes, the First Amendment gives us the right to be “offensive” with our speech. Given the fact that a new thing seems to be declared “racist” or “sexist” every day, I’m certainly glad that we do have this protection. After all, it would only take there being a few too many of the “super woke” in our government for a phrase like “you guys” to become a criminal offense.The truth is, though, the right to be “offensive” (however you define that subjective term, anyway) is not even the most important role that our First Amendment plays. No, what’s most important is that it protects our right to speak out against the government when we see fit -- without having to worry about its retaliation. Like it or not, the only way to ensure that we retain this important check on government power is to never (ever) give its leaders a vehicle take it away.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eTNessteMBpuBTcqmJGuYw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/bae9af12e23cce197b317b5c1be56053,"Former </>Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony"

"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:17:36 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/record-wave-lone-child-migrants-122133758.html,"TENOSIQUE, Mexico -- The United States has detained more children trying to cross the nation's southwest border on their own over the last year than during any other period on record, surpassing the surge of unaccompanied minors that set off a crisis during the Obama administration, according to new figures released Tuesday.U.S. immigration authorities apprehended 76,020 minors, most of them from Central America, traveling without their parents in the fiscal year that ended in September -- 52% more than during the last fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Mexico is experiencing the same surge. Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period -- pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.In interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous -- and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.""These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,"" Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters. ""And each month during the fiscal year, the numbers increased. You saw them. We all saw them.""The young migrants came alongside a historic wave of families traveling together, also largely from Central America. They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.Marvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced -- and he pressed on.""Quitting was not an option,"" Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. ""You wipe your tears and carry on.""For the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they'd kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.His parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said. ""We can't bear losing another son,"" they told him. ""You have to go.""He left home in the spring, with $40 in his pocket and no plan except to find work in a safer place.As for most underage migrants traveling without their parents, his trip north has been a feat of improvisation and courage. He walked and hitchhiked through Honduras and Guatemala. He slept in churches, under trees or wherever he found himself when night fell.Along the way, he gathered crucial bits of information from fellow migrants: the best route to take, locations of shelters up ahead, places to avoid, where to forage for food.As huge numbers of young migrants from Central America began arriving at the United States' southern border in 2014, the Obama administration scrambled to house them until they could be released to sponsors -- adults who applied to care for them. The shelter system grew dramatically as a result.The Trump administration experienced similar backups at the border just a few years later -- this time because of new, more stringent policies that made the sponsors themselves, who are often undocumented, vulnerable to immigration authorities. This discouraged people from coming forward, leaving thousands of children to languish in the system.The Trump administration has also sought to deter migration by separating thousands of children from their relatives, again driving up the number of children in federally contracted shelters.On the road, while trying to avoid detention, fear and hunger are constant companions for many young migrants.With little or no money in their pockets, they relied on strangers for snacks or meals. They pawed through garbage and scanned drifts of debris on the roadside, hoping to spot an edible morsel.Wilson, a 17-year-old Honduran, said he had feasted on rotten mangos discarded by street vendors.""I used to drink water from potholes when I was too thirsty,"" interjected Mario Leonel, 16, who left home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, several weeks ago without notifying his parents. ""That is the hardest part of it all: the hunger.""When he arrived at the shelter in Tenosique, a small Mexican town near the Guatemala border, he called his parents in Honduras, who burst into tears and pleaded for him to return. He said no. He was tired of all the violence in his country, and wanted to get asylum in the United States.After Marvel slipped across the Guatemala-Mexico border in May, he found room at a shelter in Tenosique, which serves as a transit point for many migrants. He quickly made new friends among other teenage migrants who had made it this far, mainly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador.On a recent afternoon, several of them gathered in a two-story building that had been reserved for minors, its walls painted with colorful animal murals. The boys cracked jokes, roughhoused and argued about who was the cutest girl in the shelter.Outside, Dulce, a 16-year-old transgender migrant from Guatemala, sat alone on train tracks pining for a boy she had met at the shelter. He had left without explanation and she was lovesick.""I just can't get him out of my mind,"" she said.She left her hometown four months earlier to escape abuse from her family and strangers, including a sexual assault by gang members when she was 12. She made it as far as central Mexico before being detained and deported. Five days after returning home, she set off again.""I left because I had nothing there and no one to protect me,"" she said. ""At least here I am safe.""Though the United States remains the destination of choice for most unaccompanied minors, an increasing number are setting their sights no farther than Mexico, advocates and migrants say.Sometimes they have no choice: Mexico's increased enforcement measures have made it more difficult for migrants to make it to the border with the United States. And even if they reach the United States, recent policies have drastically lowered the possibilities of getting asylum.In Mexico, when unaccompanied minors are detained, the law mandates that they be released right away into the custody of the national child protection agency, which finds them accommodation in shelters designed for children.But migrants' advocates say the government has been holding children in the nation's overcrowded detention centers for far too long, and that some children are quickly funneled into the deportation process rather than being given a fair chance to seek asylum or some other form of relief.""No child should ever be held at a detention center,"" said Elba Coria, a migration expert from the Clinic for Refugees at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City. ""But while international standards consider children's detention as an exceptional measure, amid Mexico's migration chaos, it is the rule.""Neither Marvel nor any of his new friends in the Tenosique shelter had been detained by the authorities. All had managed to cross into Mexico from Guatemala and had applied for asylum in Mexico after talking through their options with the shelter staff.They now plan to remain in Mexico and look for work and study opportunities -- even if they haven't abandoned hope of making it to the United States.""It is every Honduran's boy dream to get to the United States, where there is more money and kids are able to go to school,"" said Jose Angel, 17. He was born with a disability that left him unable to use his arms and left his hometown because his grandmother could no longer take care of him.He was hopeful he could apply for asylum in the United States despite Trump's many efforts to severely lower the number of people granted asylum. ""It is scary, but you have to take a chance,"" he said.On a recent morning, Alan, a 17-year-old Guatemalan migrant, sat on the sidewalk outside a migrant shelter in the city of Palenque, in southern Mexico. He had just crossed the border and was exhausted. Mexican immigration officials had stopped a bus he was on, but he managed to escape into the countryside and hide.Alan planned to take a nap, shower and have a meal before trying illegally to board a freight train known as The Beast. It runs from Mexico's border with Guatemala to its border with the United States and, for decades, migrants have clung to it to speed through much of Mexico.His hope was to make it to the U.S. border and petition for asylum. He was undeterred by Trump's recent efforts to restrict asylum claims or curb immigration.""One way or another, I have to make it to the other side where there are skyscrapers and life is better,"" he said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5ol82jExNHqBHa7IGzz2mw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/03f35d3f9d537a8dc9fe503d06c098de,"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation"

Circuit for the U.S. Court of Appeals on Tuesday night halted the scheduled release of grand-jury materials from Robert Mueller’s investigation, just hours ahead of the scheduled distribution.The decision came after a federal judge ruled last Friday that the Justice Department must release unredacted material from the original Mueller investigation, a move House Democrats have clamored for in the midst of the ongoing impeachment inquiry.Judge Beryl Howell, an Obama appointee, wrote that the committee “has shown that it needs the grand jury material referenced and cited in the Mueller Report to avoid a possible injustice in the impeachment inquiry.”The DOJ contested Howell’s ruling and issued an emergency appeal, saying a quick release “threatens an irreparable loss of grand-jury secrecy before this court even has a chance to act on the Department’s stay motion.” The government also noted that Howell gave no explanation for her seemingly arbitrary deadline of Wednesday, which was not offered by Democrats.The three-judge D.C. panel — made up of judges appointed by Barack Obama — decided on an administrative stay in order “to give the court sufficient opportunity to consider the emergency motion for stay pending appeal and should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits of that motion,” according to the decision.The debate centers around the validity of redactions to a grand-jury deposition, which is usually kept secret. The DOJ argues that materials in the report are squarely protected by federal evidence regulations, while others point to ongoing criminal matters involved, including a probe by Connecticut U.S attorney John Durham the origins of the investigation. House Democrats counter that secrecy rules do not apply to the impeachment inquiry, which is a judicial proceeding.",http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/w_heEZnk1hoDQSTVWqjVSg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/5cc14c5df368875c0317fc539bb227fd,D.C.

Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 10:05:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-warren-untenable-plans-140521979.html,"If you’ve been having trouble finding someone to walk your dog, don’t worry. Any day now, Elizabeth Warren will announce “a plan for that.” It will undoubtedly be comprehensive, detailed, and replete with subsidies for lower- and middle-class dog walkers and underserved breeds. It will cost tens of billions of dollars and will receive widespread positive notice from the media. However, to judge by her other recent plans, the one thing it won’t include is any discussion of how she plans to pay for it.The Massachusetts senator has challenged and possibly overtaken former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, largely based on having a plan for the government to tackle every problem facing this country, no matter how big or how small, from issues with military housing to Puerto Rican debt to climate change.The price tag for this massive expansion of government is enormous. Much of the attention in recent weeks has been focused on Warren’s embrace of Medicare for All, which she refuses to admit would require an increase in middle-class taxes. Even Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has conceded that such proposals, which would cost $30–40 trillion over 10 years, cannot be financed without tax hikes. Warren’s refusal to address this obvious fact makes her look less like a would-be policy wonk and more like a typical politician.But even setting aside Medicare for All, Warren’s plans are likely to dump oceans of red ink onto our growing national debt. Her non-health-care spending proposals already total some $7.5 trillion per year over the next 10 years. Although these are not quite Bernie levels of government largesse, her proposals would still require nearly double our current levels of spending.To pay for all this, Warren proposes a variety of tax hikes, mostly designed to hit corporations or high-earners: higher payroll taxes for those earning more than $250,000 per year; a 7 percent profits tax on companies earning more than $100 million; a 60 percent lobbying tax on firms that spend a million or more on lobbying, and so forth. But the biggest chunk of money would come from Warren’s proposed “wealth tax,” a 2 to 3 percent levy on net worth above $50 million. Warren estimates that this wealth tax will pull in more than $2.75 trillion over ten years. It won’t.First, there is the slight problem that a wealth tax is probably unconstitutional. Of course, constitutional constraints are quaint notions in the Age of Trump. Regardless, it is worth noting that the Constitution permits the federal government to impose only “direct taxes,” such as a property tax. That’s why it required a constitutional amendment to enact the federal income tax. Many constitutional scholars warn that a wealth tax is neither a direct tax nor income tax.Even if Warren can find a way around the constitutional guardrails -- perhaps by something such as a retrospective wealth tax in which you wait until a taxpayer sells assets or passes away -- a wealth tax is unlikely to raise anywhere near the amount of money she predicts.Simply look at Europe’s experiments with wealth taxes. At one time, a dozen European countries imposed wealth taxes. Today, all but three have abandoned those levies. Among those repealing their wealth tax are the Scandinavian social democracies that Warren admires, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Norway retains a wealth tax but has significantly reduced it in recent years. Additional countries abandoning the tax include Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Other countries, such as Great Britain, have considered wealth taxes and rejected them.They did so because wealth taxes are administratively complex and difficult to enforce. Also, they significantly reduce investment, entrepreneurship, and, ultimately, economic growth. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, European wealth taxes raised, on average, only about 0.2 percent of GDP in revenues. By comparison, the U.S. federal income tax raises 8 percent of GDP.Two groups, however, would benefit substantially from a wealth tax. The tax would be a full-employment opportunity for the tax-preparation industry and for lawyers. After all, we would now have to determine fair market value for everything from homes and vehicles to artwork and jewelry to family pension rights and intellectual property. The other big winner would be lobbyists, who could be expected to descend on Washington en masse seeking exemptions and exceptions for their clients.

Meghan McCain Spars With Cory Booker Over Civility: Beto Was ‘Very Nasty’ to Me!,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:39:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/meghan-mccain-spars-cory-booker-163901660.html,"During a Wednesday interview with Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, The View’s Meghan McCain did what she apparently does best: Make the conversation about herself and, in this case, her personal beef with a presidential hopeful.After applauding Booker for saying Medicare for All is unrealistic, the conservative View co-host took issue with the New Jersey senator’s support for mandatory gun buybacks. This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he’s going to take her brother’s guns.After a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they’d continue the conversation in the next segment.“No we’re not,” McCain grumbled. “It’s fine.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

How did we get there?”After noting that he lives near one of the fires in the Los Angeles area, Rubin immediately took aim at liberal politics as the main reason the wildfires have grown so large and dangerous.“The problem right now is that everything, EVERYTHING, from academia to public utilities to politics, everything that goes woke, that buys into this ridiculous progressive ideology that cares about what contractors are LGBT or how many black firemen we have or white this or Asian that, everything that goes that road eventually breaks down,” he declared.As Carlson nodded and said “that’s true,” Rubin continued, complaining that this isn’t how “freedom is supposed to operate.”“What is supposed to happen—imagine if your house was on fire,” he added. “Would you care what the public utility or what the fire company, what contractor they brought in, what gender or sexuality or any of those things he or she was? It’s just absolutely ridiculous.”The Fox News host continued to agree with Rubin, who went on to tie PG&E;’s preemptive blackouts to a lack of “libertarian or conservative-minded people in California to fight what the progressives are doing to the state.”“If you can’t keep the lights on and you can’t keep the place from burning down, you’ve reached the point where there is no kind of lying about it anymore,” Carlson concluded. “It’s falling apart.

"Former &lt;/&gt;Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:11:25 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/former-time-editor-wants-hate-211125098.html,"A former Time editor claimed that the United States needs a law banning hate speech, and that President Donald Trump “might be in violation of it” if there were one -- because, apparently, he doesn’t notice the irony of holding both of these views at once.In a Tuesday tweet promoting his Washington Post piece, titled “Why America needs a hate speech law,” Richard Stengel stated:> My @WashingtonPost piece on why the very broadness of the First Amendment suggests we should have a hate speech law. And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f> > -- Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019In the piece, Stengel writes that “many nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred” in the wake of World War II:> These laws started out as protections against the kinds of anti-Semitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws, but there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general, hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.“I’m all for protecting ‘thought that we hate,’ but not speech that incites hate,” he continues. “It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.”It’s interesting how Stengel actually does acknowledge the fact that “there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is,” and yet he still wants laws banning it. This makes absolutely no sense. After all, when he calls for laws to ban “hate speech,” he is, inherently, giving the government the power to decide what would and would not qualify -- the exact same government that is led by Donald Trump, and that is full of people who support him.In other words: Stengel somehow trusts that the government will have the same view of “hate speech” as he does, and then, in the same thought, seems to acknowledge that there’s actually no way that many of them would. Unless he thinks that the president and his congressional supporters would actually pass a law that they’d be in violation of, his argument for “hate speech” laws winds up being a pretty great argument against them.It’s ironic, but it’s not new: More often than not, it’s the uber-progressives arguing for laws against “hate speech” -- despite the fact that they’re often the same people who are also arguing that Donald Trump and Republicans are constantly spewing it. Maybe it’s just me, but if I thought that the leader of my government was, you know, literally Hitler or whatever, the last thing that I’d want would be to give that person and their supporters control over my speech.Yes, the First Amendment gives us the right to be “offensive” with our speech. Given the fact that a new thing seems to be declared “racist” or “sexist” every day, I’m certainly glad that we do have this protection. After all, it would only take there being a few too many of the “super woke” in our government for a phrase like “you guys” to become a criminal offense.The truth is, though, the right to be “offensive” (however you define that subjective term, anyway) is not even the most important role that our First Amendment plays. No, what’s most important is that it protects our right to speak out against the government when we see fit -- without having to worry about its retaliation. Like it or not, the only way to ensure that we retain this important check on government power is to never (ever) give its leaders a vehicle take it away.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eTNessteMBpuBTcqmJGuYw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/bae9af12e23cce197b317b5c1be56053,"Former </>Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony"

"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:17:36 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/record-wave-lone-child-migrants-122133758.html,"TENOSIQUE, Mexico -- The United States has detained more children trying to cross the nation's southwest border on their own over the last year than during any other period on record, surpassing the surge of unaccompanied minors that set off a crisis during the Obama administration, according to new figures released Tuesday.U.S. immigration authorities apprehended 76,020 minors, most of them from Central America, traveling without their parents in the fiscal year that ended in September -- 52% more than during the last fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Mexico is experiencing the same surge. Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period -- pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.In interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous -- and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.""These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,"" Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters. ""And each month during the fiscal year, the numbers increased. You saw them. We all saw them.""The young migrants came alongside a historic wave of families traveling together, also largely from Central America. They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.Marvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced -- and he pressed on.""Quitting was not an option,"" Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. ""You wipe your tears and carry on.""For the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they'd kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.His parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said. ""We can't bear losing another son,"" they told him.

D.C. Panel Halts Release of Mueller Documents at DOJ’s Request,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 09:02:23 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/d-c-panel-halts-release-130223421.html,"The D.C. Circuit for the U.S. Court of Appeals on Tuesday night halted the scheduled release of grand-jury materials from Robert Mueller’s investigation, just hours ahead of the scheduled distribution.The decision came after a federal judge ruled last Friday that the Justice Department must release unredacted material from the original Mueller investigation, a move House Democrats have clamored for in the midst of the ongoing impeachment inquiry.Judge Beryl Howell, an Obama appointee, wrote that the committee “has shown that it needs the grand jury material referenced and cited in the Mueller Report to avoid a possible injustice in the impeachment inquiry.”The DOJ contested Howell’s ruling and issued an emergency appeal, saying a quick release “threatens an irreparable loss of grand-jury secrecy before this court even has a chance to act on the Department’s stay motion.” The government also noted that Howell gave no explanation for her seemingly arbitrary deadline of Wednesday, which was not offered by Democrats.The three-judge D.C. panel — made up of judges appointed by Barack Obama — decided on an administrative stay in order “to give the court sufficient opportunity to consider the emergency motion for stay pending appeal and should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits of that motion,” according to the decision.The debate centers around the validity of redactions to a grand-jury deposition, which is usually kept secret. The DOJ argues that materials in the report are squarely protected by federal evidence regulations, while others point to ongoing criminal matters involved, including a probe by Connecticut U.S attorney John Durham the origins of the investigation. House Democrats counter that secrecy rules do not apply to the impeachment inquiry, which is a judicial proceeding.",http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/w_heEZnk1hoDQSTVWqjVSg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/5cc14c5df368875c0317fc539bb227fd,D.C.

How Boris Johnson’s Brexit Election Gamble Could Backfire,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 01:00:00 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/boris-johnsons-brexit-election-gamble-050000800.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Sign up to our Brexit Bulletin, follow us @Brexit and subscribe to our podcast.Boris Johnson has succeeded, finally, in getting Parliament to give him the general election that he wants. The polls have him far ahead: YouGov had 36% of voters backing his Conservatives, with Labour in second place on 23%. But his move is still a risky one. Here are the ways it could go wrong.Polling ErrorRemember the 2015 U.K. election shock? And the 2016 Brexit referendum shock? And the 2017 U.K. election shock? A common feature of all of them was a failure of the polling companies to properly detect a shift in public opinion.At the very time that we want faster, better data from them, pollsters face unprecedented challenges. In particular, they struggle to reach younger, more mobile voters, those who might be expected to oppose Johnson’s Conservatives and Brexit.Votes vs SeatsEven if the pollsters get close with the total vote share, translating it into the thing that matters, seats in Parliament, is very hard. Votes can pile up unevenly. In 2017, the Tories won 42% of the vote, but 49% of the seats. Labour won 40% of both.Tory FatigueThe Conservatives have now been in power for nine years, and even Cabinet ministers acknowledge privately that the last three of those years haven’t been a great advertisement for Tory government. The party’s recent discovery of unity behind Johnson might not outweigh years of infighting and indecision.Hard TimesIt’s not just that the Tories have been in power for a long time, they’ve been in power for a long time while people haven’t got any richer. According to the Office for National Statistics, median weekly earnings are still 2.9% below their 2008 level. That’s not a great backdrop for an election.Brexit FactorJohnson’s slogan, “Get Brexit Done,” feels like an appealing message to a public weary of months of knife-edge votes and reverses. But it’s also an admission that this government has had a single project since 2016, has failed to deliver on it, and everyone is sick of waiting.Johnson hopes to turn that frustration into votes for Conservatives. But voters could conclude that Brexit was a Conservative project -- a Johnson project, in fact -- and that if they’re tired of it, they need someone different in charge.The failure to complete the U.K.’s withdrawal from the EU also leaves the door open to Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party to take votes away from the Tories. If Farage does well enough to stop Tories winning key seats, Corbyn could ultimately benefit.Money’s TightJohnson’s other message is that by getting Brexit dealt with, he will be able to focus on spending money on things people do like, such as schools and hospitals. This too is an admission of failure.After nine years of spending restrictions, Britain’s public services are squeezed: libraries are closing, knife crime is rising, numbers of rough sleepers are increasing. Labour will be very happy to fight an election on the question of who is better at spending money on things.Character FlawsThe Conservatives are pinning a lot of their hopes on Johnson’s undoubted fame. Unlike his predecessor Theresa May, he enjoys campaigning. But that fame brings a problem. Most people have made up their minds what they think of Johnson, and a lot of them don’t like him.According to YouGov, 47% of people have a negative opinion of him, against 33% who have a positive one. Labour is pushing hard on Johnson’s tendency to go back on promises.The Conservatives, too, plan to make much of their opponent’s character: Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has even worse scores than Johnson: 58% negative, against 23% positive. But at the last election, Corbyn was able to shrug off criticism of his past statements.Mixed MessagesJohnson risks losing a whole load of Conservative seats in places that don’t like Brexit too: southern England, and Scotland. According to Joe Twyman of Deltapoll, that leaves the prime minister trying to pull off a difficult trick.“He needs to convince Remain-leaning Conservative voters to forget Brexit and vote Conservative,” Twyman said. “At the same time convince Leave-leaning Labour voters to hold their noses about him and vote for Brexit.”Right Votes, Wrong PlacesA different version of the same problem is that the Conservatives’ strongly pro-Brexit message helps them do very well in areas they already hold. According to Twyman, of the 50 most “Leave” areas, 24 are already Conservative. Extra votes there don’t help.Accidents HappenConservative politicians are fond of saying that they’ll never run a campaign as bad as the one May ran in 2017. In particular they point to her announcement of a plan to fund care for the elderly from the value of their houses.But things can go wrong. The 2017 campaign was interrupted by terrorist attacks. Johnson could find himself unexpectedly tested. He may be just about the only politician known to everyone by his first name, but he’s also the only one to have had to apologize to an entire city -- Liverpool, in 2004.His team have been keen to keep him away from difficult questions. In the intense scrutiny of an election campaign, that will be harder than ever.To contact the reporter on this story: Robert Hutton in London at rhutton1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tim Ross at tross54@bloomberg.net, Flavia Krause-JacksonFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/G.m4foP92eZpAREH7SCSgw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/d711bd17f3966d5753a56a0bf2e986dd,How Boris Johnson’s Brexit Election Gamble Could Backfire

"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:17:36 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/record-wave-lone-child-migrants-122133758.html,"TENOSIQUE, Mexico -- The United States has detained more children trying to cross the nation's southwest border on their own over the last year than during any other period on record, surpassing the surge of unaccompanied minors that set off a crisis during the Obama administration, according to new figures released Tuesday.U.S. immigration authorities apprehended 76,020 minors, most of them from Central America, traveling without their parents in the fiscal year that ended in September -- 52% more than during the last fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Mexico is experiencing the same surge. Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period -- pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.In interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous -- and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.""These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,"" Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters. ""And each month during the fiscal year, the numbers increased. You saw them. We all saw them.""The young migrants came alongside a historic wave of families traveling together, also largely from Central America. They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.Marvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced -- and he pressed on.""Quitting was not an option,"" Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. ""You wipe your tears and carry on.""For the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they'd kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.His parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said.

Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 10:05:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-warren-untenable-plans-140521979.html,"If you’ve been having trouble finding someone to walk your dog, don’t worry. Any day now, Elizabeth Warren will announce “a plan for that.” It will undoubtedly be comprehensive, detailed, and replete with subsidies for lower- and middle-class dog walkers and underserved breeds. It will cost tens of billions of dollars and will receive widespread positive notice from the media. However, to judge by her other recent plans, the one thing it won’t include is any discussion of how she plans to pay for it.The Massachusetts senator has challenged and possibly overtaken former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, largely based on having a plan for the government to tackle every problem facing this country, no matter how big or how small, from issues with military housing to Puerto Rican debt to climate change.The price tag for this massive expansion of government is enormous. Much of the attention in recent weeks has been focused on Warren’s embrace of Medicare for All, which she refuses to admit would require an increase in middle-class taxes. Even Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has conceded that such proposals, which would cost $30–40 trillion over 10 years, cannot be financed without tax hikes. Warren’s refusal to address this obvious fact makes her look less like a would-be policy wonk and more like a typical politician.But even setting aside Medicare for All, Warren’s plans are likely to dump oceans of red ink onto our growing national debt. Her non-health-care spending proposals already total some $7.5 trillion per year over the next 10 years. Although these are not quite Bernie levels of government largesse, her proposals would still require nearly double our current levels of spending.To pay for all this, Warren proposes a variety of tax hikes, mostly designed to hit corporations or high-earners: higher payroll taxes for those earning more than $250,000 per year; a 7 percent profits tax on companies earning more than $100 million; a 60 percent lobbying tax on firms that spend a million or more on lobbying, and so forth. But the biggest chunk of money would come from Warren’s proposed “wealth tax,” a 2 to 3 percent levy on net worth above $50 million. Warren estimates that this wealth tax will pull in more than $2.75 trillion over ten years. It won’t.First, there is the slight problem that a wealth tax is probably unconstitutional. Of course, constitutional constraints are quaint notions in the Age of Trump. Regardless, it is worth noting that the Constitution permits the federal government to impose only “direct taxes,” such as a property tax. That’s why it required a constitutional amendment to enact the federal income tax. Many constitutional scholars warn that a wealth tax is neither a direct tax nor income tax.Even if Warren can find a way around the constitutional guardrails -- perhaps by something such as a retrospective wealth tax in which you wait until a taxpayer sells assets or passes away -- a wealth tax is unlikely to raise anywhere near the amount of money she predicts.Simply look at Europe’s experiments with wealth taxes. At one time, a dozen European countries imposed wealth taxes. Today, all but three have abandoned those levies. Among those repealing their wealth tax are the Scandinavian social democracies that Warren admires, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Norway retains a wealth tax but has significantly reduced it in recent years. Additional countries abandoning the tax include Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Other countries, such as Great Britain, have considered wealth taxes and rejected them.They did so because wealth taxes are administratively complex and difficult to enforce. Also, they significantly reduce investment, entrepreneurship, and, ultimately, economic growth. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, European wealth taxes raised, on average, only about 0.2 percent of GDP in revenues. By comparison, the U.S. federal income tax raises 8 percent of GDP.Two groups, however, would benefit substantially from a wealth tax. The tax would be a full-employment opportunity for the tax-preparation industry and for lawyers. After all, we would now have to determine fair market value for everything from homes and vehicles to artwork and jewelry to family pension rights and intellectual property. The other big winner would be lobbyists, who could be expected to descend on Washington en masse seeking exemptions and exceptions for their clients. If you think the tax code is a mess today, just wait until D.C. is done with Warren’s plan.There is an old Yiddish proverb that goes “Mann tracht, un Gott Lacht,” or “Man plans, and God laughs.” It is all well and good that Senator Warren has a plan for everything. But until she actually figures out how to pay for everything without crippling our economy, such plans really don’t add up.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/t_XOfhQ2Q8pn0Eihbaza4g--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/710b4188b8e44ebd02c332c03dfb8d66,Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans
Meghan McCain Spars With Cory Booker Over Civility: Beto Was ‘Very Nasty’ to Me!,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:39:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/meghan-mccain-spars-cory-booker-163901660.html,"During a Wednesday interview with Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, The View’s Meghan McCain did what she apparently does best: Make the conversation about herself and, in this case, her personal beef with a presidential hopeful.After applauding Booker for saying Medicare for All is unrealistic, the conservative View co-host took issue with the New Jersey senator’s support for mandatory gun buybacks. This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he’s going to take her brother’s guns.After a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they’d continue the conversation in the next segment.“No we’re not,” McCain grumbled. “It’s fine.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

She said the project would feature a museum, library, gym, and forum.“Barack and I wouldn’t bring some crap up in our neighborhood,” she reportedly said. She pointed out that she hails from the area by birth and that her husband Barack comes from South Side by choice.During his speech at the forum, Barack Obama said: “We joke about it a little bit, like this is the mothership.”While they hope the center could anchor a potential economic revival in the area, there have been setbacks.Opponents of the project are pursuing a federal court appeal after losing a lawsuit.

A staffer sitting behind her was captured on video as her eyes widened in shock.""You have demonstrated that you will pursue this heinous white supremacist ideology at all costs,"" said Wasserman Schultz. Cuccinelli answered that neither he nor the President was a white supremacist.""That's false,"" Cuccinelli said, calling Wasserman Schultz's statements ""defamatory.""Cuccinelli had been summoned to the hearing to discuss the Trump administration's decision to temporarily stop granting deportation deferments for illegal aliens receiving life-saving treatment in the U.S.Representative Ayanna Pressley (D., Ohio) also entered into a heated exchange with Cuccinelli over who was responsible for the decision, himself or White House officials.

"Former &lt;/&gt;Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:11:25 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/former-time-editor-wants-hate-211125098.html,"A former Time editor claimed that the United States needs a law banning hate speech, and that President Donald Trump “might be in violation of it” if there were one -- because, apparently, he doesn’t notice the irony of holding both of these views at once.In a Tuesday tweet promoting his Washington Post piece, titled “Why America needs a hate speech law,” Richard Stengel stated:> My @WashingtonPost piece on why the very broadness of the First Amendment suggests we should have a hate speech law. And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f> > -- Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019In the piece, Stengel writes that “many nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred” in the wake of World War II:> These laws started out as protections against the kinds of anti-Semitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws, but there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general, hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.“I’m all for protecting ‘thought that we hate,’ but not speech that incites hate,” he continues. “It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.”It’s interesting how Stengel actually does acknowledge the fact that “there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is,” and yet he still wants laws banning it. This makes absolutely no sense. After all, when he calls for laws to ban “hate speech,” he is, inherently, giving the government the power to decide what would and would not qualify -- the exact same government that is led by Donald Trump, and that is full of people who support him.In other words: Stengel somehow trusts that the government will have the same view of “hate speech” as he does, and then, in the same thought, seems to acknowledge that there’s actually no way that many of them would. Unless he thinks that the president and his congressional supporters would actually pass a law that they’d be in violation of, his argument for “hate speech” laws winds up being a pretty great argument against them.It’s ironic, but it’s not new: More often than not, it’s the uber-progressives arguing for laws against “hate speech” -- despite the fact that they’re often the same people who are also arguing that Donald Trump and Republicans are constantly spewing it. Maybe it’s just me, but if I thought that the leader of my government was, you know, literally Hitler or whatever, the last thing that I’d want would be to give that person and their supporters control over my speech.Yes, the First Amendment gives us the right to be “offensive” with our speech. Given the fact that a new thing seems to be declared “racist” or “sexist” every day, I’m certainly glad that we do have this protection. After all, it would only take there being a few too many of the “super woke” in our government for a phrase like “you guys” to become a criminal offense.The truth is, though, the right to be “offensive” (however you define that subjective term, anyway) is not even the most important role that our First Amendment plays. No, what’s most important is that it protects our right to speak out against the government when we see fit -- without having to worry about its retaliation. Like it or not, the only way to ensure that we retain this important check on government power is to never (ever) give its leaders a vehicle take it away.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eTNessteMBpuBTcqmJGuYw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/bae9af12e23cce197b317b5c1be56053,"Former </>Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony"

Circuit for the U.S. Court of Appeals on Tuesday night halted the scheduled release of grand-jury materials from Robert Mueller’s investigation, just hours ahead of the scheduled distribution.The decision came after a federal judge ruled last Friday that the Justice Department must release unredacted material from the original Mueller investigation, a move House Democrats have clamored for in the midst of the ongoing impeachment inquiry.Judge Beryl Howell, an Obama appointee, wrote that the committee “has shown that it needs the grand jury material referenced and cited in the Mueller Report to avoid a possible injustice in the impeachment inquiry.”The DOJ contested Howell’s ruling and issued an emergency appeal, saying a quick release “threatens an irreparable loss of grand-jury secrecy before this court even has a chance to act on the Department’s stay motion.” The government also noted that Howell gave no explanation for her seemingly arbitrary deadline of Wednesday, which was not offered by Democrats.The three-judge D.C. panel — made up of judges appointed by Barack Obama — decided on an administrative stay in order “to give the court sufficient opportunity to consider the emergency motion for stay pending appeal and should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits of that motion,” according to the decision.The debate centers around the validity of redactions to a grand-jury deposition, which is usually kept secret. The DOJ argues that materials in the report are squarely protected by federal evidence regulations, while others point to ongoing criminal matters involved, including a probe by Connecticut U.S attorney John Durham the origins of the investigation.

The report also follows a string of high-profile attacks against homeless people in the area, including the killing of Darrell Fields, a beloved musician who was burned to death in his tent on Skid Row.“We’ve got three people a day dying on the streets,” said Adam Rice, an organizer with Los Angeles Community Action Network (LA Can), a group that had worked closely with Fields. “It is a complete failure of leadership. Darrell didn’t need to die. None of these people needed to die. The reason this is happening is because there’s not proper housing.”Darrell Fields, 62, was a homeless man in Los Angeles known as Mr Guitar. He was killed in August when his tent was set ablaze. Photograph: Los Angeles Community Action NetworkSoaring rents and a major shortage of affordable housing have pushed people out of their homes in the area, with more than half of unsheltered adults in a recent count saying they were experiencing homelessness for the first time. The county estimated that there are now 8,800 homeless families.“It brings an overwhelming sadness when you think about precious human beings dying in our streets when it can be avoided,” said the Rev Andy Bales, CEO of Union Rescue Mission (URM), which runs a shelter at Skid Row, at the epicenter of the crisis in downtown LA.The county’s analysis also found that the mortality rate among homeless people has also jumped: “Put simply, being homeless in LA county is becoming increasingly deadly,” the agency wrote.The increase in overdoses represented the largest jump in terms of causes of death, the report found. In addition, the mortality rate among white homeless people has decreased while the rate of deaths for black and Latino residents has increased, the county said. Overall, African Americans are four times more likely to experience homelessness in LA county than other groups.Of the transportation-related deaths, which include vehicle and train collisions, 82% of victims were pedestrians and cyclists.The county and local clinics have increasingly sent healthcare workers to encampments to try to serve people on the streets. More than 21,000 homeless people were also placed in housing last year, an increase from 2017, officials reported early this year.The health department report this week recommended more direct outreach to homeless people, the creation of a “death review team” to study the subject and more traffic safety measures near encampments.Bales predicted that medical visits were not enough to reverse the deadly trends: “What we need most is for everyone to be immediately under a roof and protected from the elements. Until that happens, the death rates will continue to grow … and more and more people will be devastated by homelessness.”The crisis demanded a more urgent response, he added: “How much evidence do we need to gather before we decide not to let another human being die on the street?”LA’s homeless crisis has recently received national attention, with the Trump administration suggesting it could pursue some kind of law enforcement crackdown, drawing skepticism from some local organizations. Advocates have criticized efforts to further criminalize people living on the streets and have argued that the government needs to put more funding to housing and shelter.“It’s really a travesty when you think about it. How many deaths could’ve been prevented?” said Kourtney Milligan, a 29-year-old homeless woman, who has lived on Skid Row. “The resources that they say are out there are so hard to find.”",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/s2XrfBGfKBrVbz9mGlm7bg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/f15aa3ae803200f5d01035f9967bdb02,"More than 1,000 homeless people died in Los Angeles county last year"

Denmark Snubs Trump With Approval of Russian Gas Pipe to Europe,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 14:14:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/denmark-snubs-trump-approval-russian-141104626.html,"(Bloomberg) -- In a major boost for Russia’s effort to tighten its grip over natural gas supplies to western Europe, Denmark said it will allow the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline to pass through its territory.The decision removes the last important hurdle for the $11 billion project, which is slated for commissioning by the end of this year and bolster gas flows from Siberia into Germany. The link has drawn the threat of sanctions from the U.S., which wants Europe to buy its liquefied natural gas. It risks reigniting a feud between Donald Trump and Danish lawmakers that erupted in the summer after the U.S. president’s offer to buy Greenland.Russian President Vladimir Putin welcomed the pipeline decision. “Denmark showed itself to be a responsible participant in international relations, defending its interests and sovereignty and the interests of its main partners in Europe,” he told a briefing in Budapest, where he was on a visit.The green light gives Gazprom PJSC, Russia’s gas export champion and already Europe’s biggest supplier, yet another route to one of the world’s most liquid gas markets. While Trump has accused Russia of using its natural gas as a political weapon, it’s ultimately a commercial deal over which Washington has little influence, according to Raffaello Pantucci, Director of Security Studies at the Royal United Services Institute in London.“It’s frankly too far advanced,” Pantucci said. “Who are they going to sanction?”The approval also gives Russia more clout in ongoing talks with Ukraine on a new gas transit deal, increasing the risk of a disruption from Jan. 1. Uncertainty about whether those two nations can agree on time has been weighing on forward prices in Europe and sending incentives for traders to stockpile gas as a cushion against disruption.“If Gazprom are confident in Nord Stream 2’s imminent completion, it may encourage a tougher negotiating stance on any new Ukrainian transit deal,” said John Twomey, a gas analyst at BloombergNEF in London. “If anything, the risks of a disruption on Jan. 1 have gone up as a result of this.”The pipeline has divided EU governments, with nations led by Poland concerned about the bloc’s increasing dependence on Russian gas.“It is not too late to stop NS2,” an official at the U.S. embassy in Germany said. “There are clear negative energy security and geopolitical implications for Europe from Putin’s pipeline. The U.S. government agrees with the European Parliament, the U.S. House and nearly 20 European countries in our opposition to NS2.”Russia, Ukraine, Europe Pledge New Gas Deal by Year-EndDenmark said on Wednesday it will allow the pipeline to pass southeast of the island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea. The company behind the pipeline submitted the route plan in April. Denmark had been conducting a security and environmental review of the project.Trump had objected to the link, instead urging the European Union to diversify the sources of its energy and dilute Putin’s economic influence over the region. U.S. officials have also warned that project partners are at an elevated risk of U.S. sanctions.The approval is another snub of Trump by the Nordic country after it ruled out his proposal to buy Greenland this summer. The president responded by canceling a state visit to Denmark.The Danish approval covers 147 kilometers (91 miles) of the project. Nord Stream 2 said in its statement that it has already completed 87%, or 2,100 kilometers, of the pipeline in Russian, Finnish and Swedish waters as well as most of the German part. Dan Jorgensen, Denmark’s minister for climate, energy and utilities, declined to comment on Wednesday.Nord Stream 2 said it will continue its “constructive cooperation with the Danish authorities to complete the pipeline.”Six WeeksGazprom CEO Alexey Miller said that the pipeline is expected to be completed on time by the end of the year. “The remaining 147 kilometers -- that’s five weeks of work,” Miller told reporters in Budapest.A statement from the company highlighted some uncertainties in that timetable. Nord Stream 2 said Wednesday the actual start of the construction depends on a number of legal, technical and environmental factors, which will “take a few weeks” and the project aims for completion “in the coming months.”Gazprom can’t use the permit for the next four weeks when all involved parties have leeway to make a complaint under Danish law. Those issues left analysts anticipating some delay beyond Jan. 1 for the completion of the link.“It’s unlikely that Nord Stream 2 is online in time for Jan. 1, so Ukrainian transit disruption risks remains,” said Twomey.While Gazprom owns the pipeline, half the financing of the 8 billion-euro capital cost comes from five European companies: Uniper SE and Wintershall of Germany, OMV AG of Austria, Engie SA of France and Royal Dutch Shell Plc.Dutch gas for the first quarter declined to the lowest since at least 2017 as the region is oversupplied with the fuel, storage sites across Europe are full, and LNG imports surge.(Updates with Putin comment in third paragraph.)\--With assistance from Dina Khrennikova, Vanessa Dezem and Ilya Arkhipov.To contact the reporters on this story: Morten Buttler in Copenhagen at mbuttler@bloomberg.net;William Wilkes in Frankfurt at wwilkes1@bloomberg.net;Anna Shiryaevskaya in London at ashiryaevska@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Christian Wienberg at cwienberg@bloomberg.net, ;Tasneem Hanfi Brögger at tbrogger@bloomberg.net, ;Nick Rigillo at nrigillo@bloomberg.net, Gregory L.

Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 10:05:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-warren-untenable-plans-140521979.html,"If you’ve been having trouble finding someone to walk your dog, don’t worry. Any day now, Elizabeth Warren will announce “a plan for that.” It will undoubtedly be comprehensive, detailed, and replete with subsidies for lower- and middle-class dog walkers and underserved breeds. It will cost tens of billions of dollars and will receive widespread positive notice from the media. However, to judge by her other recent plans, the one thing it won’t include is any discussion of how she plans to pay for it.The Massachusetts senator has challenged and possibly overtaken former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, largely based on having a plan for the government to tackle every problem facing this country, no matter how big or how small, from issues with military housing to Puerto Rican debt to climate change.The price tag for this massive expansion of government is enormous. Much of the attention in recent weeks has been focused on Warren’s embrace of Medicare for All, which she refuses to admit would require an increase in middle-class taxes. Even Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has conceded that such proposals, which would cost $30–40 trillion over 10 years, cannot be financed without tax hikes. Warren’s refusal to address this obvious fact makes her look less like a would-be policy wonk and more like a typical politician.But even setting aside Medicare for All, Warren’s plans are likely to dump oceans of red ink onto our growing national debt. Her non-health-care spending proposals already total some $7.5 trillion per year over the next 10 years. Although these are not quite Bernie levels of government largesse, her proposals would still require nearly double our current levels of spending.To pay for all this, Warren proposes a variety of tax hikes, mostly designed to hit corporations or high-earners: higher payroll taxes for those earning more than $250,000 per year; a 7 percent profits tax on companies earning more than $100 million; a 60 percent lobbying tax on firms that spend a million or more on lobbying, and so forth. But the biggest chunk of money would come from Warren’s proposed “wealth tax,” a 2 to 3 percent levy on net worth above $50 million. Warren estimates that this wealth tax will pull in more than $2.75 trillion over ten years. It won’t.First, there is the slight problem that a wealth tax is probably unconstitutional. Of course, constitutional constraints are quaint notions in the Age of Trump. Regardless, it is worth noting that the Constitution permits the federal government to impose only “direct taxes,” such as a property tax. That’s why it required a constitutional amendment to enact the federal income tax. Many constitutional scholars warn that a wealth tax is neither a direct tax nor income tax.Even if Warren can find a way around the constitutional guardrails -- perhaps by something such as a retrospective wealth tax in which you wait until a taxpayer sells assets or passes away -- a wealth tax is unlikely to raise anywhere near the amount of money she predicts.Simply look at Europe’s experiments with wealth taxes. At one time, a dozen European countries imposed wealth taxes. Today, all but three have abandoned those levies. Among those repealing their wealth tax are the Scandinavian social democracies that Warren admires, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Norway retains a wealth tax but has significantly reduced it in recent years. Additional countries abandoning the tax include Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Other countries, such as Great Britain, have considered wealth taxes and rejected them.They did so because wealth taxes are administratively complex and difficult to enforce. Also, they significantly reduce investment, entrepreneurship, and, ultimately, economic growth. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, European wealth taxes raised, on average, only about 0.2 percent of GDP in revenues. By comparison, the U.S. federal income tax raises 8 percent of GDP.Two groups, however, would benefit substantially from a wealth tax. The tax would be a full-employment opportunity for the tax-preparation industry and for lawyers. After all, we would now have to determine fair market value for everything from homes and vehicles to artwork and jewelry to family pension rights and intellectual property. The other big winner would be lobbyists, who could be expected to descend on Washington en masse seeking exemptions and exceptions for their clients. If you think the tax code is a mess today, just wait until D.C. is done with Warren’s plan.There is an old Yiddish proverb that goes “Mann tracht, un Gott Lacht,” or “Man plans, and God laughs.” It is all well and good that Senator Warren has a plan for everything. But until she actually figures out how to pay for everything without crippling our economy, such plans really don’t add up.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/t_XOfhQ2Q8pn0Eihbaza4g--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/710b4188b8e44ebd02c332c03dfb8d66,Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans
Meghan McCain Spars With Cory Booker Over Civility: Beto Was ‘Very Nasty’ to Me!,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:39:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/meghan-mccain-spars-cory-booker-163901660.html,"During a Wednesday interview with Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, The View’s Meghan McCain did what she apparently does best: Make the conversation about herself and, in this case, her personal beef with a presidential hopeful.After applauding Booker for saying Medicare for All is unrealistic, the conservative View co-host took issue with the New Jersey senator’s support for mandatory gun buybacks. This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he’s going to take her brother’s guns.After a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they’d continue the conversation in the next segment.“No we’re not,” McCain grumbled. “It’s fine.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Tucker Carlson and Guest Blame Diversity and ‘Woke’ Culture for California Fires,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 07:17:19 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/tucker-carlson-guest-blame-diversity-032855316.html,"Fox NewsFox News host Tucker Carlson and his guest, conservative YouTube personality Dave Rubin, both insisted Tuesday night that the wildfires burning across California are due largely to progressive ideology, “woke” culture, and diversity in hiring.During Tuesday’s broadcast of Tucker Carlson Tonight, Carlson welcomed on Rubin, a political commentator and podcaster, to discuss the issues surrounding the large fires engulfing the state, including those related to the electrical grid and firefighting methods.“PG&E; strikes me as almost a metaphor for the destruction of the state,” Carlson said about the state’s power company. “Here’s the utility which doesn’t really know anything about its own infrastructure but knows everything about the race of its employees. How did we get there?”After noting that he lives near one of the fires in the Los Angeles area, Rubin immediately took aim at liberal politics as the main reason the wildfires have grown so large and dangerous.“The problem right now is that everything, EVERYTHING, from academia to public utilities to politics, everything that goes woke, that buys into this ridiculous progressive ideology that cares about what contractors are LGBT or how many black firemen we have or white this or Asian that, everything that goes that road eventually breaks down,” he declared.As Carlson nodded and said “that’s true,” Rubin continued, complaining that this isn’t how “freedom is supposed to operate.”“What is supposed to happen—imagine if your house was on fire,” he added. “Would you care what the public utility or what the fire company, what contractor they brought in, what gender or sexuality or any of those things he or she was? It’s just absolutely ridiculous.”The Fox News host continued to agree with Rubin, who went on to tie PG&E;’s preemptive blackouts to a lack of “libertarian or conservative-minded people in California to fight what the progressives are doing to the state.”“If you can’t keep the lights on and you can’t keep the place from burning down, you’ve reached the point where there is no kind of lying about it anymore,” Carlson concluded. “It’s falling apart.

A staffer sitting behind her was captured on video as her eyes widened in shock.""You have demonstrated that you will pursue this heinous white supremacist ideology at all costs,"" said Wasserman Schultz. Cuccinelli answered that neither he nor the President was a white supremacist.""That's false,"" Cuccinelli said, calling Wasserman Schultz's statements ""defamatory.""Cuccinelli had been summoned to the hearing to discuss the Trump administration's decision to temporarily stop granting deportation deferments for illegal aliens receiving life-saving treatment in the U.S.Representative Ayanna Pressley (D., Ohio) also entered into a heated exchange with Cuccinelli over who was responsible for the decision, himself or White House officials. Cuccinelli repeatedly asserted that he made the decision and that no White House official was involved.Trump had considered appointing Cuccinelli secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. However, Senator Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) said the idea was a non-starter.“It’s my understanding that the existing law would not permit him to” lead the organization, Grassley said. “I don’t know how you get around that.” Grassley was referring to current laws that govern succession rules within the federal government.On Tuesday, a top Border Patrol official warned that illegal immigration could hit crisis levels if courts keep blocking Trump's immigration policies.""We will go back, mark the words, we will go back to the crisis level that we had before,"" said chief of law enforcement operations for the Border Patrol Brian Hastings.

"Former &lt;/&gt;Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:11:25 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/former-time-editor-wants-hate-211125098.html,"A former Time editor claimed that the United States needs a law banning hate speech, and that President Donald Trump “might be in violation of it” if there were one -- because, apparently, he doesn’t notice the irony of holding both of these views at once.In a Tuesday tweet promoting his Washington Post piece, titled “Why America needs a hate speech law,” Richard Stengel stated:> My @WashingtonPost piece on why the very broadness of the First Amendment suggests we should have a hate speech law. And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f> > -- Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019In the piece, Stengel writes that “many nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred” in the wake of World War II:> These laws started out as protections against the kinds of anti-Semitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws, but there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general, hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.“I’m all for protecting ‘thought that we hate,’ but not speech that incites hate,” he continues. “It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.”It’s interesting how Stengel actually does acknowledge the fact that “there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is,” and yet he still wants laws banning it. This makes absolutely no sense. After all, when he calls for laws to ban “hate speech,” he is, inherently, giving the government the power to decide what would and would not qualify -- the exact same government that is led by Donald Trump, and that is full of people who support him.In other words: Stengel somehow trusts that the government will have the same view of “hate speech” as he does, and then, in the same thought, seems to acknowledge that there’s actually no way that many of them would. Unless he thinks that the president and his congressional supporters would actually pass a law that they’d be in violation of, his argument for “hate speech” laws winds up being a pretty great argument against them.It’s ironic, but it’s not new: More often than not, it’s the uber-progressives arguing for laws against “hate speech” -- despite the fact that they’re often the same people who are also arguing that Donald Trump and Republicans are constantly spewing it. Maybe it’s just me, but if I thought that the leader of my government was, you know, literally Hitler or whatever, the last thing that I’d want would be to give that person and their supporters control over my speech.Yes, the First Amendment gives us the right to be “offensive” with our speech. Given the fact that a new thing seems to be declared “racist” or “sexist” every day, I’m certainly glad that we do have this protection. After all, it would only take there being a few too many of the “super woke” in our government for a phrase like “you guys” to become a criminal offense.The truth is, though, the right to be “offensive” (however you define that subjective term, anyway) is not even the most important role that our First Amendment plays. No, what’s most important is that it protects our right to speak out against the government when we see fit -- without having to worry about its retaliation. Like it or not, the only way to ensure that we retain this important check on government power is to never (ever) give its leaders a vehicle take it away.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eTNessteMBpuBTcqmJGuYw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/bae9af12e23cce197b317b5c1be56053,"Former </>Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony"

"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:17:36 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/record-wave-lone-child-migrants-122133758.html,"TENOSIQUE, Mexico -- The United States has detained more children trying to cross the nation's southwest border on their own over the last year than during any other period on record, surpassing the surge of unaccompanied minors that set off a crisis during the Obama administration, according to new figures released Tuesday.U.S. immigration authorities apprehended 76,020 minors, most of them from Central America, traveling without their parents in the fiscal year that ended in September -- 52% more than during the last fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Mexico is experiencing the same surge. Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period -- pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.In interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous -- and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.""These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,"" Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters. ""And each month during the fiscal year, the numbers increased. You saw them. We all saw them.""The young migrants came alongside a historic wave of families traveling together, also largely from Central America. They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.Marvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced -- and he pressed on.""Quitting was not an option,"" Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. ""You wipe your tears and carry on.""For the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they'd kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.His parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said. ""We can't bear losing another son,"" they told him. ""You have to go.""He left home in the spring, with $40 in his pocket and no plan except to find work in a safer place.As for most underage migrants traveling without their parents, his trip north has been a feat of improvisation and courage. He walked and hitchhiked through Honduras and Guatemala. He slept in churches, under trees or wherever he found himself when night fell.Along the way, he gathered crucial bits of information from fellow migrants: the best route to take, locations of shelters up ahead, places to avoid, where to forage for food.As huge numbers of young migrants from Central America began arriving at the United States' southern border in 2014, the Obama administration scrambled to house them until they could be released to sponsors -- adults who applied to care for them. The shelter system grew dramatically as a result.The Trump administration experienced similar backups at the border just a few years later -- this time because of new, more stringent policies that made the sponsors themselves, who are often undocumented, vulnerable to immigration authorities. This discouraged people from coming forward, leaving thousands of children to languish in the system.The Trump administration has also sought to deter migration by separating thousands of children from their relatives, again driving up the number of children in federally contracted shelters.On the road, while trying to avoid detention, fear and hunger are constant companions for many young migrants.With little or no money in their pockets, they relied on strangers for snacks or meals. They pawed through garbage and scanned drifts of debris on the roadside, hoping to spot an edible morsel.Wilson, a 17-year-old Honduran, said he had feasted on rotten mangos discarded by street vendors.""I used to drink water from potholes when I was too thirsty,"" interjected Mario Leonel, 16, who left home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, several weeks ago without notifying his parents. ""That is the hardest part of it all: the hunger.""When he arrived at the shelter in Tenosique, a small Mexican town near the Guatemala border, he called his parents in Honduras, who burst into tears and pleaded for him to return. He said no. He was tired of all the violence in his country, and wanted to get asylum in the United States.After Marvel slipped across the Guatemala-Mexico border in May, he found room at a shelter in Tenosique, which serves as a transit point for many migrants. He quickly made new friends among other teenage migrants who had made it this far, mainly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador.On a recent afternoon, several of them gathered in a two-story building that had been reserved for minors, its walls painted with colorful animal murals. The boys cracked jokes, roughhoused and argued about who was the cutest girl in the shelter.Outside, Dulce, a 16-year-old transgender migrant from Guatemala, sat alone on train tracks pining for a boy she had met at the shelter. He had left without explanation and she was lovesick.""I just can't get him out of my mind,"" she said.She left her hometown four months earlier to escape abuse from her family and strangers, including a sexual assault by gang members when she was 12. She made it as far as central Mexico before being detained and deported. Five days after returning home, she set off again.""I left because I had nothing there and no one to protect me,"" she said. ""At least here I am safe.""Though the United States remains the destination of choice for most unaccompanied minors, an increasing number are setting their sights no farther than Mexico, advocates and migrants say.Sometimes they have no choice: Mexico's increased enforcement measures have made it more difficult for migrants to make it to the border with the United States. And even if they reach the United States, recent policies have drastically lowered the possibilities of getting asylum.In Mexico, when unaccompanied minors are detained, the law mandates that they be released right away into the custody of the national child protection agency, which finds them accommodation in shelters designed for children.But migrants' advocates say the government has been holding children in the nation's overcrowded detention centers for far too long, and that some children are quickly funneled into the deportation process rather than being given a fair chance to seek asylum or some other form of relief.""No child should ever be held at a detention center,"" said Elba Coria, a migration expert from the Clinic for Refugees at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City. ""But while international standards consider children's detention as an exceptional measure, amid Mexico's migration chaos, it is the rule.""Neither Marvel nor any of his new friends in the Tenosique shelter had been detained by the authorities. All had managed to cross into Mexico from Guatemala and had applied for asylum in Mexico after talking through their options with the shelter staff.They now plan to remain in Mexico and look for work and study opportunities -- even if they haven't abandoned hope of making it to the United States.""It is every Honduran's boy dream to get to the United States, where there is more money and kids are able to go to school,"" said Jose Angel, 17. He was born with a disability that left him unable to use his arms and left his hometown because his grandmother could no longer take care of him.He was hopeful he could apply for asylum in the United States despite Trump's many efforts to severely lower the number of people granted asylum. ""It is scary, but you have to take a chance,"" he said.On a recent morning, Alan, a 17-year-old Guatemalan migrant, sat on the sidewalk outside a migrant shelter in the city of Palenque, in southern Mexico. He had just crossed the border and was exhausted. Mexican immigration officials had stopped a bus he was on, but he managed to escape into the countryside and hide.Alan planned to take a nap, shower and have a meal before trying illegally to board a freight train known as The Beast. It runs from Mexico's border with Guatemala to its border with the United States and, for decades, migrants have clung to it to speed through much of Mexico.His hope was to make it to the U.S. border and petition for asylum. He was undeterred by Trump's recent efforts to restrict asylum claims or curb immigration.""One way or another, I have to make it to the other side where there are skyscrapers and life is better,"" he said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5ol82jExNHqBHa7IGzz2mw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/03f35d3f9d537a8dc9fe503d06c098de,"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation"

Circuit for the U.S. Court of Appeals on Tuesday night halted the scheduled release of grand-jury materials from Robert Mueller’s investigation, just hours ahead of the scheduled distribution.The decision came after a federal judge ruled last Friday that the Justice Department must release unredacted material from the original Mueller investigation, a move House Democrats have clamored for in the midst of the ongoing impeachment inquiry.Judge Beryl Howell, an Obama appointee, wrote that the committee “has shown that it needs the grand jury material referenced and cited in the Mueller Report to avoid a possible injustice in the impeachment inquiry.”The DOJ contested Howell’s ruling and issued an emergency appeal, saying a quick release “threatens an irreparable loss of grand-jury secrecy before this court even has a chance to act on the Department’s stay motion.” The government also noted that Howell gave no explanation for her seemingly arbitrary deadline of Wednesday, which was not offered by Democrats.The three-judge D.C. panel — made up of judges appointed by Barack Obama — decided on an administrative stay in order “to give the court sufficient opportunity to consider the emergency motion for stay pending appeal and should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits of that motion,” according to the decision.The debate centers around the validity of redactions to a grand-jury deposition, which is usually kept secret. The DOJ argues that materials in the report are squarely protected by federal evidence regulations, while others point to ongoing criminal matters involved, including a probe by Connecticut U.S attorney John Durham the origins of the investigation.

Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 10:05:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-warren-untenable-plans-140521979.html,"If you’ve been having trouble finding someone to walk your dog, don’t worry. Any day now, Elizabeth Warren will announce “a plan for that.” It will undoubtedly be comprehensive, detailed, and replete with subsidies for lower- and middle-class dog walkers and underserved breeds. It will cost tens of billions of dollars and will receive widespread positive notice from the media. However, to judge by her other recent plans, the one thing it won’t include is any discussion of how she plans to pay for it.The Massachusetts senator has challenged and possibly overtaken former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, largely based on having a plan for the government to tackle every problem facing this country, no matter how big or how small, from issues with military housing to Puerto Rican debt to climate change.The price tag for this massive expansion of government is enormous. Much of the attention in recent weeks has been focused on Warren’s embrace of Medicare for All, which she refuses to admit would require an increase in middle-class taxes. Even Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has conceded that such proposals, which would cost $30–40 trillion over 10 years, cannot be financed without tax hikes. Warren’s refusal to address this obvious fact makes her look less like a would-be policy wonk and more like a typical politician.But even setting aside Medicare for All, Warren’s plans are likely to dump oceans of red ink onto our growing national debt. Her non-health-care spending proposals already total some $7.5 trillion per year over the next 10 years. Although these are not quite Bernie levels of government largesse, her proposals would still require nearly double our current levels of spending.To pay for all this, Warren proposes a variety of tax hikes, mostly designed to hit corporations or high-earners: higher payroll taxes for those earning more than $250,000 per year; a 7 percent profits tax on companies earning more than $100 million; a 60 percent lobbying tax on firms that spend a million or more on lobbying, and so forth. But the biggest chunk of money would come from Warren’s proposed “wealth tax,” a 2 to 3 percent levy on net worth above $50 million. Warren estimates that this wealth tax will pull in more than $2.75 trillion over ten years. It won’t.First, there is the slight problem that a wealth tax is probably unconstitutional. Of course, constitutional constraints are quaint notions in the Age of Trump. Regardless, it is worth noting that the Constitution permits the federal government to impose only “direct taxes,” such as a property tax. That’s why it required a constitutional amendment to enact the federal income tax. Many constitutional scholars warn that a wealth tax is neither a direct tax nor income tax.Even if Warren can find a way around the constitutional guardrails -- perhaps by something such as a retrospective wealth tax in which you wait until a taxpayer sells assets or passes away -- a wealth tax is unlikely to raise anywhere near the amount of money she predicts.Simply look at Europe’s experiments with wealth taxes. At one time, a dozen European countries imposed wealth taxes. Today, all but three have abandoned those levies. Among those repealing their wealth tax are the Scandinavian social democracies that Warren admires, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Norway retains a wealth tax but has significantly reduced it in recent years. Additional countries abandoning the tax include Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Other countries, such as Great Britain, have considered wealth taxes and rejected them.They did so because wealth taxes are administratively complex and difficult to enforce. Also, they significantly reduce investment, entrepreneurship, and, ultimately, economic growth. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, European wealth taxes raised, on average, only about 0.2 percent of GDP in revenues. By comparison, the U.S. federal income tax raises 8 percent of GDP.Two groups, however, would benefit substantially from a wealth tax. The tax would be a full-employment opportunity for the tax-preparation industry and for lawyers. After all, we would now have to determine fair market value for everything from homes and vehicles to artwork and jewelry to family pension rights and intellectual property. The other big winner would be lobbyists, who could be expected to descend on Washington en masse seeking exemptions and exceptions for their clients. If you think the tax code is a mess today, just wait until D.C. is done with Warren’s plan.There is an old Yiddish proverb that goes “Mann tracht, un Gott Lacht,” or “Man plans, and God laughs.” It is all well and good that Senator Warren has a plan for everything. But until she actually figures out how to pay for everything without crippling our economy, such plans really don’t add up.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/t_XOfhQ2Q8pn0Eihbaza4g--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/710b4188b8e44ebd02c332c03dfb8d66,Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans
Meghan McCain Spars With Cory Booker Over Civility: Beto Was ‘Very Nasty’ to Me!,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:39:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/meghan-mccain-spars-cory-booker-163901660.html,"During a Wednesday interview with Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, The View’s Meghan McCain did what she apparently does best: Make the conversation about herself and, in this case, her personal beef with a presidential hopeful.After applauding Booker for saying Medicare for All is unrealistic, the conservative View co-host took issue with the New Jersey senator’s support for mandatory gun buybacks. This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he’s going to take her brother’s guns.After a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they’d continue the conversation in the next segment.“No we’re not,” McCain grumbled. “It’s fine.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

How did we get there?”After noting that he lives near one of the fires in the Los Angeles area, Rubin immediately took aim at liberal politics as the main reason the wildfires have grown so large and dangerous.“The problem right now is that everything, EVERYTHING, from academia to public utilities to politics, everything that goes woke, that buys into this ridiculous progressive ideology that cares about what contractors are LGBT or how many black firemen we have or white this or Asian that, everything that goes that road eventually breaks down,” he declared.As Carlson nodded and said “that’s true,” Rubin continued, complaining that this isn’t how “freedom is supposed to operate.”“What is supposed to happen—imagine if your house was on fire,” he added. “Would you care what the public utility or what the fire company, what contractor they brought in, what gender or sexuality or any of those things he or she was? It’s just absolutely ridiculous.”The Fox News host continued to agree with Rubin, who went on to tie PG&E;’s preemptive blackouts to a lack of “libertarian or conservative-minded people in California to fight what the progressives are doing to the state.”“If you can’t keep the lights on and you can’t keep the place from burning down, you’ve reached the point where there is no kind of lying about it anymore,” Carlson concluded. “It’s falling apart.

"Former &lt;/&gt;Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:11:25 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/former-time-editor-wants-hate-211125098.html,"A former Time editor claimed that the United States needs a law banning hate speech, and that President Donald Trump “might be in violation of it” if there were one -- because, apparently, he doesn’t notice the irony of holding both of these views at once.In a Tuesday tweet promoting his Washington Post piece, titled “Why America needs a hate speech law,” Richard Stengel stated:> My @WashingtonPost piece on why the very broadness of the First Amendment suggests we should have a hate speech law. And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f> > -- Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019In the piece, Stengel writes that “many nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred” in the wake of World War II:> These laws started out as protections against the kinds of anti-Semitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws, but there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general, hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.“I’m all for protecting ‘thought that we hate,’ but not speech that incites hate,” he continues. “It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.”It’s interesting how Stengel actually does acknowledge the fact that “there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is,” and yet he still wants laws banning it. This makes absolutely no sense. After all, when he calls for laws to ban “hate speech,” he is, inherently, giving the government the power to decide what would and would not qualify -- the exact same government that is led by Donald Trump, and that is full of people who support him.In other words: Stengel somehow trusts that the government will have the same view of “hate speech” as he does, and then, in the same thought, seems to acknowledge that there’s actually no way that many of them would. Unless he thinks that the president and his congressional supporters would actually pass a law that they’d be in violation of, his argument for “hate speech” laws winds up being a pretty great argument against them.It’s ironic, but it’s not new: More often than not, it’s the uber-progressives arguing for laws against “hate speech” -- despite the fact that they’re often the same people who are also arguing that Donald Trump and Republicans are constantly spewing it. Maybe it’s just me, but if I thought that the leader of my government was, you know, literally Hitler or whatever, the last thing that I’d want would be to give that person and their supporters control over my speech.Yes, the First Amendment gives us the right to be “offensive” with our speech. Given the fact that a new thing seems to be declared “racist” or “sexist” every day, I’m certainly glad that we do have this protection. After all, it would only take there being a few too many of the “super woke” in our government for a phrase like “you guys” to become a criminal offense.The truth is, though, the right to be “offensive” (however you define that subjective term, anyway) is not even the most important role that our First Amendment plays. No, what’s most important is that it protects our right to speak out against the government when we see fit -- without having to worry about its retaliation. Like it or not, the only way to ensure that we retain this important check on government power is to never (ever) give its leaders a vehicle take it away.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eTNessteMBpuBTcqmJGuYw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/bae9af12e23cce197b317b5c1be56053,"Former </>Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony"

"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:17:36 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/record-wave-lone-child-migrants-122133758.html,"TENOSIQUE, Mexico -- The United States has detained more children trying to cross the nation's southwest border on their own over the last year than during any other period on record, surpassing the surge of unaccompanied minors that set off a crisis during the Obama administration, according to new figures released Tuesday.U.S. immigration authorities apprehended 76,020 minors, most of them from Central America, traveling without their parents in the fiscal year that ended in September -- 52% more than during the last fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Mexico is experiencing the same surge. Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period -- pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.In interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous -- and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.""These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,"" Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters. ""And each month during the fiscal year, the numbers increased. You saw them. We all saw them.""The young migrants came alongside a historic wave of families traveling together, also largely from Central America. They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.Marvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced -- and he pressed on.""Quitting was not an option,"" Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. ""You wipe your tears and carry on.""For the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they'd kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.His parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said. ""We can't bear losing another son,"" they told him. ""You have to go.""He left home in the spring, with $40 in his pocket and no plan except to find work in a safer place.As for most underage migrants traveling without their parents, his trip north has been a feat of improvisation and courage. He walked and hitchhiked through Honduras and Guatemala. He slept in churches, under trees or wherever he found himself when night fell.Along the way, he gathered crucial bits of information from fellow migrants: the best route to take, locations of shelters up ahead, places to avoid, where to forage for food.As huge numbers of young migrants from Central America began arriving at the United States' southern border in 2014, the Obama administration scrambled to house them until they could be released to sponsors -- adults who applied to care for them. The shelter system grew dramatically as a result.The Trump administration experienced similar backups at the border just a few years later -- this time because of new, more stringent policies that made the sponsors themselves, who are often undocumented, vulnerable to immigration authorities. This discouraged people from coming forward, leaving thousands of children to languish in the system.The Trump administration has also sought to deter migration by separating thousands of children from their relatives, again driving up the number of children in federally contracted shelters.On the road, while trying to avoid detention, fear and hunger are constant companions for many young migrants.With little or no money in their pockets, they relied on strangers for snacks or meals. They pawed through garbage and scanned drifts of debris on the roadside, hoping to spot an edible morsel.Wilson, a 17-year-old Honduran, said he had feasted on rotten mangos discarded by street vendors.""I used to drink water from potholes when I was too thirsty,"" interjected Mario Leonel, 16, who left home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, several weeks ago without notifying his parents. ""That is the hardest part of it all: the hunger.""When he arrived at the shelter in Tenosique, a small Mexican town near the Guatemala border, he called his parents in Honduras, who burst into tears and pleaded for him to return. He said no. He was tired of all the violence in his country, and wanted to get asylum in the United States.After Marvel slipped across the Guatemala-Mexico border in May, he found room at a shelter in Tenosique, which serves as a transit point for many migrants. He quickly made new friends among other teenage migrants who had made it this far, mainly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador.On a recent afternoon, several of them gathered in a two-story building that had been reserved for minors, its walls painted with colorful animal murals. The boys cracked jokes, roughhoused and argued about who was the cutest girl in the shelter.Outside, Dulce, a 16-year-old transgender migrant from Guatemala, sat alone on train tracks pining for a boy she had met at the shelter. He had left without explanation and she was lovesick.""I just can't get him out of my mind,"" she said.She left her hometown four months earlier to escape abuse from her family and strangers, including a sexual assault by gang members when she was 12. She made it as far as central Mexico before being detained and deported. Five days after returning home, she set off again.""I left because I had nothing there and no one to protect me,"" she said. ""At least here I am safe.""Though the United States remains the destination of choice for most unaccompanied minors, an increasing number are setting their sights no farther than Mexico, advocates and migrants say.Sometimes they have no choice: Mexico's increased enforcement measures have made it more difficult for migrants to make it to the border with the United States. And even if they reach the United States, recent policies have drastically lowered the possibilities of getting asylum.In Mexico, when unaccompanied minors are detained, the law mandates that they be released right away into the custody of the national child protection agency, which finds them accommodation in shelters designed for children.But migrants' advocates say the government has been holding children in the nation's overcrowded detention centers for far too long, and that some children are quickly funneled into the deportation process rather than being given a fair chance to seek asylum or some other form of relief.""No child should ever be held at a detention center,"" said Elba Coria, a migration expert from the Clinic for Refugees at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City. ""But while international standards consider children's detention as an exceptional measure, amid Mexico's migration chaos, it is the rule.""Neither Marvel nor any of his new friends in the Tenosique shelter had been detained by the authorities. All had managed to cross into Mexico from Guatemala and had applied for asylum in Mexico after talking through their options with the shelter staff.They now plan to remain in Mexico and look for work and study opportunities -- even if they haven't abandoned hope of making it to the United States.""It is every Honduran's boy dream to get to the United States, where there is more money and kids are able to go to school,"" said Jose Angel, 17. He was born with a disability that left him unable to use his arms and left his hometown because his grandmother could no longer take care of him.He was hopeful he could apply for asylum in the United States despite Trump's many efforts to severely lower the number of people granted asylum. ""It is scary, but you have to take a chance,"" he said.On a recent morning, Alan, a 17-year-old Guatemalan migrant, sat on the sidewalk outside a migrant shelter in the city of Palenque, in southern Mexico. He had just crossed the border and was exhausted. Mexican immigration officials had stopped a bus he was on, but he managed to escape into the countryside and hide.Alan planned to take a nap, shower and have a meal before trying illegally to board a freight train known as The Beast. It runs from Mexico's border with Guatemala to its border with the United States and, for decades, migrants have clung to it to speed through much of Mexico.His hope was to make it to the U.S. border and petition for asylum. He was undeterred by Trump's recent efforts to restrict asylum claims or curb immigration.""One way or another, I have to make it to the other side where there are skyscrapers and life is better,"" he said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5ol82jExNHqBHa7IGzz2mw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/03f35d3f9d537a8dc9fe503d06c098de,"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation"

D.C. Panel Halts Release of Mueller Documents at DOJ’s Request,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 09:02:23 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/d-c-panel-halts-release-130223421.html,"The D.C. Circuit for the U.S. Court of Appeals on Tuesday night halted the scheduled release of grand-jury materials from Robert Mueller’s investigation, just hours ahead of the scheduled distribution.The decision came after a federal judge ruled last Friday that the Justice Department must release unredacted material from the original Mueller investigation, a move House Democrats have clamored for in the midst of the ongoing impeachment inquiry.Judge Beryl Howell, an Obama appointee, wrote that the committee “has shown that it needs the grand jury material referenced and cited in the Mueller Report to avoid a possible injustice in the impeachment inquiry.”The DOJ contested Howell’s ruling and issued an emergency appeal, saying a quick release “threatens an irreparable loss of grand-jury secrecy before this court even has a chance to act on the Department’s stay motion.” The government also noted that Howell gave no explanation for her seemingly arbitrary deadline of Wednesday, which was not offered by Democrats.The three-judge D.C. panel — made up of judges appointed by Barack Obama — decided on an administrative stay in order “to give the court sufficient opportunity to consider the emergency motion for stay pending appeal and should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits of that motion,” according to the decision.The debate centers around the validity of redactions to a grand-jury deposition, which is usually kept secret. The DOJ argues that materials in the report are squarely protected by federal evidence regulations, while others point to ongoing criminal matters involved, including a probe by Connecticut U.S attorney John Durham the origins of the investigation. House Democrats counter that secrecy rules do not apply to the impeachment inquiry, which is a judicial proceeding.",http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/w_heEZnk1hoDQSTVWqjVSg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/5cc14c5df368875c0317fc539bb227fd,D.C.

Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 10:05:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-warren-untenable-plans-140521979.html,"If you’ve been having trouble finding someone to walk your dog, don’t worry. Any day now, Elizabeth Warren will announce “a plan for that.” It will undoubtedly be comprehensive, detailed, and replete with subsidies for lower- and middle-class dog walkers and underserved breeds. It will cost tens of billions of dollars and will receive widespread positive notice from the media. However, to judge by her other recent plans, the one thing it won’t include is any discussion of how she plans to pay for it.The Massachusetts senator has challenged and possibly overtaken former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, largely based on having a plan for the government to tackle every problem facing this country, no matter how big or how small, from issues with military housing to Puerto Rican debt to climate change.The price tag for this massive expansion of government is enormous. Much of the attention in recent weeks has been focused on Warren’s embrace of Medicare for All, which she refuses to admit would require an increase in middle-class taxes. Even Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has conceded that such proposals, which would cost $30–40 trillion over 10 years, cannot be financed without tax hikes. Warren’s refusal to address this obvious fact makes her look less like a would-be policy wonk and more like a typical politician.But even setting aside Medicare for All, Warren’s plans are likely to dump oceans of red ink onto our growing national debt. Her non-health-care spending proposals already total some $7.5 trillion per year over the next 10 years. Although these are not quite Bernie levels of government largesse, her proposals would still require nearly double our current levels of spending.To pay for all this, Warren proposes a variety of tax hikes, mostly designed to hit corporations or high-earners: higher payroll taxes for those earning more than $250,000 per year; a 7 percent profits tax on companies earning more than $100 million; a 60 percent lobbying tax on firms that spend a million or more on lobbying, and so forth. But the biggest chunk of money would come from Warren’s proposed “wealth tax,” a 2 to 3 percent levy on net worth above $50 million. Warren estimates that this wealth tax will pull in more than $2.75 trillion over ten years. It won’t.First, there is the slight problem that a wealth tax is probably unconstitutional. Of course, constitutional constraints are quaint notions in the Age of Trump. Regardless, it is worth noting that the Constitution permits the federal government to impose only “direct taxes,” such as a property tax. That’s why it required a constitutional amendment to enact the federal income tax. Many constitutional scholars warn that a wealth tax is neither a direct tax nor income tax.Even if Warren can find a way around the constitutional guardrails -- perhaps by something such as a retrospective wealth tax in which you wait until a taxpayer sells assets or passes away -- a wealth tax is unlikely to raise anywhere near the amount of money she predicts.Simply look at Europe’s experiments with wealth taxes. At one time, a dozen European countries imposed wealth taxes. Today, all but three have abandoned those levies. Among those repealing their wealth tax are the Scandinavian social democracies that Warren admires, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Norway retains a wealth tax but has significantly reduced it in recent years. Additional countries abandoning the tax include Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Other countries, such as Great Britain, have considered wealth taxes and rejected them.They did so because wealth taxes are administratively complex and difficult to enforce. Also, they significantly reduce investment, entrepreneurship, and, ultimately, economic growth. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, European wealth taxes raised, on average, only about 0.2 percent of GDP in revenues. By comparison, the U.S. federal income tax raises 8 percent of GDP.Two groups, however, would benefit substantially from a wealth tax. The tax would be a full-employment opportunity for the tax-preparation industry and for lawyers. After all, we would now have to determine fair market value for everything from homes and vehicles to artwork and jewelry to family pension rights and intellectual property. The other big winner would be lobbyists, who could be expected to descend on Washington en masse seeking exemptions and exceptions for their clients. If you think the tax code is a mess today, just wait until D.C. is done with Warren’s plan.There is an old Yiddish proverb that goes “Mann tracht, un Gott Lacht,” or “Man plans, and God laughs.” It is all well and good that Senator Warren has a plan for everything. But until she actually figures out how to pay for everything without crippling our economy, such plans really don’t add up.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/t_XOfhQ2Q8pn0Eihbaza4g--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/710b4188b8e44ebd02c332c03dfb8d66,Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans
Meghan McCain Spars With Cory Booker Over Civility: Beto Was ‘Very Nasty’ to Me!,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:39:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/meghan-mccain-spars-cory-booker-163901660.html,"During a Wednesday interview with Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, The View’s Meghan McCain did what she apparently does best: Make the conversation about herself and, in this case, her personal beef with a presidential hopeful.After applauding Booker for saying Medicare for All is unrealistic, the conservative View co-host took issue with the New Jersey senator’s support for mandatory gun buybacks. This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he’s going to take her brother’s guns.After a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they’d continue the conversation in the next segment.“No we’re not,” McCain grumbled. “It’s fine.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Circuit for the U.S. Court of Appeals on Tuesday night halted the scheduled release of grand-jury materials from Robert Mueller’s investigation, just hours ahead of the scheduled distribution.The decision came after a federal judge ruled last Friday that the Justice Department must release unredacted material from the original Mueller investigation, a move House Democrats have clamored for in the midst of the ongoing impeachment inquiry.Judge Beryl Howell, an Obama appointee, wrote that the committee “has shown that it needs the grand jury material referenced and cited in the Mueller Report to avoid a possible injustice in the impeachment inquiry.”The DOJ contested Howell’s ruling and issued an emergency appeal, saying a quick release “threatens an irreparable loss of grand-jury secrecy before this court even has a chance to act on the Department’s stay motion.” The government also noted that Howell gave no explanation for her seemingly arbitrary deadline of Wednesday, which was not offered by Democrats.The three-judge D.C. panel — made up of judges appointed by Barack Obama — decided on an administrative stay in order “to give the court sufficient opportunity to consider the emergency motion for stay pending appeal and should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits of that motion,” according to the decision.The debate centers around the validity of redactions to a grand-jury deposition, which is usually kept secret. The DOJ argues that materials in the report are squarely protected by federal evidence regulations, while others point to ongoing criminal matters involved, including a probe by Connecticut U.S attorney John Durham the origins of the investigation.

"Former &lt;/&gt;Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:11:25 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/former-time-editor-wants-hate-211125098.html,"A former Time editor claimed that the United States needs a law banning hate speech, and that President Donald Trump “might be in violation of it” if there were one -- because, apparently, he doesn’t notice the irony of holding both of these views at once.In a Tuesday tweet promoting his Washington Post piece, titled “Why America needs a hate speech law,” Richard Stengel stated:> My @WashingtonPost piece on why the very broadness of the First Amendment suggests we should have a hate speech law. And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f> > -- Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019In the piece, Stengel writes that “many nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred” in the wake of World War II:> These laws started out as protections against the kinds of anti-Semitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws, but there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general, hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.“I’m all for protecting ‘thought that we hate,’ but not speech that incites hate,” he continues. “It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.”It’s interesting how Stengel actually does acknowledge the fact that “there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is,” and yet he still wants laws banning it. This makes absolutely no sense. After all, when he calls for laws to ban “hate speech,” he is, inherently, giving the government the power to decide what would and would not qualify -- the exact same government that is led by Donald Trump, and that is full of people who support him.In other words: Stengel somehow trusts that the government will have the same view of “hate speech” as he does, and then, in the same thought, seems to acknowledge that there’s actually no way that many of them would. Unless he thinks that the president and his congressional supporters would actually pass a law that they’d be in violation of, his argument for “hate speech” laws winds up being a pretty great argument against them.It’s ironic, but it’s not new: More often than not, it’s the uber-progressives arguing for laws against “hate speech” -- despite the fact that they’re often the same people who are also arguing that Donald Trump and Republicans are constantly spewing it. Maybe it’s just me, but if I thought that the leader of my government was, you know, literally Hitler or whatever, the last thing that I’d want would be to give that person and their supporters control over my speech.Yes, the First Amendment gives us the right to be “offensive” with our speech. Given the fact that a new thing seems to be declared “racist” or “sexist” every day, I’m certainly glad that we do have this protection. After all, it would only take there being a few too many of the “super woke” in our government for a phrase like “you guys” to become a criminal offense.The truth is, though, the right to be “offensive” (however you define that subjective term, anyway) is not even the most important role that our First Amendment plays. No, what’s most important is that it protects our right to speak out against the government when we see fit -- without having to worry about its retaliation. Like it or not, the only way to ensure that we retain this important check on government power is to never (ever) give its leaders a vehicle take it away.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eTNessteMBpuBTcqmJGuYw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/bae9af12e23cce197b317b5c1be56053,"Former </>Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony"

"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:17:36 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/record-wave-lone-child-migrants-122133758.html,"TENOSIQUE, Mexico -- The United States has detained more children trying to cross the nation's southwest border on their own over the last year than during any other period on record, surpassing the surge of unaccompanied minors that set off a crisis during the Obama administration, according to new figures released Tuesday.U.S. immigration authorities apprehended 76,020 minors, most of them from Central America, traveling without their parents in the fiscal year that ended in September -- 52% more than during the last fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Mexico is experiencing the same surge. Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period -- pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.In interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous -- and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.""These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,"" Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters. ""And each month during the fiscal year, the numbers increased. You saw them. We all saw them.""The young migrants came alongside a historic wave of families traveling together, also largely from Central America. They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.Marvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced -- and he pressed on.""Quitting was not an option,"" Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. ""You wipe your tears and carry on.""For the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they'd kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.His parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said. ""We can't bear losing another son,"" they told him. ""You have to go.""He left home in the spring, with $40 in his pocket and no plan except to find work in a safer place.As for most underage migrants traveling without their parents, his trip north has been a feat of improvisation and courage. He walked and hitchhiked through Honduras and Guatemala. He slept in churches, under trees or wherever he found himself when night fell.Along the way, he gathered crucial bits of information from fellow migrants: the best route to take, locations of shelters up ahead, places to avoid, where to forage for food.As huge numbers of young migrants from Central America began arriving at the United States' southern border in 2014, the Obama administration scrambled to house them until they could be released to sponsors -- adults who applied to care for them. The shelter system grew dramatically as a result.The Trump administration experienced similar backups at the border just a few years later -- this time because of new, more stringent policies that made the sponsors themselves, who are often undocumented, vulnerable to immigration authorities. This discouraged people from coming forward, leaving thousands of children to languish in the system.The Trump administration has also sought to deter migration by separating thousands of children from their relatives, again driving up the number of children in federally contracted shelters.On the road, while trying to avoid detention, fear and hunger are constant companions for many young migrants.With little or no money in their pockets, they relied on strangers for snacks or meals. They pawed through garbage and scanned drifts of debris on the roadside, hoping to spot an edible morsel.Wilson, a 17-year-old Honduran, said he had feasted on rotten mangos discarded by street vendors.""I used to drink water from potholes when I was too thirsty,"" interjected Mario Leonel, 16, who left home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, several weeks ago without notifying his parents. ""That is the hardest part of it all: the hunger.""When he arrived at the shelter in Tenosique, a small Mexican town near the Guatemala border, he called his parents in Honduras, who burst into tears and pleaded for him to return. He said no. He was tired of all the violence in his country, and wanted to get asylum in the United States.After Marvel slipped across the Guatemala-Mexico border in May, he found room at a shelter in Tenosique, which serves as a transit point for many migrants. He quickly made new friends among other teenage migrants who had made it this far, mainly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador.On a recent afternoon, several of them gathered in a two-story building that had been reserved for minors, its walls painted with colorful animal murals. The boys cracked jokes, roughhoused and argued about who was the cutest girl in the shelter.Outside, Dulce, a 16-year-old transgender migrant from Guatemala, sat alone on train tracks pining for a boy she had met at the shelter. He had left without explanation and she was lovesick.""I just can't get him out of my mind,"" she said.She left her hometown four months earlier to escape abuse from her family and strangers, including a sexual assault by gang members when she was 12. She made it as far as central Mexico before being detained and deported. Five days after returning home, she set off again.""I left because I had nothing there and no one to protect me,"" she said. ""At least here I am safe.""Though the United States remains the destination of choice for most unaccompanied minors, an increasing number are setting their sights no farther than Mexico, advocates and migrants say.Sometimes they have no choice: Mexico's increased enforcement measures have made it more difficult for migrants to make it to the border with the United States. And even if they reach the United States, recent policies have drastically lowered the possibilities of getting asylum.In Mexico, when unaccompanied minors are detained, the law mandates that they be released right away into the custody of the national child protection agency, which finds them accommodation in shelters designed for children.But migrants' advocates say the government has been holding children in the nation's overcrowded detention centers for far too long, and that some children are quickly funneled into the deportation process rather than being given a fair chance to seek asylum or some other form of relief.""No child should ever be held at a detention center,"" said Elba Coria, a migration expert from the Clinic for Refugees at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City. ""But while international standards consider children's detention as an exceptional measure, amid Mexico's migration chaos, it is the rule.""Neither Marvel nor any of his new friends in the Tenosique shelter had been detained by the authorities. All had managed to cross into Mexico from Guatemala and had applied for asylum in Mexico after talking through their options with the shelter staff.They now plan to remain in Mexico and look for work and study opportunities -- even if they haven't abandoned hope of making it to the United States.""It is every Honduran's boy dream to get to the United States, where there is more money and kids are able to go to school,"" said Jose Angel, 17. He was born with a disability that left him unable to use his arms and left his hometown because his grandmother could no longer take care of him.He was hopeful he could apply for asylum in the United States despite Trump's many efforts to severely lower the number of people granted asylum. ""It is scary, but you have to take a chance,"" he said.On a recent morning, Alan, a 17-year-old Guatemalan migrant, sat on the sidewalk outside a migrant shelter in the city of Palenque, in southern Mexico. He had just crossed the border and was exhausted. Mexican immigration officials had stopped a bus he was on, but he managed to escape into the countryside and hide.Alan planned to take a nap, shower and have a meal before trying illegally to board a freight train known as The Beast. It runs from Mexico's border with Guatemala to its border with the United States and, for decades, migrants have clung to it to speed through much of Mexico.His hope was to make it to the U.S. border and petition for asylum. He was undeterred by Trump's recent efforts to restrict asylum claims or curb immigration.""One way or another, I have to make it to the other side where there are skyscrapers and life is better,"" he said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5ol82jExNHqBHa7IGzz2mw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/03f35d3f9d537a8dc9fe503d06c098de,"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation"
Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 10:05:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-warren-untenable-plans-140521979.html,"If you’ve been having trouble finding someone to walk your dog, don’t worry. Any day now, Elizabeth Warren will announce “a plan for that.” It will undoubtedly be comprehensive, detailed, and replete with subsidies for lower- and middle-class dog walkers and underserved breeds. It will cost tens of billions of dollars and will receive widespread positive notice from the media. However, to judge by her other recent plans, the one thing it won’t include is any discussion of how she plans to pay for it.The Massachusetts senator has challenged and possibly overtaken former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, largely based on having a plan for the government to tackle every problem facing this country, no matter how big or how small, from issues with military housing to Puerto Rican debt to climate change.The price tag for this massive expansion of government is enormous. Much of the attention in recent weeks has been focused on Warren’s embrace of Medicare for All, which she refuses to admit would require an increase in middle-class taxes. Even Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has conceded that such proposals, which would cost $30–40 trillion over 10 years, cannot be financed without tax hikes. Warren’s refusal to address this obvious fact makes her look less like a would-be policy wonk and more like a typical politician.But even setting aside Medicare for All, Warren’s plans are likely to dump oceans of red ink onto our growing national debt. Her non-health-care spending proposals already total some $7.5 trillion per year over the next 10 years. Although these are not quite Bernie levels of government largesse, her proposals would still require nearly double our current levels of spending.To pay for all this, Warren proposes a variety of tax hikes, mostly designed to hit corporations or high-earners: higher payroll taxes for those earning more than $250,000 per year; a 7 percent profits tax on companies earning more than $100 million; a 60 percent lobbying tax on firms that spend a million or more on lobbying, and so forth. But the biggest chunk of money would come from Warren’s proposed “wealth tax,” a 2 to 3 percent levy on net worth above $50 million. Warren estimates that this wealth tax will pull in more than $2.75 trillion over ten years. It won’t.First, there is the slight problem that a wealth tax is probably unconstitutional. Of course, constitutional constraints are quaint notions in the Age of Trump. Regardless, it is worth noting that the Constitution permits the federal government to impose only “direct taxes,” such as a property tax. That’s why it required a constitutional amendment to enact the federal income tax. Many constitutional scholars warn that a wealth tax is neither a direct tax nor income tax.Even if Warren can find a way around the constitutional guardrails -- perhaps by something such as a retrospective wealth tax in which you wait until a taxpayer sells assets or passes away -- a wealth tax is unlikely to raise anywhere near the amount of money she predicts.Simply look at Europe’s experiments with wealth taxes. At one time, a dozen European countries imposed wealth taxes. Today, all but three have abandoned those levies. Among those repealing their wealth tax are the Scandinavian social democracies that Warren admires, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Norway retains a wealth tax but has significantly reduced it in recent years. Additional countries abandoning the tax include Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Other countries, such as Great Britain, have considered wealth taxes and rejected them.They did so because wealth taxes are administratively complex and difficult to enforce. Also, they significantly reduce investment, entrepreneurship, and, ultimately, economic growth. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, European wealth taxes raised, on average, only about 0.2 percent of GDP in revenues. By comparison, the U.S. federal income tax raises 8 percent of GDP.Two groups, however, would benefit substantially from a wealth tax. The tax would be a full-employment opportunity for the tax-preparation industry and for lawyers. After all, we would now have to determine fair market value for everything from homes and vehicles to artwork and jewelry to family pension rights and intellectual property. The other big winner would be lobbyists, who could be expected to descend on Washington en masse seeking exemptions and exceptions for their clients. If you think the tax code is a mess today, just wait until D.C. is done with Warren’s plan.There is an old Yiddish proverb that goes “Mann tracht, un Gott Lacht,” or “Man plans, and God laughs.” It is all well and good that Senator Warren has a plan for everything. But until she actually figures out how to pay for everything without crippling our economy, such plans really don’t add up.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/t_XOfhQ2Q8pn0Eihbaza4g--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/710b4188b8e44ebd02c332c03dfb8d66,Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans
Meghan McCain Spars With Cory Booker Over Civility: Beto Was ‘Very Nasty’ to Me!,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:39:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/meghan-mccain-spars-cory-booker-163901660.html,"During a Wednesday interview with Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, The View’s Meghan McCain did what she apparently does best: Make the conversation about herself and, in this case, her personal beef with a presidential hopeful.After applauding Booker for saying Medicare for All is unrealistic, the conservative View co-host took issue with the New Jersey senator’s support for mandatory gun buybacks. This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he’s going to take her brother’s guns.After a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they’d continue the conversation in the next segment.“No we’re not,” McCain grumbled. “It’s fine.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Circuit for the U.S. Court of Appeals on Tuesday night halted the scheduled release of grand-jury materials from Robert Mueller’s investigation, just hours ahead of the scheduled distribution.The decision came after a federal judge ruled last Friday that the Justice Department must release unredacted material from the original Mueller investigation, a move House Democrats have clamored for in the midst of the ongoing impeachment inquiry.Judge Beryl Howell, an Obama appointee, wrote that the committee “has shown that it needs the grand jury material referenced and cited in the Mueller Report to avoid a possible injustice in the impeachment inquiry.”The DOJ contested Howell’s ruling and issued an emergency appeal, saying a quick release “threatens an irreparable loss of grand-jury secrecy before this court even has a chance to act on the Department’s stay motion.” The government also noted that Howell gave no explanation for her seemingly arbitrary deadline of Wednesday, which was not offered by Democrats.The three-judge D.C. panel — made up of judges appointed by Barack Obama — decided on an administrative stay in order “to give the court sufficient opportunity to consider the emergency motion for stay pending appeal and should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits of that motion,” according to the decision.The debate centers around the validity of redactions to a grand-jury deposition, which is usually kept secret. The DOJ argues that materials in the report are squarely protected by federal evidence regulations, while others point to ongoing criminal matters involved, including a probe by Connecticut U.S attorney John Durham the origins of the investigation.

"Former &lt;/&gt;Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:11:25 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/former-time-editor-wants-hate-211125098.html,"A former Time editor claimed that the United States needs a law banning hate speech, and that President Donald Trump “might be in violation of it” if there were one -- because, apparently, he doesn’t notice the irony of holding both of these views at once.In a Tuesday tweet promoting his Washington Post piece, titled “Why America needs a hate speech law,” Richard Stengel stated:> My @WashingtonPost piece on why the very broadness of the First Amendment suggests we should have a hate speech law. And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f> > -- Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019In the piece, Stengel writes that “many nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred” in the wake of World War II:> These laws started out as protections against the kinds of anti-Semitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws, but there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general, hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.“I’m all for protecting ‘thought that we hate,’ but not speech that incites hate,” he continues. “It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.”It’s interesting how Stengel actually does acknowledge the fact that “there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is,” and yet he still wants laws banning it. This makes absolutely no sense. After all, when he calls for laws to ban “hate speech,” he is, inherently, giving the government the power to decide what would and would not qualify -- the exact same government that is led by Donald Trump, and that is full of people who support him.In other words: Stengel somehow trusts that the government will have the same view of “hate speech” as he does, and then, in the same thought, seems to acknowledge that there’s actually no way that many of them would. Unless he thinks that the president and his congressional supporters would actually pass a law that they’d be in violation of, his argument for “hate speech” laws winds up being a pretty great argument against them.It’s ironic, but it’s not new: More often than not, it’s the uber-progressives arguing for laws against “hate speech” -- despite the fact that they’re often the same people who are also arguing that Donald Trump and Republicans are constantly spewing it. Maybe it’s just me, but if I thought that the leader of my government was, you know, literally Hitler or whatever, the last thing that I’d want would be to give that person and their supporters control over my speech.Yes, the First Amendment gives us the right to be “offensive” with our speech. Given the fact that a new thing seems to be declared “racist” or “sexist” every day, I’m certainly glad that we do have this protection. After all, it would only take there being a few too many of the “super woke” in our government for a phrase like “you guys” to become a criminal offense.The truth is, though, the right to be “offensive” (however you define that subjective term, anyway) is not even the most important role that our First Amendment plays. No, what’s most important is that it protects our right to speak out against the government when we see fit -- without having to worry about its retaliation. Like it or not, the only way to ensure that we retain this important check on government power is to never (ever) give its leaders a vehicle take it away.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eTNessteMBpuBTcqmJGuYw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/bae9af12e23cce197b317b5c1be56053,"Former </>Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony"

"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:17:36 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/record-wave-lone-child-migrants-122133758.html,"TENOSIQUE, Mexico -- The United States has detained more children trying to cross the nation's southwest border on their own over the last year than during any other period on record, surpassing the surge of unaccompanied minors that set off a crisis during the Obama administration, according to new figures released Tuesday.U.S. immigration authorities apprehended 76,020 minors, most of them from Central America, traveling without their parents in the fiscal year that ended in September -- 52% more than during the last fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Mexico is experiencing the same surge. Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period -- pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.In interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous -- and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.""These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,"" Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters. ""And each month during the fiscal year, the numbers increased. You saw them. We all saw them.""The young migrants came alongside a historic wave of families traveling together, also largely from Central America. They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.Marvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced -- and he pressed on.""Quitting was not an option,"" Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. ""You wipe your tears and carry on.""For the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they'd kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.His parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said. ""We can't bear losing another son,"" they told him. ""You have to go.""He left home in the spring, with $40 in his pocket and no plan except to find work in a safer place.As for most underage migrants traveling without their parents, his trip north has been a feat of improvisation and courage. He walked and hitchhiked through Honduras and Guatemala. He slept in churches, under trees or wherever he found himself when night fell.Along the way, he gathered crucial bits of information from fellow migrants: the best route to take, locations of shelters up ahead, places to avoid, where to forage for food.As huge numbers of young migrants from Central America began arriving at the United States' southern border in 2014, the Obama administration scrambled to house them until they could be released to sponsors -- adults who applied to care for them. The shelter system grew dramatically as a result.The Trump administration experienced similar backups at the border just a few years later -- this time because of new, more stringent policies that made the sponsors themselves, who are often undocumented, vulnerable to immigration authorities. This discouraged people from coming forward, leaving thousands of children to languish in the system.The Trump administration has also sought to deter migration by separating thousands of children from their relatives, again driving up the number of children in federally contracted shelters.On the road, while trying to avoid detention, fear and hunger are constant companions for many young migrants.With little or no money in their pockets, they relied on strangers for snacks or meals. They pawed through garbage and scanned drifts of debris on the roadside, hoping to spot an edible morsel.Wilson, a 17-year-old Honduran, said he had feasted on rotten mangos discarded by street vendors.""I used to drink water from potholes when I was too thirsty,"" interjected Mario Leonel, 16, who left home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, several weeks ago without notifying his parents. ""That is the hardest part of it all: the hunger.""When he arrived at the shelter in Tenosique, a small Mexican town near the Guatemala border, he called his parents in Honduras, who burst into tears and pleaded for him to return. He said no. He was tired of all the violence in his country, and wanted to get asylum in the United States.After Marvel slipped across the Guatemala-Mexico border in May, he found room at a shelter in Tenosique, which serves as a transit point for many migrants. He quickly made new friends among other teenage migrants who had made it this far, mainly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador.On a recent afternoon, several of them gathered in a two-story building that had been reserved for minors, its walls painted with colorful animal murals. The boys cracked jokes, roughhoused and argued about who was the cutest girl in the shelter.Outside, Dulce, a 16-year-old transgender migrant from Guatemala, sat alone on train tracks pining for a boy she had met at the shelter. He had left without explanation and she was lovesick.""I just can't get him out of my mind,"" she said.She left her hometown four months earlier to escape abuse from her family and strangers, including a sexual assault by gang members when she was 12. She made it as far as central Mexico before being detained and deported. Five days after returning home, she set off again.""I left because I had nothing there and no one to protect me,"" she said. ""At least here I am safe.""Though the United States remains the destination of choice for most unaccompanied minors, an increasing number are setting their sights no farther than Mexico, advocates and migrants say.Sometimes they have no choice: Mexico's increased enforcement measures have made it more difficult for migrants to make it to the border with the United States. And even if they reach the United States, recent policies have drastically lowered the possibilities of getting asylum.In Mexico, when unaccompanied minors are detained, the law mandates that they be released right away into the custody of the national child protection agency, which finds them accommodation in shelters designed for children.But migrants' advocates say the government has been holding children in the nation's overcrowded detention centers for far too long, and that some children are quickly funneled into the deportation process rather than being given a fair chance to seek asylum or some other form of relief.""No child should ever be held at a detention center,"" said Elba Coria, a migration expert from the Clinic for Refugees at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City. ""But while international standards consider children's detention as an exceptional measure, amid Mexico's migration chaos, it is the rule.""Neither Marvel nor any of his new friends in the Tenosique shelter had been detained by the authorities. All had managed to cross into Mexico from Guatemala and had applied for asylum in Mexico after talking through their options with the shelter staff.They now plan to remain in Mexico and look for work and study opportunities -- even if they haven't abandoned hope of making it to the United States.""It is every Honduran's boy dream to get to the United States, where there is more money and kids are able to go to school,"" said Jose Angel, 17. He was born with a disability that left him unable to use his arms and left his hometown because his grandmother could no longer take care of him.He was hopeful he could apply for asylum in the United States despite Trump's many efforts to severely lower the number of people granted asylum. ""It is scary, but you have to take a chance,"" he said.On a recent morning, Alan, a 17-year-old Guatemalan migrant, sat on the sidewalk outside a migrant shelter in the city of Palenque, in southern Mexico. He had just crossed the border and was exhausted. Mexican immigration officials had stopped a bus he was on, but he managed to escape into the countryside and hide.Alan planned to take a nap, shower and have a meal before trying illegally to board a freight train known as The Beast. It runs from Mexico's border with Guatemala to its border with the United States and, for decades, migrants have clung to it to speed through much of Mexico.His hope was to make it to the U.S. border and petition for asylum. He was undeterred by Trump's recent efforts to restrict asylum claims or curb immigration.""One way or another, I have to make it to the other side where there are skyscrapers and life is better,"" he said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5ol82jExNHqBHa7IGzz2mw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/03f35d3f9d537a8dc9fe503d06c098de,"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation"
Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 10:05:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-warren-untenable-plans-140521979.html,"If you’ve been having trouble finding someone to walk your dog, don’t worry. Any day now, Elizabeth Warren will announce “a plan for that.” It will undoubtedly be comprehensive, detailed, and replete with subsidies for lower- and middle-class dog walkers and underserved breeds. It will cost tens of billions of dollars and will receive widespread positive notice from the media. However, to judge by her other recent plans, the one thing it won’t include is any discussion of how she plans to pay for it.The Massachusetts senator has challenged and possibly overtaken former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, largely based on having a plan for the government to tackle every problem facing this country, no matter how big or how small, from issues with military housing to Puerto Rican debt to climate change.The price tag for this massive expansion of government is enormous. Much of the attention in recent weeks has been focused on Warren’s embrace of Medicare for All, which she refuses to admit would require an increase in middle-class taxes. Even Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has conceded that such proposals, which would cost $30–40 trillion over 10 years, cannot be financed without tax hikes. Warren’s refusal to address this obvious fact makes her look less like a would-be policy wonk and more like a typical politician.But even setting aside Medicare for All, Warren’s plans are likely to dump oceans of red ink onto our growing national debt. Her non-health-care spending proposals already total some $7.5 trillion per year over the next 10 years. Although these are not quite Bernie levels of government largesse, her proposals would still require nearly double our current levels of spending.To pay for all this, Warren proposes a variety of tax hikes, mostly designed to hit corporations or high-earners: higher payroll taxes for those earning more than $250,000 per year; a 7 percent profits tax on companies earning more than $100 million; a 60 percent lobbying tax on firms that spend a million or more on lobbying, and so forth. But the biggest chunk of money would come from Warren’s proposed “wealth tax,” a 2 to 3 percent levy on net worth above $50 million. Warren estimates that this wealth tax will pull in more than $2.75 trillion over ten years. It won’t.First, there is the slight problem that a wealth tax is probably unconstitutional. Of course, constitutional constraints are quaint notions in the Age of Trump. Regardless, it is worth noting that the Constitution permits the federal government to impose only “direct taxes,” such as a property tax. That’s why it required a constitutional amendment to enact the federal income tax. Many constitutional scholars warn that a wealth tax is neither a direct tax nor income tax.Even if Warren can find a way around the constitutional guardrails -- perhaps by something such as a retrospective wealth tax in which you wait until a taxpayer sells assets or passes away -- a wealth tax is unlikely to raise anywhere near the amount of money she predicts.Simply look at Europe’s experiments with wealth taxes. At one time, a dozen European countries imposed wealth taxes. Today, all but three have abandoned those levies. Among those repealing their wealth tax are the Scandinavian social democracies that Warren admires, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Norway retains a wealth tax but has significantly reduced it in recent years. Additional countries abandoning the tax include Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Other countries, such as Great Britain, have considered wealth taxes and rejected them.They did so because wealth taxes are administratively complex and difficult to enforce. Also, they significantly reduce investment, entrepreneurship, and, ultimately, economic growth. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, European wealth taxes raised, on average, only about 0.2 percent of GDP in revenues. By comparison, the U.S. federal income tax raises 8 percent of GDP.Two groups, however, would benefit substantially from a wealth tax. The tax would be a full-employment opportunity for the tax-preparation industry and for lawyers. After all, we would now have to determine fair market value for everything from homes and vehicles to artwork and jewelry to family pension rights and intellectual property. The other big winner would be lobbyists, who could be expected to descend on Washington en masse seeking exemptions and exceptions for their clients. If you think the tax code is a mess today, just wait until D.C. is done with Warren’s plan.There is an old Yiddish proverb that goes “Mann tracht, un Gott Lacht,” or “Man plans, and God laughs.” It is all well and good that Senator Warren has a plan for everything. But until she actually figures out how to pay for everything without crippling our economy, such plans really don’t add up.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/t_XOfhQ2Q8pn0Eihbaza4g--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/710b4188b8e44ebd02c332c03dfb8d66,Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans
Meghan McCain Spars With Cory Booker Over Civility: Beto Was ‘Very Nasty’ to Me!,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:39:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/meghan-mccain-spars-cory-booker-163901660.html,"During a Wednesday interview with Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, The View’s Meghan McCain did what she apparently does best: Make the conversation about herself and, in this case, her personal beef with a presidential hopeful.After applauding Booker for saying Medicare for All is unrealistic, the conservative View co-host took issue with the New Jersey senator’s support for mandatory gun buybacks. This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he’s going to take her brother’s guns.After a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they’d continue the conversation in the next segment.“No we’re not,” McCain grumbled. “It’s fine.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Circuit for the U.S. Court of Appeals on Tuesday night halted the scheduled release of grand-jury materials from Robert Mueller’s investigation, just hours ahead of the scheduled distribution.The decision came after a federal judge ruled last Friday that the Justice Department must release unredacted material from the original Mueller investigation, a move House Democrats have clamored for in the midst of the ongoing impeachment inquiry.Judge Beryl Howell, an Obama appointee, wrote that the committee “has shown that it needs the grand jury material referenced and cited in the Mueller Report to avoid a possible injustice in the impeachment inquiry.”The DOJ contested Howell’s ruling and issued an emergency appeal, saying a quick release “threatens an irreparable loss of grand-jury secrecy before this court even has a chance to act on the Department’s stay motion.” The government also noted that Howell gave no explanation for her seemingly arbitrary deadline of Wednesday, which was not offered by Democrats.The three-judge D.C. panel — made up of judges appointed by Barack Obama — decided on an administrative stay in order “to give the court sufficient opportunity to consider the emergency motion for stay pending appeal and should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits of that motion,” according to the decision.The debate centers around the validity of redactions to a grand-jury deposition, which is usually kept secret. The DOJ argues that materials in the report are squarely protected by federal evidence regulations, while others point to ongoing criminal matters involved, including a probe by Connecticut U.S attorney John Durham the origins of the investigation.

"Former &lt;/&gt;Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:11:25 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/former-time-editor-wants-hate-211125098.html,"A former Time editor claimed that the United States needs a law banning hate speech, and that President Donald Trump “might be in violation of it” if there were one -- because, apparently, he doesn’t notice the irony of holding both of these views at once.In a Tuesday tweet promoting his Washington Post piece, titled “Why America needs a hate speech law,” Richard Stengel stated:> My @WashingtonPost piece on why the very broadness of the First Amendment suggests we should have a hate speech law. And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f> > -- Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019In the piece, Stengel writes that “many nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred” in the wake of World War II:> These laws started out as protections against the kinds of anti-Semitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws, but there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general, hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.“I’m all for protecting ‘thought that we hate,’ but not speech that incites hate,” he continues. “It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.”It’s interesting how Stengel actually does acknowledge the fact that “there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is,” and yet he still wants laws banning it. This makes absolutely no sense. After all, when he calls for laws to ban “hate speech,” he is, inherently, giving the government the power to decide what would and would not qualify -- the exact same government that is led by Donald Trump, and that is full of people who support him.In other words: Stengel somehow trusts that the government will have the same view of “hate speech” as he does, and then, in the same thought, seems to acknowledge that there’s actually no way that many of them would. Unless he thinks that the president and his congressional supporters would actually pass a law that they’d be in violation of, his argument for “hate speech” laws winds up being a pretty great argument against them.It’s ironic, but it’s not new: More often than not, it’s the uber-progressives arguing for laws against “hate speech” -- despite the fact that they’re often the same people who are also arguing that Donald Trump and Republicans are constantly spewing it. Maybe it’s just me, but if I thought that the leader of my government was, you know, literally Hitler or whatever, the last thing that I’d want would be to give that person and their supporters control over my speech.Yes, the First Amendment gives us the right to be “offensive” with our speech. Given the fact that a new thing seems to be declared “racist” or “sexist” every day, I’m certainly glad that we do have this protection. After all, it would only take there being a few too many of the “super woke” in our government for a phrase like “you guys” to become a criminal offense.The truth is, though, the right to be “offensive” (however you define that subjective term, anyway) is not even the most important role that our First Amendment plays. No, what’s most important is that it protects our right to speak out against the government when we see fit -- without having to worry about its retaliation. Like it or not, the only way to ensure that we retain this important check on government power is to never (ever) give its leaders a vehicle take it away.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eTNessteMBpuBTcqmJGuYw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/bae9af12e23cce197b317b5c1be56053,"Former </>Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony"

"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:17:36 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/record-wave-lone-child-migrants-122133758.html,"TENOSIQUE, Mexico -- The United States has detained more children trying to cross the nation's southwest border on their own over the last year than during any other period on record, surpassing the surge of unaccompanied minors that set off a crisis during the Obama administration, according to new figures released Tuesday.U.S. immigration authorities apprehended 76,020 minors, most of them from Central America, traveling without their parents in the fiscal year that ended in September -- 52% more than during the last fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Mexico is experiencing the same surge. Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period -- pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.In interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous -- and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.""These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,"" Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters. ""And each month during the fiscal year, the numbers increased. You saw them. We all saw them.""The young migrants came alongside a historic wave of families traveling together, also largely from Central America. They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.Marvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced -- and he pressed on.""Quitting was not an option,"" Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. ""You wipe your tears and carry on.""For the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they'd kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.His parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said. ""We can't bear losing another son,"" they told him. ""You have to go.""He left home in the spring, with $40 in his pocket and no plan except to find work in a safer place.As for most underage migrants traveling without their parents, his trip north has been a feat of improvisation and courage. He walked and hitchhiked through Honduras and Guatemala. He slept in churches, under trees or wherever he found himself when night fell.Along the way, he gathered crucial bits of information from fellow migrants: the best route to take, locations of shelters up ahead, places to avoid, where to forage for food.As huge numbers of young migrants from Central America began arriving at the United States' southern border in 2014, the Obama administration scrambled to house them until they could be released to sponsors -- adults who applied to care for them. The shelter system grew dramatically as a result.The Trump administration experienced similar backups at the border just a few years later -- this time because of new, more stringent policies that made the sponsors themselves, who are often undocumented, vulnerable to immigration authorities. This discouraged people from coming forward, leaving thousands of children to languish in the system.The Trump administration has also sought to deter migration by separating thousands of children from their relatives, again driving up the number of children in federally contracted shelters.On the road, while trying to avoid detention, fear and hunger are constant companions for many young migrants.With little or no money in their pockets, they relied on strangers for snacks or meals. They pawed through garbage and scanned drifts of debris on the roadside, hoping to spot an edible morsel.Wilson, a 17-year-old Honduran, said he had feasted on rotten mangos discarded by street vendors.""I used to drink water from potholes when I was too thirsty,"" interjected Mario Leonel, 16, who left home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, several weeks ago without notifying his parents. ""That is the hardest part of it all: the hunger.""When he arrived at the shelter in Tenosique, a small Mexican town near the Guatemala border, he called his parents in Honduras, who burst into tears and pleaded for him to return. He said no. He was tired of all the violence in his country, and wanted to get asylum in the United States.After Marvel slipped across the Guatemala-Mexico border in May, he found room at a shelter in Tenosique, which serves as a transit point for many migrants. He quickly made new friends among other teenage migrants who had made it this far, mainly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador.On a recent afternoon, several of them gathered in a two-story building that had been reserved for minors, its walls painted with colorful animal murals. The boys cracked jokes, roughhoused and argued about who was the cutest girl in the shelter.Outside, Dulce, a 16-year-old transgender migrant from Guatemala, sat alone on train tracks pining for a boy she had met at the shelter. He had left without explanation and she was lovesick.""I just can't get him out of my mind,"" she said.She left her hometown four months earlier to escape abuse from her family and strangers, including a sexual assault by gang members when she was 12. She made it as far as central Mexico before being detained and deported. Five days after returning home, she set off again.""I left because I had nothing there and no one to protect me,"" she said. ""At least here I am safe.""Though the United States remains the destination of choice for most unaccompanied minors, an increasing number are setting their sights no farther than Mexico, advocates and migrants say.Sometimes they have no choice: Mexico's increased enforcement measures have made it more difficult for migrants to make it to the border with the United States. And even if they reach the United States, recent policies have drastically lowered the possibilities of getting asylum.In Mexico, when unaccompanied minors are detained, the law mandates that they be released right away into the custody of the national child protection agency, which finds them accommodation in shelters designed for children.But migrants' advocates say the government has been holding children in the nation's overcrowded detention centers for far too long, and that some children are quickly funneled into the deportation process rather than being given a fair chance to seek asylum or some other form of relief.""No child should ever be held at a detention center,"" said Elba Coria, a migration expert from the Clinic for Refugees at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City. ""But while international standards consider children's detention as an exceptional measure, amid Mexico's migration chaos, it is the rule.""Neither Marvel nor any of his new friends in the Tenosique shelter had been detained by the authorities. All had managed to cross into Mexico from Guatemala and had applied for asylum in Mexico after talking through their options with the shelter staff.They now plan to remain in Mexico and look for work and study opportunities -- even if they haven't abandoned hope of making it to the United States.""It is every Honduran's boy dream to get to the United States, where there is more money and kids are able to go to school,"" said Jose Angel, 17. He was born with a disability that left him unable to use his arms and left his hometown because his grandmother could no longer take care of him.He was hopeful he could apply for asylum in the United States despite Trump's many efforts to severely lower the number of people granted asylum. ""It is scary, but you have to take a chance,"" he said.On a recent morning, Alan, a 17-year-old Guatemalan migrant, sat on the sidewalk outside a migrant shelter in the city of Palenque, in southern Mexico. He had just crossed the border and was exhausted. Mexican immigration officials had stopped a bus he was on, but he managed to escape into the countryside and hide.Alan planned to take a nap, shower and have a meal before trying illegally to board a freight train known as The Beast. It runs from Mexico's border with Guatemala to its border with the United States and, for decades, migrants have clung to it to speed through much of Mexico.His hope was to make it to the U.S. border and petition for asylum. He was undeterred by Trump's recent efforts to restrict asylum claims or curb immigration.""One way or another, I have to make it to the other side where there are skyscrapers and life is better,"" he said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5ol82jExNHqBHa7IGzz2mw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/03f35d3f9d537a8dc9fe503d06c098de,"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation"
Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 10:05:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-warren-untenable-plans-140521979.html,"If you’ve been having trouble finding someone to walk your dog, don’t worry. Any day now, Elizabeth Warren will announce “a plan for that.” It will undoubtedly be comprehensive, detailed, and replete with subsidies for lower- and middle-class dog walkers and underserved breeds. It will cost tens of billions of dollars and will receive widespread positive notice from the media. However, to judge by her other recent plans, the one thing it won’t include is any discussion of how she plans to pay for it.The Massachusetts senator has challenged and possibly overtaken former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, largely based on having a plan for the government to tackle every problem facing this country, no matter how big or how small, from issues with military housing to Puerto Rican debt to climate change.The price tag for this massive expansion of government is enormous. Much of the attention in recent weeks has been focused on Warren’s embrace of Medicare for All, which she refuses to admit would require an increase in middle-class taxes. Even Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has conceded that such proposals, which would cost $30–40 trillion over 10 years, cannot be financed without tax hikes. Warren’s refusal to address this obvious fact makes her look less like a would-be policy wonk and more like a typical politician.But even setting aside Medicare for All, Warren’s plans are likely to dump oceans of red ink onto our growing national debt. Her non-health-care spending proposals already total some $7.5 trillion per year over the next 10 years. Although these are not quite Bernie levels of government largesse, her proposals would still require nearly double our current levels of spending.To pay for all this, Warren proposes a variety of tax hikes, mostly designed to hit corporations or high-earners: higher payroll taxes for those earning more than $250,000 per year; a 7 percent profits tax on companies earning more than $100 million; a 60 percent lobbying tax on firms that spend a million or more on lobbying, and so forth. But the biggest chunk of money would come from Warren’s proposed “wealth tax,” a 2 to 3 percent levy on net worth above $50 million. Warren estimates that this wealth tax will pull in more than $2.75 trillion over ten years. It won’t.First, there is the slight problem that a wealth tax is probably unconstitutional. Of course, constitutional constraints are quaint notions in the Age of Trump. Regardless, it is worth noting that the Constitution permits the federal government to impose only “direct taxes,” such as a property tax. That’s why it required a constitutional amendment to enact the federal income tax. Many constitutional scholars warn that a wealth tax is neither a direct tax nor income tax.Even if Warren can find a way around the constitutional guardrails -- perhaps by something such as a retrospective wealth tax in which you wait until a taxpayer sells assets or passes away -- a wealth tax is unlikely to raise anywhere near the amount of money she predicts.Simply look at Europe’s experiments with wealth taxes. At one time, a dozen European countries imposed wealth taxes. Today, all but three have abandoned those levies. Among those repealing their wealth tax are the Scandinavian social democracies that Warren admires, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Norway retains a wealth tax but has significantly reduced it in recent years. Additional countries abandoning the tax include Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Other countries, such as Great Britain, have considered wealth taxes and rejected them.They did so because wealth taxes are administratively complex and difficult to enforce. Also, they significantly reduce investment, entrepreneurship, and, ultimately, economic growth. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, European wealth taxes raised, on average, only about 0.2 percent of GDP in revenues. By comparison, the U.S. federal income tax raises 8 percent of GDP.Two groups, however, would benefit substantially from a wealth tax. The tax would be a full-employment opportunity for the tax-preparation industry and for lawyers. After all, we would now have to determine fair market value for everything from homes and vehicles to artwork and jewelry to family pension rights and intellectual property. The other big winner would be lobbyists, who could be expected to descend on Washington en masse seeking exemptions and exceptions for their clients. If you think the tax code is a mess today, just wait until D.C. is done with Warren’s plan.There is an old Yiddish proverb that goes “Mann tracht, un Gott Lacht,” or “Man plans, and God laughs.” It is all well and good that Senator Warren has a plan for everything. But until she actually figures out how to pay for everything without crippling our economy, such plans really don’t add up.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/t_XOfhQ2Q8pn0Eihbaza4g--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/710b4188b8e44ebd02c332c03dfb8d66,Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans
Meghan McCain Spars With Cory Booker Over Civility: Beto Was ‘Very Nasty’ to Me!,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:39:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/meghan-mccain-spars-cory-booker-163901660.html,"During a Wednesday interview with Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, The View’s Meghan McCain did what she apparently does best: Make the conversation about herself and, in this case, her personal beef with a presidential hopeful.After applauding Booker for saying Medicare for All is unrealistic, the conservative View co-host took issue with the New Jersey senator’s support for mandatory gun buybacks. This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he’s going to take her brother’s guns.After a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they’d continue the conversation in the next segment.“No we’re not,” McCain grumbled. “It’s fine.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

How did we get there?”After noting that he lives near one of the fires in the Los Angeles area, Rubin immediately took aim at liberal politics as the main reason the wildfires have grown so large and dangerous.“The problem right now is that everything, EVERYTHING, from academia to public utilities to politics, everything that goes woke, that buys into this ridiculous progressive ideology that cares about what contractors are LGBT or how many black firemen we have or white this or Asian that, everything that goes that road eventually breaks down,” he declared.As Carlson nodded and said “that’s true,” Rubin continued, complaining that this isn’t how “freedom is supposed to operate.”“What is supposed to happen—imagine if your house was on fire,” he added. “Would you care what the public utility or what the fire company, what contractor they brought in, what gender or sexuality or any of those things he or she was? It’s just absolutely ridiculous.”The Fox News host continued to agree with Rubin, who went on to tie PG&E;’s preemptive blackouts to a lack of “libertarian or conservative-minded people in California to fight what the progressives are doing to the state.”“If you can’t keep the lights on and you can’t keep the place from burning down, you’ve reached the point where there is no kind of lying about it anymore,” Carlson concluded. “It’s falling apart.

A staffer sitting behind her was captured on video as her eyes widened in shock.""You have demonstrated that you will pursue this heinous white supremacist ideology at all costs,"" said Wasserman Schultz.

The Democrats&#39; impeachment process has a credibility problem,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 10:02:29 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/democrats-impeachment-process-credibility-problem-140229011.html,"Has the House impeachment inquiry hit a brick wall on credibility? Or have House Democrats decided to call Republicans' bluff?After weeks of refusing to hold a full floor vote to formally launch an impeachment inquiry, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) abruptly changed position this week. A Thursday vote will set out more clear parameters for the ongoing investigation without explicitly declaring an impeachment inquiry, but it's far from clear whether this changes anything appreciably -- or if there's anything to change with the current focus on Ukraine policy as the predicate for impeachment.The bill that emerged Tuesday afternoon appears to directly address some of the key criticisms of House Republicans, who grew so frustrated with the closed hearings that they staged an intervention of sorts last week, breaching the Secure Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) in which the depositions were being taken under the control of House Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff. That set off worries among Democrats that further such demonstrations could obstruct and drag out the impeachment process into next year and into the election cycle, something Pelosi would like to avoid.Democrats' claims that the demonstrations were a GOP stunt had some basis in fact. Some of the Republicans who participated actually did have access to the hearings as members of three committees participating in the testimony. Contrary to some claims made at the time, Republican committee members had the opportunity to ask questions of the witnesses during the deposition and were very engaged in that process.Still, other Republican complaints had started to take their toll. Republicans wanted Democrats to hold a full House vote to openly authorize an impeachment inquiry, rather than use committees to conduct an ad hoc investigation while House Democratic leadership publicly acknowledged that impeachment was the goal. They also wanted open hearings with the witnesses being subpoenaed, which Democrats refused to grant in order to keep witnesses from knowing preceding testimony. Democrats pointed out that the House rules allowed for closed-session depositions and compared them to secret grand-jury proceedings, but Republicans countered that grand juries don't leak characterizations of the testimony at pressers, as Schiff and other Democrats had been doing all along.That has made the proceedings seem as though they're being conducted by a kangaroo court, which has allowed Trump to argue that the process is corrupt. The only way to gain traction for this process is to give it more credibility -- and to call the bluff of Republicans and Trump. Thus, Pelosi introduced a bill that will allow Republicans to call their own witnesses and to access all deposition materials, under the same rules used in the Bill Clinton impeachment process in 1998. The bill also establishes a mechanism for the full release of testimony, which Republicans have repeatedly demanded.This presents an immediate tactical risk for the White House. One of Pelosi's motives is to parry Trump's refusal to cooperate based on a lack of formal approval by the full House. A federal court ruled against Trump last week, but Trump can tie that question up for months on appeals, time that Pelosi perceives she does not have. A full House vote approving these rules not only means that Republicans no longer have due-process complaints (at least going forward), it signals to courts that the full House has indeed given tacit approval for an impeachment inquiry in providing a relatively fair structure for it.However, Pelosi is more worried about a different court: the court of public opinion. That perception that the impeachment process is unfair has hampered Democrats' ability to generate the kind of public support they need to take this to a full vote on impeachment without risking the gains Pelosi made in the 2018 midterms. National polling showing support for impeachment gaining momentum overall, but the response from the American public looks quite different on a state-by-state basis. A poll by The New York Times and Siena College last week showed that voters in six critical swing states with the closest margins in 2016 generally oppose impeachment, 43/53. Those numbers would suggest that continuing on this impeachment process might produce a Pyrrhic victory for Democrats in 2020, one that could produce a historic win for an already-impeached president for the first time ever.To fix that problem, and to force the Senate to take this more seriously, Pelosi has to revamp the process to provide at least the appearance of fairness. However, it's not likely to matter in the end. Impeachment is only the first step in the removal process, and in this case it's likely to be the last step Democrats can successfully take.The Republicans control the Senate, but their majority matters less than the fact that Democrats don't have a supermajority. If Democrats had uncovered a truly serious crime in this probe, that would likely convince at least 20 Senate Republicans to make Mike Pence president. The core problem is that Ukraine-Gate doesn't appear to involve an explicit statutory crime at all, but instead an alleged abuse of authority to gain political advantage over former Vice President Joe Biden. The House can decide what constitutes an impeachable offense, but the Senate decides whether it's even worthy of a full trial, let alone a removal.An impeachment without a removal will, in the end, look a lot like a political campaign no matter how much Pelosi improves the process. Voters will ask themselves why Democrats spent all year obsessed with impeachment under varying rationalizations and then chose the one issue on which they could almost guarantee no success in removal. Pelosi may win a tactical victory with this upcoming vote, but it's not going to solve the big strategic issue awaiting Democrats at the end of this process.Want more essential commentary and analysis like this delivered straight to your inbox?

"Former &lt;/&gt;Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:11:25 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/former-time-editor-wants-hate-211125098.html,"A former Time editor claimed that the United States needs a law banning hate speech, and that President Donald Trump “might be in violation of it” if there were one -- because, apparently, he doesn’t notice the irony of holding both of these views at once.In a Tuesday tweet promoting his Washington Post piece, titled “Why America needs a hate speech law,” Richard Stengel stated:> My @WashingtonPost piece on why the very broadness of the First Amendment suggests we should have a hate speech law. And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f> > -- Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019In the piece, Stengel writes that “many nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred” in the wake of World War II:> These laws started out as protections against the kinds of anti-Semitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws, but there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general, hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.“I’m all for protecting ‘thought that we hate,’ but not speech that incites hate,” he continues. “It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.”It’s interesting how Stengel actually does acknowledge the fact that “there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is,” and yet he still wants laws banning it. This makes absolutely no sense. After all, when he calls for laws to ban “hate speech,” he is, inherently, giving the government the power to decide what would and would not qualify -- the exact same government that is led by Donald Trump, and that is full of people who support him.In other words: Stengel somehow trusts that the government will have the same view of “hate speech” as he does, and then, in the same thought, seems to acknowledge that there’s actually no way that many of them would. Unless he thinks that the president and his congressional supporters would actually pass a law that they’d be in violation of, his argument for “hate speech” laws winds up being a pretty great argument against them.It’s ironic, but it’s not new: More often than not, it’s the uber-progressives arguing for laws against “hate speech” -- despite the fact that they’re often the same people who are also arguing that Donald Trump and Republicans are constantly spewing it. Maybe it’s just me, but if I thought that the leader of my government was, you know, literally Hitler or whatever, the last thing that I’d want would be to give that person and their supporters control over my speech.Yes, the First Amendment gives us the right to be “offensive” with our speech. Given the fact that a new thing seems to be declared “racist” or “sexist” every day, I’m certainly glad that we do have this protection. After all, it would only take there being a few too many of the “super woke” in our government for a phrase like “you guys” to become a criminal offense.The truth is, though, the right to be “offensive” (however you define that subjective term, anyway) is not even the most important role that our First Amendment plays. No, what’s most important is that it protects our right to speak out against the government when we see fit -- without having to worry about its retaliation. Like it or not, the only way to ensure that we retain this important check on government power is to never (ever) give its leaders a vehicle take it away.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eTNessteMBpuBTcqmJGuYw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/bae9af12e23cce197b317b5c1be56053,"Former </>Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony"

"More than 1,000 homeless people died in Los Angeles county last year","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 16:20:14 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/homeless-deaths-la-county-double-202014816.html,"The county’s public health department has reported 1,047 deaths for last year, a number that has increased steadily since 2013A woman pushes a cart full of her belongings past tents near Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles. Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty ImagesMore than 1,000 homeless people died in Los Angeles county in 2018, double the number of deaths from six years ago. The increase is a stark illustration of the region’s severe housing crisis, advocates said.The LA county public health department reported this week that 1,047 homeless people died last year, a number that has steadily increased every year since 2013, when 536 people died. The leading causes of death were coronary heart disease, which accounted for 22% of deaths, followed by alcohol and drug overdose at 21%, transportation-related injuries at 9%, homicides at 6% and suicides at 5%.The data sheds light on a worsening public health emergency in the county, where officials estimate there are now 59,000 people homeless, including more than 44,000 people who are living unsheltered – in cars, tents, or makeshift quarters. The report also follows a string of high-profile attacks against homeless people in the area, including the killing of Darrell Fields, a beloved musician who was burned to death in his tent on Skid Row.“We’ve got three people a day dying on the streets,” said Adam Rice, an organizer with Los Angeles Community Action Network (LA Can), a group that had worked closely with Fields. “It is a complete failure of leadership. Darrell didn’t need to die. None of these people needed to die. The reason this is happening is because there’s not proper housing.”Darrell Fields, 62, was a homeless man in Los Angeles known as Mr Guitar. He was killed in August when his tent was set ablaze. Photograph: Los Angeles Community Action NetworkSoaring rents and a major shortage of affordable housing have pushed people out of their homes in the area, with more than half of unsheltered adults in a recent count saying they were experiencing homelessness for the first time. The county estimated that there are now 8,800 homeless families.“It brings an overwhelming sadness when you think about precious human beings dying in our streets when it can be avoided,” said the Rev Andy Bales, CEO of Union Rescue Mission (URM), which runs a shelter at Skid Row, at the epicenter of the crisis in downtown LA.The county’s analysis also found that the mortality rate among homeless people has also jumped: “Put simply, being homeless in LA county is becoming increasingly deadly,” the agency wrote.The increase in overdoses represented the largest jump in terms of causes of death, the report found. In addition, the mortality rate among white homeless people has decreased while the rate of deaths for black and Latino residents has increased, the county said. Overall, African Americans are four times more likely to experience homelessness in LA county than other groups.Of the transportation-related deaths, which include vehicle and train collisions, 82% of victims were pedestrians and cyclists.The county and local clinics have increasingly sent healthcare workers to encampments to try to serve people on the streets. More than 21,000 homeless people were also placed in housing last year, an increase from 2017, officials reported early this year.The health department report this week recommended more direct outreach to homeless people, the creation of a “death review team” to study the subject and more traffic safety measures near encampments.Bales predicted that medical visits were not enough to reverse the deadly trends: “What we need most is for everyone to be immediately under a roof and protected from the elements. Until that happens, the death rates will continue to grow … and more and more people will be devastated by homelessness.”The crisis demanded a more urgent response, he added: “How much evidence do we need to gather before we decide not to let another human being die on the street?”LA’s homeless crisis has recently received national attention, with the Trump administration suggesting it could pursue some kind of law enforcement crackdown, drawing skepticism from some local organizations. Advocates have criticized efforts to further criminalize people living on the streets and have argued that the government needs to put more funding to housing and shelter.“It’s really a travesty when you think about it. How many deaths could’ve been prevented?” said Kourtney Milligan, a 29-year-old homeless woman, who has lived on Skid Row. “The resources that they say are out there are so hard to find.”",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/s2XrfBGfKBrVbz9mGlm7bg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/f15aa3ae803200f5d01035f9967bdb02,"More than 1,000 homeless people died in Los Angeles county last year"
South Africans Face Tax Increases as Revenue Collection Lags,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 08:05:09 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/south-africans-face-tax-increases-120509942.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Explore what’s moving the global economy in the new season of the Stephanomics podcast. Subscribe via Pocket Cast or iTunes.South Africans have to brace for higher taxes next year as revenue collection falls short of estimates.Bailouts for the state-owned power utility, broadcaster, airlines and arms maker – together with a failure to curb the public-sector wage bill and stem fiscal leakages – have sapped the state’s resources. Africa’s most-industrialized economy hasn’t expanded by more than 2% annually since 2013, damping confidence and resulting in the longest business-cycle downturn since 1945, weighing on tax income.The National Treasury increased the value-added tax rate last year for the time in more than two decades and has also raised taxes for high-income earners to plug the widening budget deficit. That has added to the strain on consumption spending and economic growth.“Significant tax increases over the past several years leave only moderate scope to boost tax revenue at this time,” the Treasury said in its medium-term budget policy statement released Wednesday in Cape Town. Additional tax measures are under consideration to raise an extra 10 billion rand ($683 million) in fiscal 2021, it said, without giving details.“Given the fiscal position we find ourselves in, all tax options need to be on the table,” said Chris Axelson, chief director for economic tax analysis in the Treasury.The South African Revenue Service will probably collect 1.37 trillion rand in the 2020 fiscal year, 52.5 billion rand less than forecast in February, the Treasury said. The shortfall will be 84 billion rand in 2021 and 114.7 billion rand in 2022, it said.The shortfall reflects “job losses, lower wage settlements and smaller bonuses reducing personal income-tax collection,” the Treasury said. Reduced profitability in a difficult trading environment meant lower-than-expected corporate income-tax collections, while weak household consumption moderated the increase in revenue from value-added tax, it said.The February budget included 7 billion rand from the sale of non-core assets by March, but “there is a risk these sales will not be completed by the end of the financial year,” the Treasury said.The government insists that citizens of Gauteng – which houses the financial hub of Johannesburg and the capital, Pretoria – must pay for electronically administered tolls to use the province’s roads, and will strengthen compliance measures.In July, Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula said South Africa is considering the options available on scrapping the tolls.“Not paying your tolls has already led to our roads deteriorating,” Finance Minister Tito Mboweni said in a prepared copy if his speech. “We have been unable to maintain the network. I urge the nation to please pay your bills.”\--With assistance from Zoe Schneeweiss.To contact the reporter on this story: Ana Monteiro in Johannesburg at amonteiro4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Rene Vollgraaff at rvollgraaff@bloomberg.net, Robert BrandFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uvN2DnzYlF.TzezBAQo5Gg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/8a4780226c720322234fa6fbc613c5e6,South Africans Face Tax Increases as Revenue Collection Lags

"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:17:36 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/record-wave-lone-child-migrants-122133758.html,"TENOSIQUE, Mexico -- The United States has detained more children trying to cross the nation's southwest border on their own over the last year than during any other period on record, surpassing the surge of unaccompanied minors that set off a crisis during the Obama administration, according to new figures released Tuesday.U.S. immigration authorities apprehended 76,020 minors, most of them from Central America, traveling without their parents in the fiscal year that ended in September -- 52% more than during the last fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Mexico is experiencing the same surge. Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period -- pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.In interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous -- and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.""These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,"" Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters. ""And each month during the fiscal year, the numbers increased. You saw them. We all saw them.""The young migrants came alongside a historic wave of families traveling together, also largely from Central America. They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.Marvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced -- and he pressed on.""Quitting was not an option,"" Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. ""You wipe your tears and carry on.""For the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they'd kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.His parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said. ""We can't bear losing another son,"" they told him. ""You have to go.""He left home in the spring, with $40 in his pocket and no plan except to find work in a safer place.As for most underage migrants traveling without their parents, his trip north has been a feat of improvisation and courage. He walked and hitchhiked through Honduras and Guatemala. He slept in churches, under trees or wherever he found himself when night fell.Along the way, he gathered crucial bits of information from fellow migrants: the best route to take, locations of shelters up ahead, places to avoid, where to forage for food.As huge numbers of young migrants from Central America began arriving at the United States' southern border in 2014, the Obama administration scrambled to house them until they could be released to sponsors -- adults who applied to care for them. The shelter system grew dramatically as a result.The Trump administration experienced similar backups at the border just a few years later -- this time because of new, more stringent policies that made the sponsors themselves, who are often undocumented, vulnerable to immigration authorities. This discouraged people from coming forward, leaving thousands of children to languish in the system.The Trump administration has also sought to deter migration by separating thousands of children from their relatives, again driving up the number of children in federally contracted shelters.On the road, while trying to avoid detention, fear and hunger are constant companions for many young migrants.With little or no money in their pockets, they relied on strangers for snacks or meals. They pawed through garbage and scanned drifts of debris on the roadside, hoping to spot an edible morsel.Wilson, a 17-year-old Honduran, said he had feasted on rotten mangos discarded by street vendors.""I used to drink water from potholes when I was too thirsty,"" interjected Mario Leonel, 16, who left home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, several weeks ago without notifying his parents. ""That is the hardest part of it all: the hunger.""When he arrived at the shelter in Tenosique, a small Mexican town near the Guatemala border, he called his parents in Honduras, who burst into tears and pleaded for him to return. He said no. He was tired of all the violence in his country, and wanted to get asylum in the United States.After Marvel slipped across the Guatemala-Mexico border in May, he found room at a shelter in Tenosique, which serves as a transit point for many migrants. He quickly made new friends among other teenage migrants who had made it this far, mainly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador.On a recent afternoon, several of them gathered in a two-story building that had been reserved for minors, its walls painted with colorful animal murals. The boys cracked jokes, roughhoused and argued about who was the cutest girl in the shelter.Outside, Dulce, a 16-year-old transgender migrant from Guatemala, sat alone on train tracks pining for a boy she had met at the shelter. He had left without explanation and she was lovesick.""I just can't get him out of my mind,"" she said.She left her hometown four months earlier to escape abuse from her family and strangers, including a sexual assault by gang members when she was 12. She made it as far as central Mexico before being detained and deported. Five days after returning home, she set off again.""I left because I had nothing there and no one to protect me,"" she said. ""At least here I am safe.""Though the United States remains the destination of choice for most unaccompanied minors, an increasing number are setting their sights no farther than Mexico, advocates and migrants say.Sometimes they have no choice: Mexico's increased enforcement measures have made it more difficult for migrants to make it to the border with the United States. And even if they reach the United States, recent policies have drastically lowered the possibilities of getting asylum.In Mexico, when unaccompanied minors are detained, the law mandates that they be released right away into the custody of the national child protection agency, which finds them accommodation in shelters designed for children.But migrants' advocates say the government has been holding children in the nation's overcrowded detention centers for far too long, and that some children are quickly funneled into the deportation process rather than being given a fair chance to seek asylum or some other form of relief.""No child should ever be held at a detention center,"" said Elba Coria, a migration expert from the Clinic for Refugees at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City. ""But while international standards consider children's detention as an exceptional measure, amid Mexico's migration chaos, it is the rule.""Neither Marvel nor any of his new friends in the Tenosique shelter had been detained by the authorities. All had managed to cross into Mexico from Guatemala and had applied for asylum in Mexico after talking through their options with the shelter staff.They now plan to remain in Mexico and look for work and study opportunities -- even if they haven't abandoned hope of making it to the United States.""It is every Honduran's boy dream to get to the United States, where there is more money and kids are able to go to school,"" said Jose Angel, 17. He was born with a disability that left him unable to use his arms and left his hometown because his grandmother could no longer take care of him.He was hopeful he could apply for asylum in the United States despite Trump's many efforts to severely lower the number of people granted asylum. ""It is scary, but you have to take a chance,"" he said.On a recent morning, Alan, a 17-year-old Guatemalan migrant, sat on the sidewalk outside a migrant shelter in the city of Palenque, in southern Mexico. He had just crossed the border and was exhausted. Mexican immigration officials had stopped a bus he was on, but he managed to escape into the countryside and hide.Alan planned to take a nap, shower and have a meal before trying illegally to board a freight train known as The Beast. It runs from Mexico's border with Guatemala to its border with the United States and, for decades, migrants have clung to it to speed through much of Mexico.His hope was to make it to the U.S. border and petition for asylum. He was undeterred by Trump's recent efforts to restrict asylum claims or curb immigration.""One way or another, I have to make it to the other side where there are skyscrapers and life is better,"" he said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5ol82jExNHqBHa7IGzz2mw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/03f35d3f9d537a8dc9fe503d06c098de,"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation"
Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 10:05:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-warren-untenable-plans-140521979.html,"If you’ve been having trouble finding someone to walk your dog, don’t worry. Any day now, Elizabeth Warren will announce “a plan for that.” It will undoubtedly be comprehensive, detailed, and replete with subsidies for lower- and middle-class dog walkers and underserved breeds. It will cost tens of billions of dollars and will receive widespread positive notice from the media. However, to judge by her other recent plans, the one thing it won’t include is any discussion of how she plans to pay for it.The Massachusetts senator has challenged and possibly overtaken former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, largely based on having a plan for the government to tackle every problem facing this country, no matter how big or how small, from issues with military housing to Puerto Rican debt to climate change.The price tag for this massive expansion of government is enormous. Much of the attention in recent weeks has been focused on Warren’s embrace of Medicare for All, which she refuses to admit would require an increase in middle-class taxes. Even Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has conceded that such proposals, which would cost $30–40 trillion over 10 years, cannot be financed without tax hikes. Warren’s refusal to address this obvious fact makes her look less like a would-be policy wonk and more like a typical politician.But even setting aside Medicare for All, Warren’s plans are likely to dump oceans of red ink onto our growing national debt. Her non-health-care spending proposals already total some $7.5 trillion per year over the next 10 years. Although these are not quite Bernie levels of government largesse, her proposals would still require nearly double our current levels of spending.To pay for all this, Warren proposes a variety of tax hikes, mostly designed to hit corporations or high-earners: higher payroll taxes for those earning more than $250,000 per year; a 7 percent profits tax on companies earning more than $100 million; a 60 percent lobbying tax on firms that spend a million or more on lobbying, and so forth. But the biggest chunk of money would come from Warren’s proposed “wealth tax,” a 2 to 3 percent levy on net worth above $50 million. Warren estimates that this wealth tax will pull in more than $2.75 trillion over ten years. It won’t.First, there is the slight problem that a wealth tax is probably unconstitutional. Of course, constitutional constraints are quaint notions in the Age of Trump. Regardless, it is worth noting that the Constitution permits the federal government to impose only “direct taxes,” such as a property tax. That’s why it required a constitutional amendment to enact the federal income tax. Many constitutional scholars warn that a wealth tax is neither a direct tax nor income tax.Even if Warren can find a way around the constitutional guardrails -- perhaps by something such as a retrospective wealth tax in which you wait until a taxpayer sells assets or passes away -- a wealth tax is unlikely to raise anywhere near the amount of money she predicts.Simply look at Europe’s experiments with wealth taxes. At one time, a dozen European countries imposed wealth taxes. Today, all but three have abandoned those levies. Among those repealing their wealth tax are the Scandinavian social democracies that Warren admires, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Norway retains a wealth tax but has significantly reduced it in recent years. Additional countries abandoning the tax include Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Other countries, such as Great Britain, have considered wealth taxes and rejected them.They did so because wealth taxes are administratively complex and difficult to enforce. Also, they significantly reduce investment, entrepreneurship, and, ultimately, economic growth. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, European wealth taxes raised, on average, only about 0.2 percent of GDP in revenues. By comparison, the U.S. federal income tax raises 8 percent of GDP.Two groups, however, would benefit substantially from a wealth tax. The tax would be a full-employment opportunity for the tax-preparation industry and for lawyers. After all, we would now have to determine fair market value for everything from homes and vehicles to artwork and jewelry to family pension rights and intellectual property. The other big winner would be lobbyists, who could be expected to descend on Washington en masse seeking exemptions and exceptions for their clients. If you think the tax code is a mess today, just wait until D.C. is done with Warren’s plan.There is an old Yiddish proverb that goes “Mann tracht, un Gott Lacht,” or “Man plans, and God laughs.” It is all well and good that Senator Warren has a plan for everything. But until she actually figures out how to pay for everything without crippling our economy, such plans really don’t add up.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/t_XOfhQ2Q8pn0Eihbaza4g--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/710b4188b8e44ebd02c332c03dfb8d66,Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans
Meghan McCain Spars With Cory Booker Over Civility: Beto Was ‘Very Nasty’ to Me!,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:39:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/meghan-mccain-spars-cory-booker-163901660.html,"During a Wednesday interview with Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, The View’s Meghan McCain did what she apparently does best: Make the conversation about herself and, in this case, her personal beef with a presidential hopeful.After applauding Booker for saying Medicare for All is unrealistic, the conservative View co-host took issue with the New Jersey senator’s support for mandatory gun buybacks. This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he’s going to take her brother’s guns.After a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they’d continue the conversation in the next segment.“No we’re not,” McCain grumbled. “It’s fine.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Circuit for the U.S. Court of Appeals on Tuesday night halted the scheduled release of grand-jury materials from Robert Mueller’s investigation, just hours ahead of the scheduled distribution.The decision came after a federal judge ruled last Friday that the Justice Department must release unredacted material from the original Mueller investigation, a move House Democrats have clamored for in the midst of the ongoing impeachment inquiry.Judge Beryl Howell, an Obama appointee, wrote that the committee “has shown that it needs the grand jury material referenced and cited in the Mueller Report to avoid a possible injustice in the impeachment inquiry.”The DOJ contested Howell’s ruling and issued an emergency appeal, saying a quick release “threatens an irreparable loss of grand-jury secrecy before this court even has a chance to act on the Department’s stay motion.” The government also noted that Howell gave no explanation for her seemingly arbitrary deadline of Wednesday, which was not offered by Democrats.The three-judge D.C. panel — made up of judges appointed by Barack Obama — decided on an administrative stay in order “to give the court sufficient opportunity to consider the emergency motion for stay pending appeal and should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits of that motion,” according to the decision.The debate centers around the validity of redactions to a grand-jury deposition, which is usually kept secret. The DOJ argues that materials in the report are squarely protected by federal evidence regulations, while others point to ongoing criminal matters involved, including a probe by Connecticut U.S attorney John Durham the origins of the investigation.

"Former &lt;/&gt;Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:11:25 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/former-time-editor-wants-hate-211125098.html,"A former Time editor claimed that the United States needs a law banning hate speech, and that President Donald Trump “might be in violation of it” if there were one -- because, apparently, he doesn’t notice the irony of holding both of these views at once.In a Tuesday tweet promoting his Washington Post piece, titled “Why America needs a hate speech law,” Richard Stengel stated:> My @WashingtonPost piece on why the very broadness of the First Amendment suggests we should have a hate speech law. And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f> > -- Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019In the piece, Stengel writes that “many nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred” in the wake of World War II:> These laws started out as protections against the kinds of anti-Semitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws, but there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general, hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.“I’m all for protecting ‘thought that we hate,’ but not speech that incites hate,” he continues. “It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.”It’s interesting how Stengel actually does acknowledge the fact that “there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is,” and yet he still wants laws banning it. This makes absolutely no sense. After all, when he calls for laws to ban “hate speech,” he is, inherently, giving the government the power to decide what would and would not qualify -- the exact same government that is led by Donald Trump, and that is full of people who support him.In other words: Stengel somehow trusts that the government will have the same view of “hate speech” as he does, and then, in the same thought, seems to acknowledge that there’s actually no way that many of them would. Unless he thinks that the president and his congressional supporters would actually pass a law that they’d be in violation of, his argument for “hate speech” laws winds up being a pretty great argument against them.It’s ironic, but it’s not new: More often than not, it’s the uber-progressives arguing for laws against “hate speech” -- despite the fact that they’re often the same people who are also arguing that Donald Trump and Republicans are constantly spewing it. Maybe it’s just me, but if I thought that the leader of my government was, you know, literally Hitler or whatever, the last thing that I’d want would be to give that person and their supporters control over my speech.Yes, the First Amendment gives us the right to be “offensive” with our speech. Given the fact that a new thing seems to be declared “racist” or “sexist” every day, I’m certainly glad that we do have this protection. After all, it would only take there being a few too many of the “super woke” in our government for a phrase like “you guys” to become a criminal offense.The truth is, though, the right to be “offensive” (however you define that subjective term, anyway) is not even the most important role that our First Amendment plays. No, what’s most important is that it protects our right to speak out against the government when we see fit -- without having to worry about its retaliation. Like it or not, the only way to ensure that we retain this important check on government power is to never (ever) give its leaders a vehicle take it away.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eTNessteMBpuBTcqmJGuYw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/bae9af12e23cce197b317b5c1be56053,"Former </>Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony"

"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:17:36 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/record-wave-lone-child-migrants-122133758.html,"TENOSIQUE, Mexico -- The United States has detained more children trying to cross the nation's southwest border on their own over the last year than during any other period on record, surpassing the surge of unaccompanied minors that set off a crisis during the Obama administration, according to new figures released Tuesday.U.S. immigration authorities apprehended 76,020 minors, most of them from Central America, traveling without their parents in the fiscal year that ended in September -- 52% more than during the last fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Mexico is experiencing the same surge. Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period -- pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.In interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous -- and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.""These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,"" Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters. ""And each month during the fiscal year, the numbers increased. You saw them. We all saw them.""The young migrants came alongside a historic wave of families traveling together, also largely from Central America. They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.Marvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced -- and he pressed on.""Quitting was not an option,"" Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. ""You wipe your tears and carry on.""For the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they'd kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.His parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said. ""We can't bear losing another son,"" they told him. ""You have to go.""He left home in the spring, with $40 in his pocket and no plan except to find work in a safer place.As for most underage migrants traveling without their parents, his trip north has been a feat of improvisation and courage. He walked and hitchhiked through Honduras and Guatemala. He slept in churches, under trees or wherever he found himself when night fell.Along the way, he gathered crucial bits of information from fellow migrants: the best route to take, locations of shelters up ahead, places to avoid, where to forage for food.As huge numbers of young migrants from Central America began arriving at the United States' southern border in 2014, the Obama administration scrambled to house them until they could be released to sponsors -- adults who applied to care for them. The shelter system grew dramatically as a result.The Trump administration experienced similar backups at the border just a few years later -- this time because of new, more stringent policies that made the sponsors themselves, who are often undocumented, vulnerable to immigration authorities. This discouraged people from coming forward, leaving thousands of children to languish in the system.The Trump administration has also sought to deter migration by separating thousands of children from their relatives, again driving up the number of children in federally contracted shelters.On the road, while trying to avoid detention, fear and hunger are constant companions for many young migrants.With little or no money in their pockets, they relied on strangers for snacks or meals. They pawed through garbage and scanned drifts of debris on the roadside, hoping to spot an edible morsel.Wilson, a 17-year-old Honduran, said he had feasted on rotten mangos discarded by street vendors.""I used to drink water from potholes when I was too thirsty,"" interjected Mario Leonel, 16, who left home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, several weeks ago without notifying his parents. ""That is the hardest part of it all: the hunger.""When he arrived at the shelter in Tenosique, a small Mexican town near the Guatemala border, he called his parents in Honduras, who burst into tears and pleaded for him to return. He said no. He was tired of all the violence in his country, and wanted to get asylum in the United States.After Marvel slipped across the Guatemala-Mexico border in May, he found room at a shelter in Tenosique, which serves as a transit point for many migrants. He quickly made new friends among other teenage migrants who had made it this far, mainly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador.On a recent afternoon, several of them gathered in a two-story building that had been reserved for minors, its walls painted with colorful animal murals. The boys cracked jokes, roughhoused and argued about who was the cutest girl in the shelter.Outside, Dulce, a 16-year-old transgender migrant from Guatemala, sat alone on train tracks pining for a boy she had met at the shelter. He had left without explanation and she was lovesick.""I just can't get him out of my mind,"" she said.She left her hometown four months earlier to escape abuse from her family and strangers, including a sexual assault by gang members when she was 12. She made it as far as central Mexico before being detained and deported. Five days after returning home, she set off again.""I left because I had nothing there and no one to protect me,"" she said. ""At least here I am safe.""Though the United States remains the destination of choice for most unaccompanied minors, an increasing number are setting their sights no farther than Mexico, advocates and migrants say.Sometimes they have no choice: Mexico's increased enforcement measures have made it more difficult for migrants to make it to the border with the United States. And even if they reach the United States, recent policies have drastically lowered the possibilities of getting asylum.In Mexico, when unaccompanied minors are detained, the law mandates that they be released right away into the custody of the national child protection agency, which finds them accommodation in shelters designed for children.But migrants' advocates say the government has been holding children in the nation's overcrowded detention centers for far too long, and that some children are quickly funneled into the deportation process rather than being given a fair chance to seek asylum or some other form of relief.""No child should ever be held at a detention center,"" said Elba Coria, a migration expert from the Clinic for Refugees at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City. ""But while international standards consider children's detention as an exceptional measure, amid Mexico's migration chaos, it is the rule.""Neither Marvel nor any of his new friends in the Tenosique shelter had been detained by the authorities. All had managed to cross into Mexico from Guatemala and had applied for asylum in Mexico after talking through their options with the shelter staff.They now plan to remain in Mexico and look for work and study opportunities -- even if they haven't abandoned hope of making it to the United States.""It is every Honduran's boy dream to get to the United States, where there is more money and kids are able to go to school,"" said Jose Angel, 17. He was born with a disability that left him unable to use his arms and left his hometown because his grandmother could no longer take care of him.He was hopeful he could apply for asylum in the United States despite Trump's many efforts to severely lower the number of people granted asylum. ""It is scary, but you have to take a chance,"" he said.On a recent morning, Alan, a 17-year-old Guatemalan migrant, sat on the sidewalk outside a migrant shelter in the city of Palenque, in southern Mexico. He had just crossed the border and was exhausted. Mexican immigration officials had stopped a bus he was on, but he managed to escape into the countryside and hide.Alan planned to take a nap, shower and have a meal before trying illegally to board a freight train known as The Beast. It runs from Mexico's border with Guatemala to its border with the United States and, for decades, migrants have clung to it to speed through much of Mexico.His hope was to make it to the U.S. border and petition for asylum. He was undeterred by Trump's recent efforts to restrict asylum claims or curb immigration.""One way or another, I have to make it to the other side where there are skyscrapers and life is better,"" he said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5ol82jExNHqBHa7IGzz2mw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/03f35d3f9d537a8dc9fe503d06c098de,"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation"
Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 10:05:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-warren-untenable-plans-140521979.html,"If you’ve been having trouble finding someone to walk your dog, don’t worry. Any day now, Elizabeth Warren will announce “a plan for that.” It will undoubtedly be comprehensive, detailed, and replete with subsidies for lower- and middle-class dog walkers and underserved breeds. It will cost tens of billions of dollars and will receive widespread positive notice from the media. However, to judge by her other recent plans, the one thing it won’t include is any discussion of how she plans to pay for it.The Massachusetts senator has challenged and possibly overtaken former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, largely based on having a plan for the government to tackle every problem facing this country, no matter how big or how small, from issues with military housing to Puerto Rican debt to climate change.The price tag for this massive expansion of government is enormous. Much of the attention in recent weeks has been focused on Warren’s embrace of Medicare for All, which she refuses to admit would require an increase in middle-class taxes. Even Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has conceded that such proposals, which would cost $30–40 trillion over 10 years, cannot be financed without tax hikes. Warren’s refusal to address this obvious fact makes her look less like a would-be policy wonk and more like a typical politician.But even setting aside Medicare for All, Warren’s plans are likely to dump oceans of red ink onto our growing national debt. Her non-health-care spending proposals already total some $7.5 trillion per year over the next 10 years. Although these are not quite Bernie levels of government largesse, her proposals would still require nearly double our current levels of spending.To pay for all this, Warren proposes a variety of tax hikes, mostly designed to hit corporations or high-earners: higher payroll taxes for those earning more than $250,000 per year; a 7 percent profits tax on companies earning more than $100 million; a 60 percent lobbying tax on firms that spend a million or more on lobbying, and so forth. But the biggest chunk of money would come from Warren’s proposed “wealth tax,” a 2 to 3 percent levy on net worth above $50 million. Warren estimates that this wealth tax will pull in more than $2.75 trillion over ten years. It won’t.First, there is the slight problem that a wealth tax is probably unconstitutional. Of course, constitutional constraints are quaint notions in the Age of Trump. Regardless, it is worth noting that the Constitution permits the federal government to impose only “direct taxes,” such as a property tax. That’s why it required a constitutional amendment to enact the federal income tax. Many constitutional scholars warn that a wealth tax is neither a direct tax nor income tax.Even if Warren can find a way around the constitutional guardrails -- perhaps by something such as a retrospective wealth tax in which you wait until a taxpayer sells assets or passes away -- a wealth tax is unlikely to raise anywhere near the amount of money she predicts.Simply look at Europe’s experiments with wealth taxes. At one time, a dozen European countries imposed wealth taxes. Today, all but three have abandoned those levies. Among those repealing their wealth tax are the Scandinavian social democracies that Warren admires, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Norway retains a wealth tax but has significantly reduced it in recent years. Additional countries abandoning the tax include Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Other countries, such as Great Britain, have considered wealth taxes and rejected them.They did so because wealth taxes are administratively complex and difficult to enforce. Also, they significantly reduce investment, entrepreneurship, and, ultimately, economic growth. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, European wealth taxes raised, on average, only about 0.2 percent of GDP in revenues. By comparison, the U.S. federal income tax raises 8 percent of GDP.Two groups, however, would benefit substantially from a wealth tax. The tax would be a full-employment opportunity for the tax-preparation industry and for lawyers. After all, we would now have to determine fair market value for everything from homes and vehicles to artwork and jewelry to family pension rights and intellectual property. The other big winner would be lobbyists, who could be expected to descend on Washington en masse seeking exemptions and exceptions for their clients. If you think the tax code is a mess today, just wait until D.C. is done with Warren’s plan.There is an old Yiddish proverb that goes “Mann tracht, un Gott Lacht,” or “Man plans, and God laughs.” It is all well and good that Senator Warren has a plan for everything. But until she actually figures out how to pay for everything without crippling our economy, such plans really don’t add up.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/t_XOfhQ2Q8pn0Eihbaza4g--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/710b4188b8e44ebd02c332c03dfb8d66,Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans
Meghan McCain Spars With Cory Booker Over Civility: Beto Was ‘Very Nasty’ to Me!,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:39:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/meghan-mccain-spars-cory-booker-163901660.html,"During a Wednesday interview with Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, The View’s Meghan McCain did what she apparently does best: Make the conversation about herself and, in this case, her personal beef with a presidential hopeful.After applauding Booker for saying Medicare for All is unrealistic, the conservative View co-host took issue with the New Jersey senator’s support for mandatory gun buybacks. This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he’s going to take her brother’s guns.After a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they’d continue the conversation in the next segment.“No we’re not,” McCain grumbled. “It’s fine.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Tucker Carlson and Guest Blame Diversity and ‘Woke’ Culture for California Fires,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 07:17:19 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/tucker-carlson-guest-blame-diversity-032855316.html,"Fox NewsFox News host Tucker Carlson and his guest, conservative YouTube personality Dave Rubin, both insisted Tuesday night that the wildfires burning across California are due largely to progressive ideology, “woke” culture, and diversity in hiring.During Tuesday’s broadcast of Tucker Carlson Tonight, Carlson welcomed on Rubin, a political commentator and podcaster, to discuss the issues surrounding the large fires engulfing the state, including those related to the electrical grid and firefighting methods.“PG&E; strikes me as almost a metaphor for the destruction of the state,” Carlson said about the state’s power company. “Here’s the utility which doesn’t really know anything about its own infrastructure but knows everything about the race of its employees. How did we get there?”After noting that he lives near one of the fires in the Los Angeles area, Rubin immediately took aim at liberal politics as the main reason the wildfires have grown so large and dangerous.“The problem right now is that everything, EVERYTHING, from academia to public utilities to politics, everything that goes woke, that buys into this ridiculous progressive ideology that cares about what contractors are LGBT or how many black firemen we have or white this or Asian that, everything that goes that road eventually breaks down,” he declared.As Carlson nodded and said “that’s true,” Rubin continued, complaining that this isn’t how “freedom is supposed to operate.”“What is supposed to happen—imagine if your house was on fire,” he added. “Would you care what the public utility or what the fire company, what contractor they brought in, what gender or sexuality or any of those things he or she was? It’s just absolutely ridiculous.”The Fox News host continued to agree with Rubin, who went on to tie PG&E;’s preemptive blackouts to a lack of “libertarian or conservative-minded people in California to fight what the progressives are doing to the state.”“If you can’t keep the lights on and you can’t keep the place from burning down, you’ve reached the point where there is no kind of lying about it anymore,” Carlson concluded. “It’s falling apart.

A staffer sitting behind her was captured on video as her eyes widened in shock.""You have demonstrated that you will pursue this heinous white supremacist ideology at all costs,"" said Wasserman Schultz. Cuccinelli answered that neither he nor the President was a white supremacist.""That's false,"" Cuccinelli said, calling Wasserman Schultz's statements ""defamatory.""Cuccinelli had been summoned to the hearing to discuss the Trump administration's decision to temporarily stop granting deportation deferments for illegal aliens receiving life-saving treatment in the U.S.Representative Ayanna Pressley (D., Ohio) also entered into a heated exchange with Cuccinelli over who was responsible for the decision, himself or White House officials. Cuccinelli repeatedly asserted that he made the decision and that no White House official was involved.Trump had considered appointing Cuccinelli secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. However, Senator Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) said the idea was a non-starter.“It’s my understanding that the existing law would not permit him to” lead the organization, Grassley said. “I don’t know how you get around that.” Grassley was referring to current laws that govern succession rules within the federal government.On Tuesday, a top Border Patrol official warned that illegal immigration could hit crisis levels if courts keep blocking Trump's immigration policies.""We will go back, mark the words, we will go back to the crisis level that we had before,"" said chief of law enforcement operations for the Border Patrol Brian Hastings.

The Democrats&#39; impeachment process has a credibility problem,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 10:02:29 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/democrats-impeachment-process-credibility-problem-140229011.html,"Has the House impeachment inquiry hit a brick wall on credibility? Or have House Democrats decided to call Republicans' bluff?After weeks of refusing to hold a full floor vote to formally launch an impeachment inquiry, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) abruptly changed position this week. A Thursday vote will set out more clear parameters for the ongoing investigation without explicitly declaring an impeachment inquiry, but it's far from clear whether this changes anything appreciably -- or if there's anything to change with the current focus on Ukraine policy as the predicate for impeachment.The bill that emerged Tuesday afternoon appears to directly address some of the key criticisms of House Republicans, who grew so frustrated with the closed hearings that they staged an intervention of sorts last week, breaching the Secure Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) in which the depositions were being taken under the control of House Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff. That set off worries among Democrats that further such demonstrations could obstruct and drag out the impeachment process into next year and into the election cycle, something Pelosi would like to avoid.Democrats' claims that the demonstrations were a GOP stunt had some basis in fact. Some of the Republicans who participated actually did have access to the hearings as members of three committees participating in the testimony. Contrary to some claims made at the time, Republican committee members had the opportunity to ask questions of the witnesses during the deposition and were very engaged in that process.Still, other Republican complaints had started to take their toll. Republicans wanted Democrats to hold a full House vote to openly authorize an impeachment inquiry, rather than use committees to conduct an ad hoc investigation while House Democratic leadership publicly acknowledged that impeachment was the goal. They also wanted open hearings with the witnesses being subpoenaed, which Democrats refused to grant in order to keep witnesses from knowing preceding testimony. Democrats pointed out that the House rules allowed for closed-session depositions and compared them to secret grand-jury proceedings, but Republicans countered that grand juries don't leak characterizations of the testimony at pressers, as Schiff and other Democrats had been doing all along.That has made the proceedings seem as though they're being conducted by a kangaroo court, which has allowed Trump to argue that the process is corrupt. The only way to gain traction for this process is to give it more credibility -- and to call the bluff of Republicans and Trump. Thus, Pelosi introduced a bill that will allow Republicans to call their own witnesses and to access all deposition materials, under the same rules used in the Bill Clinton impeachment process in 1998. The bill also establishes a mechanism for the full release of testimony, which Republicans have repeatedly demanded.This presents an immediate tactical risk for the White House. One of Pelosi's motives is to parry Trump's refusal to cooperate based on a lack of formal approval by the full House. A federal court ruled against Trump last week, but Trump can tie that question up for months on appeals, time that Pelosi perceives she does not have. A full House vote approving these rules not only means that Republicans no longer have due-process complaints (at least going forward), it signals to courts that the full House has indeed given tacit approval for an impeachment inquiry in providing a relatively fair structure for it.However, Pelosi is more worried about a different court: the court of public opinion. That perception that the impeachment process is unfair has hampered Democrats' ability to generate the kind of public support they need to take this to a full vote on impeachment without risking the gains Pelosi made in the 2018 midterms. National polling showing support for impeachment gaining momentum overall, but the response from the American public looks quite different on a state-by-state basis. A poll by The New York Times and Siena College last week showed that voters in six critical swing states with the closest margins in 2016 generally oppose impeachment, 43/53. Those numbers would suggest that continuing on this impeachment process might produce a Pyrrhic victory for Democrats in 2020, one that could produce a historic win for an already-impeached president for the first time ever.To fix that problem, and to force the Senate to take this more seriously, Pelosi has to revamp the process to provide at least the appearance of fairness. However, it's not likely to matter in the end. Impeachment is only the first step in the removal process, and in this case it's likely to be the last step Democrats can successfully take.The Republicans control the Senate, but their majority matters less than the fact that Democrats don't have a supermajority. If Democrats had uncovered a truly serious crime in this probe, that would likely convince at least 20 Senate Republicans to make Mike Pence president. The core problem is that Ukraine-Gate doesn't appear to involve an explicit statutory crime at all, but instead an alleged abuse of authority to gain political advantage over former Vice President Joe Biden. The House can decide what constitutes an impeachable offense, but the Senate decides whether it's even worthy of a full trial, let alone a removal.An impeachment without a removal will, in the end, look a lot like a political campaign no matter how much Pelosi improves the process. Voters will ask themselves why Democrats spent all year obsessed with impeachment under varying rationalizations and then chose the one issue on which they could almost guarantee no success in removal. Pelosi may win a tactical victory with this upcoming vote, but it's not going to solve the big strategic issue awaiting Democrats at the end of this process.Want more essential commentary and analysis like this delivered straight to your inbox?

"Former &lt;/&gt;Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:11:25 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/former-time-editor-wants-hate-211125098.html,"A former Time editor claimed that the United States needs a law banning hate speech, and that President Donald Trump “might be in violation of it” if there were one -- because, apparently, he doesn’t notice the irony of holding both of these views at once.In a Tuesday tweet promoting his Washington Post piece, titled “Why America needs a hate speech law,” Richard Stengel stated:> My @WashingtonPost piece on why the very broadness of the First Amendment suggests we should have a hate speech law. And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f> > -- Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019In the piece, Stengel writes that “many nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred” in the wake of World War II:> These laws started out as protections against the kinds of anti-Semitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws, but there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general, hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.“I’m all for protecting ‘thought that we hate,’ but not speech that incites hate,” he continues. “It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.”It’s interesting how Stengel actually does acknowledge the fact that “there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is,” and yet he still wants laws banning it. This makes absolutely no sense. After all, when he calls for laws to ban “hate speech,” he is, inherently, giving the government the power to decide what would and would not qualify -- the exact same government that is led by Donald Trump, and that is full of people who support him.In other words: Stengel somehow trusts that the government will have the same view of “hate speech” as he does, and then, in the same thought, seems to acknowledge that there’s actually no way that many of them would. Unless he thinks that the president and his congressional supporters would actually pass a law that they’d be in violation of, his argument for “hate speech” laws winds up being a pretty great argument against them.It’s ironic, but it’s not new: More often than not, it’s the uber-progressives arguing for laws against “hate speech” -- despite the fact that they’re often the same people who are also arguing that Donald Trump and Republicans are constantly spewing it. Maybe it’s just me, but if I thought that the leader of my government was, you know, literally Hitler or whatever, the last thing that I’d want would be to give that person and their supporters control over my speech.Yes, the First Amendment gives us the right to be “offensive” with our speech. Given the fact that a new thing seems to be declared “racist” or “sexist” every day, I’m certainly glad that we do have this protection. After all, it would only take there being a few too many of the “super woke” in our government for a phrase like “you guys” to become a criminal offense.The truth is, though, the right to be “offensive” (however you define that subjective term, anyway) is not even the most important role that our First Amendment plays. No, what’s most important is that it protects our right to speak out against the government when we see fit -- without having to worry about its retaliation. Like it or not, the only way to ensure that we retain this important check on government power is to never (ever) give its leaders a vehicle take it away.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eTNessteMBpuBTcqmJGuYw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/bae9af12e23cce197b317b5c1be56053,"Former </>Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony"

"More than 1,000 homeless people died in Los Angeles county last year","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 16:20:14 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/homeless-deaths-la-county-double-202014816.html,"The county’s public health department has reported 1,047 deaths for last year, a number that has increased steadily since 2013A woman pushes a cart full of her belongings past tents near Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles. Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty ImagesMore than 1,000 homeless people died in Los Angeles county in 2018, double the number of deaths from six years ago. The increase is a stark illustration of the region’s severe housing crisis, advocates said.The LA county public health department reported this week that 1,047 homeless people died last year, a number that has steadily increased every year since 2013, when 536 people died. The leading causes of death were coronary heart disease, which accounted for 22% of deaths, followed by alcohol and drug overdose at 21%, transportation-related injuries at 9%, homicides at 6% and suicides at 5%.The data sheds light on a worsening public health emergency in the county, where officials estimate there are now 59,000 people homeless, including more than 44,000 people who are living unsheltered – in cars, tents, or makeshift quarters. The report also follows a string of high-profile attacks against homeless people in the area, including the killing of Darrell Fields, a beloved musician who was burned to death in his tent on Skid Row.“We’ve got three people a day dying on the streets,” said Adam Rice, an organizer with Los Angeles Community Action Network (LA Can), a group that had worked closely with Fields. “It is a complete failure of leadership. Darrell didn’t need to die. None of these people needed to die. The reason this is happening is because there’s not proper housing.”Darrell Fields, 62, was a homeless man in Los Angeles known as Mr Guitar. He was killed in August when his tent was set ablaze. Photograph: Los Angeles Community Action NetworkSoaring rents and a major shortage of affordable housing have pushed people out of their homes in the area, with more than half of unsheltered adults in a recent count saying they were experiencing homelessness for the first time. The county estimated that there are now 8,800 homeless families.“It brings an overwhelming sadness when you think about precious human beings dying in our streets when it can be avoided,” said the Rev Andy Bales, CEO of Union Rescue Mission (URM), which runs a shelter at Skid Row, at the epicenter of the crisis in downtown LA.The county’s analysis also found that the mortality rate among homeless people has also jumped: “Put simply, being homeless in LA county is becoming increasingly deadly,” the agency wrote.The increase in overdoses represented the largest jump in terms of causes of death, the report found. In addition, the mortality rate among white homeless people has decreased while the rate of deaths for black and Latino residents has increased, the county said. Overall, African Americans are four times more likely to experience homelessness in LA county than other groups.Of the transportation-related deaths, which include vehicle and train collisions, 82% of victims were pedestrians and cyclists.The county and local clinics have increasingly sent healthcare workers to encampments to try to serve people on the streets. More than 21,000 homeless people were also placed in housing last year, an increase from 2017, officials reported early this year.The health department report this week recommended more direct outreach to homeless people, the creation of a “death review team” to study the subject and more traffic safety measures near encampments.Bales predicted that medical visits were not enough to reverse the deadly trends: “What we need most is for everyone to be immediately under a roof and protected from the elements. Until that happens, the death rates will continue to grow … and more and more people will be devastated by homelessness.”The crisis demanded a more urgent response, he added: “How much evidence do we need to gather before we decide not to let another human being die on the street?”LA’s homeless crisis has recently received national attention, with the Trump administration suggesting it could pursue some kind of law enforcement crackdown, drawing skepticism from some local organizations. Advocates have criticized efforts to further criminalize people living on the streets and have argued that the government needs to put more funding to housing and shelter.“It’s really a travesty when you think about it. How many deaths could’ve been prevented?” said Kourtney Milligan, a 29-year-old homeless woman, who has lived on Skid Row. “The resources that they say are out there are so hard to find.”",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/s2XrfBGfKBrVbz9mGlm7bg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/f15aa3ae803200f5d01035f9967bdb02,"More than 1,000 homeless people died in Los Angeles county last year"
South Africans Face Tax Increases as Revenue Collection Lags,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 08:05:09 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/south-africans-face-tax-increases-120509942.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Explore what’s moving the global economy in the new season of the Stephanomics podcast. Subscribe via Pocket Cast or iTunes.South Africans have to brace for higher taxes next year as revenue collection falls short of estimates.Bailouts for the state-owned power utility, broadcaster, airlines and arms maker – together with a failure to curb the public-sector wage bill and stem fiscal leakages – have sapped the state’s resources. Africa’s most-industrialized economy hasn’t expanded by more than 2% annually since 2013, damping confidence and resulting in the longest business-cycle downturn since 1945, weighing on tax income.The National Treasury increased the value-added tax rate last year for the time in more than two decades and has also raised taxes for high-income earners to plug the widening budget deficit. That has added to the strain on consumption spending and economic growth.“Significant tax increases over the past several years leave only moderate scope to boost tax revenue at this time,” the Treasury said in its medium-term budget policy statement released Wednesday in Cape Town. Additional tax measures are under consideration to raise an extra 10 billion rand ($683 million) in fiscal 2021, it said, without giving details.“Given the fiscal position we find ourselves in, all tax options need to be on the table,” said Chris Axelson, chief director for economic tax analysis in the Treasury.The South African Revenue Service will probably collect 1.37 trillion rand in the 2020 fiscal year, 52.5 billion rand less than forecast in February, the Treasury said. The shortfall will be 84 billion rand in 2021 and 114.7 billion rand in 2022, it said.The shortfall reflects “job losses, lower wage settlements and smaller bonuses reducing personal income-tax collection,” the Treasury said. Reduced profitability in a difficult trading environment meant lower-than-expected corporate income-tax collections, while weak household consumption moderated the increase in revenue from value-added tax, it said.The February budget included 7 billion rand from the sale of non-core assets by March, but “there is a risk these sales will not be completed by the end of the financial year,” the Treasury said.The government insists that citizens of Gauteng – which houses the financial hub of Johannesburg and the capital, Pretoria – must pay for electronically administered tolls to use the province’s roads, and will strengthen compliance measures.In July, Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula said South Africa is considering the options available on scrapping the tolls.“Not paying your tolls has already led to our roads deteriorating,” Finance Minister Tito Mboweni said in a prepared copy if his speech. “We have been unable to maintain the network. I urge the nation to please pay your bills.”\--With assistance from Zoe Schneeweiss.To contact the reporter on this story: Ana Monteiro in Johannesburg at amonteiro4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Rene Vollgraaff at rvollgraaff@bloomberg.net, Robert BrandFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uvN2DnzYlF.TzezBAQo5Gg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/8a4780226c720322234fa6fbc613c5e6,South Africans Face Tax Increases as Revenue Collection Lags

"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:17:36 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/record-wave-lone-child-migrants-122133758.html,"TENOSIQUE, Mexico -- The United States has detained more children trying to cross the nation's southwest border on their own over the last year than during any other period on record, surpassing the surge of unaccompanied minors that set off a crisis during the Obama administration, according to new figures released Tuesday.U.S. immigration authorities apprehended 76,020 minors, most of them from Central America, traveling without their parents in the fiscal year that ended in September -- 52% more than during the last fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Mexico is experiencing the same surge. Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period -- pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.In interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous -- and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.""These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,"" Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters. ""And each month during the fiscal year, the numbers increased. You saw them. We all saw them.""The young migrants came alongside a historic wave of families traveling together, also largely from Central America. They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.Marvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced -- and he pressed on.""Quitting was not an option,"" Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. ""You wipe your tears and carry on.""For the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they'd kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.His parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said. ""We can't bear losing another son,"" they told him. ""You have to go.""He left home in the spring, with $40 in his pocket and no plan except to find work in a safer place.As for most underage migrants traveling without their parents, his trip north has been a feat of improvisation and courage. He walked and hitchhiked through Honduras and Guatemala. He slept in churches, under trees or wherever he found himself when night fell.Along the way, he gathered crucial bits of information from fellow migrants: the best route to take, locations of shelters up ahead, places to avoid, where to forage for food.As huge numbers of young migrants from Central America began arriving at the United States' southern border in 2014, the Obama administration scrambled to house them until they could be released to sponsors -- adults who applied to care for them. The shelter system grew dramatically as a result.The Trump administration experienced similar backups at the border just a few years later -- this time because of new, more stringent policies that made the sponsors themselves, who are often undocumented, vulnerable to immigration authorities. This discouraged people from coming forward, leaving thousands of children to languish in the system.The Trump administration has also sought to deter migration by separating thousands of children from their relatives, again driving up the number of children in federally contracted shelters.On the road, while trying to avoid detention, fear and hunger are constant companions for many young migrants.With little or no money in their pockets, they relied on strangers for snacks or meals. They pawed through garbage and scanned drifts of debris on the roadside, hoping to spot an edible morsel.Wilson, a 17-year-old Honduran, said he had feasted on rotten mangos discarded by street vendors.""I used to drink water from potholes when I was too thirsty,"" interjected Mario Leonel, 16, who left home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, several weeks ago without notifying his parents. ""That is the hardest part of it all: the hunger.""When he arrived at the shelter in Tenosique, a small Mexican town near the Guatemala border, he called his parents in Honduras, who burst into tears and pleaded for him to return. He said no. He was tired of all the violence in his country, and wanted to get asylum in the United States.After Marvel slipped across the Guatemala-Mexico border in May, he found room at a shelter in Tenosique, which serves as a transit point for many migrants. He quickly made new friends among other teenage migrants who had made it this far, mainly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador.On a recent afternoon, several of them gathered in a two-story building that had been reserved for minors, its walls painted with colorful animal murals. The boys cracked jokes, roughhoused and argued about who was the cutest girl in the shelter.Outside, Dulce, a 16-year-old transgender migrant from Guatemala, sat alone on train tracks pining for a boy she had met at the shelter. He had left without explanation and she was lovesick.""I just can't get him out of my mind,"" she said.She left her hometown four months earlier to escape abuse from her family and strangers, including a sexual assault by gang members when she was 12. She made it as far as central Mexico before being detained and deported. Five days after returning home, she set off again.""I left because I had nothing there and no one to protect me,"" she said. ""At least here I am safe.""Though the United States remains the destination of choice for most unaccompanied minors, an increasing number are setting their sights no farther than Mexico, advocates and migrants say.Sometimes they have no choice: Mexico's increased enforcement measures have made it more difficult for migrants to make it to the border with the United States. And even if they reach the United States, recent policies have drastically lowered the possibilities of getting asylum.In Mexico, when unaccompanied minors are detained, the law mandates that they be released right away into the custody of the national child protection agency, which finds them accommodation in shelters designed for children.But migrants' advocates say the government has been holding children in the nation's overcrowded detention centers for far too long, and that some children are quickly funneled into the deportation process rather than being given a fair chance to seek asylum or some other form of relief.""No child should ever be held at a detention center,"" said Elba Coria, a migration expert from the Clinic for Refugees at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City. ""But while international standards consider children's detention as an exceptional measure, amid Mexico's migration chaos, it is the rule.""Neither Marvel nor any of his new friends in the Tenosique shelter had been detained by the authorities. All had managed to cross into Mexico from Guatemala and had applied for asylum in Mexico after talking through their options with the shelter staff.They now plan to remain in Mexico and look for work and study opportunities -- even if they haven't abandoned hope of making it to the United States.""It is every Honduran's boy dream to get to the United States, where there is more money and kids are able to go to school,"" said Jose Angel, 17. He was born with a disability that left him unable to use his arms and left his hometown because his grandmother could no longer take care of him.He was hopeful he could apply for asylum in the United States despite Trump's many efforts to severely lower the number of people granted asylum. ""It is scary, but you have to take a chance,"" he said.On a recent morning, Alan, a 17-year-old Guatemalan migrant, sat on the sidewalk outside a migrant shelter in the city of Palenque, in southern Mexico. He had just crossed the border and was exhausted. Mexican immigration officials had stopped a bus he was on, but he managed to escape into the countryside and hide.Alan planned to take a nap, shower and have a meal before trying illegally to board a freight train known as The Beast. It runs from Mexico's border with Guatemala to its border with the United States and, for decades, migrants have clung to it to speed through much of Mexico.His hope was to make it to the U.S. border and petition for asylum. He was undeterred by Trump's recent efforts to restrict asylum claims or curb immigration.""One way or another, I have to make it to the other side where there are skyscrapers and life is better,"" he said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5ol82jExNHqBHa7IGzz2mw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/03f35d3f9d537a8dc9fe503d06c098de,"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation"
Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 10:05:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-warren-untenable-plans-140521979.html,"If you’ve been having trouble finding someone to walk your dog, don’t worry. Any day now, Elizabeth Warren will announce “a plan for that.” It will undoubtedly be comprehensive, detailed, and replete with subsidies for lower- and middle-class dog walkers and underserved breeds. It will cost tens of billions of dollars and will receive widespread positive notice from the media. However, to judge by her other recent plans, the one thing it won’t include is any discussion of how she plans to pay for it.The Massachusetts senator has challenged and possibly overtaken former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, largely based on having a plan for the government to tackle every problem facing this country, no matter how big or how small, from issues with military housing to Puerto Rican debt to climate change.The price tag for this massive expansion of government is enormous. Much of the attention in recent weeks has been focused on Warren’s embrace of Medicare for All, which she refuses to admit would require an increase in middle-class taxes. Even Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has conceded that such proposals, which would cost $30–40 trillion over 10 years, cannot be financed without tax hikes. Warren’s refusal to address this obvious fact makes her look less like a would-be policy wonk and more like a typical politician.But even setting aside Medicare for All, Warren’s plans are likely to dump oceans of red ink onto our growing national debt. Her non-health-care spending proposals already total some $7.5 trillion per year over the next 10 years. Although these are not quite Bernie levels of government largesse, her proposals would still require nearly double our current levels of spending.To pay for all this, Warren proposes a variety of tax hikes, mostly designed to hit corporations or high-earners: higher payroll taxes for those earning more than $250,000 per year; a 7 percent profits tax on companies earning more than $100 million; a 60 percent lobbying tax on firms that spend a million or more on lobbying, and so forth. But the biggest chunk of money would come from Warren’s proposed “wealth tax,” a 2 to 3 percent levy on net worth above $50 million. Warren estimates that this wealth tax will pull in more than $2.75 trillion over ten years. It won’t.First, there is the slight problem that a wealth tax is probably unconstitutional. Of course, constitutional constraints are quaint notions in the Age of Trump. Regardless, it is worth noting that the Constitution permits the federal government to impose only “direct taxes,” such as a property tax. That’s why it required a constitutional amendment to enact the federal income tax. Many constitutional scholars warn that a wealth tax is neither a direct tax nor income tax.Even if Warren can find a way around the constitutional guardrails -- perhaps by something such as a retrospective wealth tax in which you wait until a taxpayer sells assets or passes away -- a wealth tax is unlikely to raise anywhere near the amount of money she predicts.Simply look at Europe’s experiments with wealth taxes. At one time, a dozen European countries imposed wealth taxes. Today, all but three have abandoned those levies. Among those repealing their wealth tax are the Scandinavian social democracies that Warren admires, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Norway retains a wealth tax but has significantly reduced it in recent years. Additional countries abandoning the tax include Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Other countries, such as Great Britain, have considered wealth taxes and rejected them.They did so because wealth taxes are administratively complex and difficult to enforce. Also, they significantly reduce investment, entrepreneurship, and, ultimately, economic growth. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, European wealth taxes raised, on average, only about 0.2 percent of GDP in revenues. By comparison, the U.S. federal income tax raises 8 percent of GDP.Two groups, however, would benefit substantially from a wealth tax. The tax would be a full-employment opportunity for the tax-preparation industry and for lawyers. After all, we would now have to determine fair market value for everything from homes and vehicles to artwork and jewelry to family pension rights and intellectual property. The other big winner would be lobbyists, who could be expected to descend on Washington en masse seeking exemptions and exceptions for their clients. If you think the tax code is a mess today, just wait until D.C. is done with Warren’s plan.There is an old Yiddish proverb that goes “Mann tracht, un Gott Lacht,” or “Man plans, and God laughs.” It is all well and good that Senator Warren has a plan for everything. But until she actually figures out how to pay for everything without crippling our economy, such plans really don’t add up.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/t_XOfhQ2Q8pn0Eihbaza4g--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/710b4188b8e44ebd02c332c03dfb8d66,Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans

Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he’s going to take her brother’s guns.After a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they’d continue the conversation in the next segment.“No we’re not,” McCain grumbled. “It’s fine.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Tucker Carlson and Guest Blame Diversity and ‘Woke’ Culture for California Fires,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 07:17:19 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/tucker-carlson-guest-blame-diversity-032855316.html,"Fox NewsFox News host Tucker Carlson and his guest, conservative YouTube personality Dave Rubin, both insisted Tuesday night that the wildfires burning across California are due largely to progressive ideology, “woke” culture, and diversity in hiring.During Tuesday’s broadcast of Tucker Carlson Tonight, Carlson welcomed on Rubin, a political commentator and podcaster, to discuss the issues surrounding the large fires engulfing the state, including those related to the electrical grid and firefighting methods.“PG&E; strikes me as almost a metaphor for the destruction of the state,” Carlson said about the state’s power company. “Here’s the utility which doesn’t really know anything about its own infrastructure but knows everything about the race of its employees. How did we get there?”After noting that he lives near one of the fires in the Los Angeles area, Rubin immediately took aim at liberal politics as the main reason the wildfires have grown so large and dangerous.“The problem right now is that everything, EVERYTHING, from academia to public utilities to politics, everything that goes woke, that buys into this ridiculous progressive ideology that cares about what contractors are LGBT or how many black firemen we have or white this or Asian that, everything that goes that road eventually breaks down,” he declared.As Carlson nodded and said “that’s true,” Rubin continued, complaining that this isn’t how “freedom is supposed to operate.”“What is supposed to happen—imagine if your house was on fire,” he added. “Would you care what the public utility or what the fire company, what contractor they brought in, what gender or sexuality or any of those things he or she was? It’s just absolutely ridiculous.”The Fox News host continued to agree with Rubin, who went on to tie PG&E;’s preemptive blackouts to a lack of “libertarian or conservative-minded people in California to fight what the progressives are doing to the state.”“If you can’t keep the lights on and you can’t keep the place from burning down, you’ve reached the point where there is no kind of lying about it anymore,” Carlson concluded. “It’s falling apart.

A staffer sitting behind her was captured on video as her eyes widened in shock.""You have demonstrated that you will pursue this heinous white supremacist ideology at all costs,"" said Wasserman Schultz. Cuccinelli answered that neither he nor the President was a white supremacist.""That's false,"" Cuccinelli said, calling Wasserman Schultz's statements ""defamatory.""Cuccinelli had been summoned to the hearing to discuss the Trump administration's decision to temporarily stop granting deportation deferments for illegal aliens receiving life-saving treatment in the U.S.Representative Ayanna Pressley (D., Ohio) also entered into a heated exchange with Cuccinelli over who was responsible for the decision, himself or White House officials. Cuccinelli repeatedly asserted that he made the decision and that no White House official was involved.Trump had considered appointing Cuccinelli secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. However, Senator Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) said the idea was a non-starter.“It’s my understanding that the existing law would not permit him to” lead the organization, Grassley said. “I don’t know how you get around that.” Grassley was referring to current laws that govern succession rules within the federal government.On Tuesday, a top Border Patrol official warned that illegal immigration could hit crisis levels if courts keep blocking Trump's immigration policies.""We will go back, mark the words, we will go back to the crisis level that we had before,"" said chief of law enforcement operations for the Border Patrol Brian Hastings.

The Democrats&#39; impeachment process has a credibility problem,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 10:02:29 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/democrats-impeachment-process-credibility-problem-140229011.html,"Has the House impeachment inquiry hit a brick wall on credibility? Or have House Democrats decided to call Republicans' bluff?After weeks of refusing to hold a full floor vote to formally launch an impeachment inquiry, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) abruptly changed position this week. A Thursday vote will set out more clear parameters for the ongoing investigation without explicitly declaring an impeachment inquiry, but it's far from clear whether this changes anything appreciably -- or if there's anything to change with the current focus on Ukraine policy as the predicate for impeachment.The bill that emerged Tuesday afternoon appears to directly address some of the key criticisms of House Republicans, who grew so frustrated with the closed hearings that they staged an intervention of sorts last week, breaching the Secure Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) in which the depositions were being taken under the control of House Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff. That set off worries among Democrats that further such demonstrations could obstruct and drag out the impeachment process into next year and into the election cycle, something Pelosi would like to avoid.Democrats' claims that the demonstrations were a GOP stunt had some basis in fact. Some of the Republicans who participated actually did have access to the hearings as members of three committees participating in the testimony. Contrary to some claims made at the time, Republican committee members had the opportunity to ask questions of the witnesses during the deposition and were very engaged in that process.Still, other Republican complaints had started to take their toll. Republicans wanted Democrats to hold a full House vote to openly authorize an impeachment inquiry, rather than use committees to conduct an ad hoc investigation while House Democratic leadership publicly acknowledged that impeachment was the goal. They also wanted open hearings with the witnesses being subpoenaed, which Democrats refused to grant in order to keep witnesses from knowing preceding testimony. Democrats pointed out that the House rules allowed for closed-session depositions and compared them to secret grand-jury proceedings, but Republicans countered that grand juries don't leak characterizations of the testimony at pressers, as Schiff and other Democrats had been doing all along.That has made the proceedings seem as though they're being conducted by a kangaroo court, which has allowed Trump to argue that the process is corrupt. The only way to gain traction for this process is to give it more credibility -- and to call the bluff of Republicans and Trump. Thus, Pelosi introduced a bill that will allow Republicans to call their own witnesses and to access all deposition materials, under the same rules used in the Bill Clinton impeachment process in 1998. The bill also establishes a mechanism for the full release of testimony, which Republicans have repeatedly demanded.This presents an immediate tactical risk for the White House. One of Pelosi's motives is to parry Trump's refusal to cooperate based on a lack of formal approval by the full House. A federal court ruled against Trump last week, but Trump can tie that question up for months on appeals, time that Pelosi perceives she does not have. A full House vote approving these rules not only means that Republicans no longer have due-process complaints (at least going forward), it signals to courts that the full House has indeed given tacit approval for an impeachment inquiry in providing a relatively fair structure for it.However, Pelosi is more worried about a different court: the court of public opinion. That perception that the impeachment process is unfair has hampered Democrats' ability to generate the kind of public support they need to take this to a full vote on impeachment without risking the gains Pelosi made in the 2018 midterms. National polling showing support for impeachment gaining momentum overall, but the response from the American public looks quite different on a state-by-state basis. A poll by The New York Times and Siena College last week showed that voters in six critical swing states with the closest margins in 2016 generally oppose impeachment, 43/53. Those numbers would suggest that continuing on this impeachment process might produce a Pyrrhic victory for Democrats in 2020, one that could produce a historic win for an already-impeached president for the first time ever.To fix that problem, and to force the Senate to take this more seriously, Pelosi has to revamp the process to provide at least the appearance of fairness. However, it's not likely to matter in the end. Impeachment is only the first step in the removal process, and in this case it's likely to be the last step Democrats can successfully take.The Republicans control the Senate, but their majority matters less than the fact that Democrats don't have a supermajority. If Democrats had uncovered a truly serious crime in this probe, that would likely convince at least 20 Senate Republicans to make Mike Pence president. The core problem is that Ukraine-Gate doesn't appear to involve an explicit statutory crime at all, but instead an alleged abuse of authority to gain political advantage over former Vice President Joe Biden. The House can decide what constitutes an impeachable offense, but the Senate decides whether it's even worthy of a full trial, let alone a removal.An impeachment without a removal will, in the end, look a lot like a political campaign no matter how much Pelosi improves the process. Voters will ask themselves why Democrats spent all year obsessed with impeachment under varying rationalizations and then chose the one issue on which they could almost guarantee no success in removal. Pelosi may win a tactical victory with this upcoming vote, but it's not going to solve the big strategic issue awaiting Democrats at the end of this process.Want more essential commentary and analysis like this delivered straight to your inbox?

"Former &lt;/&gt;Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:11:25 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/former-time-editor-wants-hate-211125098.html,"A former Time editor claimed that the United States needs a law banning hate speech, and that President Donald Trump “might be in violation of it” if there were one -- because, apparently, he doesn’t notice the irony of holding both of these views at once.In a Tuesday tweet promoting his Washington Post piece, titled “Why America needs a hate speech law,” Richard Stengel stated:> My @WashingtonPost piece on why the very broadness of the First Amendment suggests we should have a hate speech law. And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f> > -- Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019In the piece, Stengel writes that “many nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred” in the wake of World War II:> These laws started out as protections against the kinds of anti-Semitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws, but there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general, hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.“I’m all for protecting ‘thought that we hate,’ but not speech that incites hate,” he continues. “It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.”It’s interesting how Stengel actually does acknowledge the fact that “there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is,” and yet he still wants laws banning it. This makes absolutely no sense. After all, when he calls for laws to ban “hate speech,” he is, inherently, giving the government the power to decide what would and would not qualify -- the exact same government that is led by Donald Trump, and that is full of people who support him.In other words: Stengel somehow trusts that the government will have the same view of “hate speech” as he does, and then, in the same thought, seems to acknowledge that there’s actually no way that many of them would. Unless he thinks that the president and his congressional supporters would actually pass a law that they’d be in violation of, his argument for “hate speech” laws winds up being a pretty great argument against them.It’s ironic, but it’s not new: More often than not, it’s the uber-progressives arguing for laws against “hate speech” -- despite the fact that they’re often the same people who are also arguing that Donald Trump and Republicans are constantly spewing it. Maybe it’s just me, but if I thought that the leader of my government was, you know, literally Hitler or whatever, the last thing that I’d want would be to give that person and their supporters control over my speech.Yes, the First Amendment gives us the right to be “offensive” with our speech. Given the fact that a new thing seems to be declared “racist” or “sexist” every day, I’m certainly glad that we do have this protection. After all, it would only take there being a few too many of the “super woke” in our government for a phrase like “you guys” to become a criminal offense.The truth is, though, the right to be “offensive” (however you define that subjective term, anyway) is not even the most important role that our First Amendment plays. No, what’s most important is that it protects our right to speak out against the government when we see fit -- without having to worry about its retaliation. Like it or not, the only way to ensure that we retain this important check on government power is to never (ever) give its leaders a vehicle take it away.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eTNessteMBpuBTcqmJGuYw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/bae9af12e23cce197b317b5c1be56053,"Former </>Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony"

"More than 1,000 homeless people died in Los Angeles county last year","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 16:20:14 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/homeless-deaths-la-county-double-202014816.html,"The county’s public health department has reported 1,047 deaths for last year, a number that has increased steadily since 2013A woman pushes a cart full of her belongings past tents near Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles. Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty ImagesMore than 1,000 homeless people died in Los Angeles county in 2018, double the number of deaths from six years ago. The increase is a stark illustration of the region’s severe housing crisis, advocates said.The LA county public health department reported this week that 1,047 homeless people died last year, a number that has steadily increased every year since 2013, when 536 people died. The leading causes of death were coronary heart disease, which accounted for 22% of deaths, followed by alcohol and drug overdose at 21%, transportation-related injuries at 9%, homicides at 6% and suicides at 5%.The data sheds light on a worsening public health emergency in the county, where officials estimate there are now 59,000 people homeless, including more than 44,000 people who are living unsheltered – in cars, tents, or makeshift quarters. The report also follows a string of high-profile attacks against homeless people in the area, including the killing of Darrell Fields, a beloved musician who was burned to death in his tent on Skid Row.“We’ve got three people a day dying on the streets,” said Adam Rice, an organizer with Los Angeles Community Action Network (LA Can), a group that had worked closely with Fields. “It is a complete failure of leadership. Darrell didn’t need to die. None of these people needed to die. The reason this is happening is because there’s not proper housing.”Darrell Fields, 62, was a homeless man in Los Angeles known as Mr Guitar. He was killed in August when his tent was set ablaze. Photograph: Los Angeles Community Action NetworkSoaring rents and a major shortage of affordable housing have pushed people out of their homes in the area, with more than half of unsheltered adults in a recent count saying they were experiencing homelessness for the first time. The county estimated that there are now 8,800 homeless families.“It brings an overwhelming sadness when you think about precious human beings dying in our streets when it can be avoided,” said the Rev Andy Bales, CEO of Union Rescue Mission (URM), which runs a shelter at Skid Row, at the epicenter of the crisis in downtown LA.The county’s analysis also found that the mortality rate among homeless people has also jumped: “Put simply, being homeless in LA county is becoming increasingly deadly,” the agency wrote.The increase in overdoses represented the largest jump in terms of causes of death, the report found. In addition, the mortality rate among white homeless people has decreased while the rate of deaths for black and Latino residents has increased, the county said. Overall, African Americans are four times more likely to experience homelessness in LA county than other groups.Of the transportation-related deaths, which include vehicle and train collisions, 82% of victims were pedestrians and cyclists.The county and local clinics have increasingly sent healthcare workers to encampments to try to serve people on the streets. More than 21,000 homeless people were also placed in housing last year, an increase from 2017, officials reported early this year.The health department report this week recommended more direct outreach to homeless people, the creation of a “death review team” to study the subject and more traffic safety measures near encampments.Bales predicted that medical visits were not enough to reverse the deadly trends: “What we need most is for everyone to be immediately under a roof and protected from the elements. Until that happens, the death rates will continue to grow … and more and more people will be devastated by homelessness.”The crisis demanded a more urgent response, he added: “How much evidence do we need to gather before we decide not to let another human being die on the street?”LA’s homeless crisis has recently received national attention, with the Trump administration suggesting it could pursue some kind of law enforcement crackdown, drawing skepticism from some local organizations. Advocates have criticized efforts to further criminalize people living on the streets and have argued that the government needs to put more funding to housing and shelter.“It’s really a travesty when you think about it. How many deaths could’ve been prevented?” said Kourtney Milligan, a 29-year-old homeless woman, who has lived on Skid Row. “The resources that they say are out there are so hard to find.”",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/s2XrfBGfKBrVbz9mGlm7bg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/f15aa3ae803200f5d01035f9967bdb02,"More than 1,000 homeless people died in Los Angeles county last year"
South Africans Face Tax Increases as Revenue Collection Lags,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 08:05:09 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/south-africans-face-tax-increases-120509942.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Explore what’s moving the global economy in the new season of the Stephanomics podcast. Subscribe via Pocket Cast or iTunes.South Africans have to brace for higher taxes next year as revenue collection falls short of estimates.Bailouts for the state-owned power utility, broadcaster, airlines and arms maker – together with a failure to curb the public-sector wage bill and stem fiscal leakages – have sapped the state’s resources. Africa’s most-industrialized economy hasn’t expanded by more than 2% annually since 2013, damping confidence and resulting in the longest business-cycle downturn since 1945, weighing on tax income.The National Treasury increased the value-added tax rate last year for the time in more than two decades and has also raised taxes for high-income earners to plug the widening budget deficit. That has added to the strain on consumption spending and economic growth.“Significant tax increases over the past several years leave only moderate scope to boost tax revenue at this time,” the Treasury said in its medium-term budget policy statement released Wednesday in Cape Town. Additional tax measures are under consideration to raise an extra 10 billion rand ($683 million) in fiscal 2021, it said, without giving details.“Given the fiscal position we find ourselves in, all tax options need to be on the table,” said Chris Axelson, chief director for economic tax analysis in the Treasury.The South African Revenue Service will probably collect 1.37 trillion rand in the 2020 fiscal year, 52.5 billion rand less than forecast in February, the Treasury said. The shortfall will be 84 billion rand in 2021 and 114.7 billion rand in 2022, it said.The shortfall reflects “job losses, lower wage settlements and smaller bonuses reducing personal income-tax collection,” the Treasury said. Reduced profitability in a difficult trading environment meant lower-than-expected corporate income-tax collections, while weak household consumption moderated the increase in revenue from value-added tax, it said.The February budget included 7 billion rand from the sale of non-core assets by March, but “there is a risk these sales will not be completed by the end of the financial year,” the Treasury said.The government insists that citizens of Gauteng – which houses the financial hub of Johannesburg and the capital, Pretoria – must pay for electronically administered tolls to use the province’s roads, and will strengthen compliance measures.In July, Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula said South Africa is considering the options available on scrapping the tolls.“Not paying your tolls has already led to our roads deteriorating,” Finance Minister Tito Mboweni said in a prepared copy if his speech. “We have been unable to maintain the network. I urge the nation to please pay your bills.”\--With assistance from Zoe Schneeweiss.To contact the reporter on this story: Ana Monteiro in Johannesburg at amonteiro4@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Rene Vollgraaff at rvollgraaff@bloomberg.net, Robert BrandFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",http://l.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uvN2DnzYlF.TzezBAQo5Gg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/8a4780226c720322234fa6fbc613c5e6,South Africans Face Tax Increases as Revenue Collection Lags

"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:17:36 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/record-wave-lone-child-migrants-122133758.html,"TENOSIQUE, Mexico -- The United States has detained more children trying to cross the nation's southwest border on their own over the last year than during any other period on record, surpassing the surge of unaccompanied minors that set off a crisis during the Obama administration, according to new figures released Tuesday.U.S. immigration authorities apprehended 76,020 minors, most of them from Central America, traveling without their parents in the fiscal year that ended in September -- 52% more than during the last fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Mexico is experiencing the same surge. Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period -- pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.In interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous -- and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.""These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,"" Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters. ""And each month during the fiscal year, the numbers increased. You saw them. We all saw them.""The young migrants came alongside a historic wave of families traveling together, also largely from Central America. They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.Marvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced -- and he pressed on.""Quitting was not an option,"" Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. ""You wipe your tears and carry on.""For the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they'd kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.His parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said. ""We can't bear losing another son,"" they told him. ""You have to go.""He left home in the spring, with $40 in his pocket and no plan except to find work in a safer place.As for most underage migrants traveling without their parents, his trip north has been a feat of improvisation and courage. He walked and hitchhiked through Honduras and Guatemala. He slept in churches, under trees or wherever he found himself when night fell.Along the way, he gathered crucial bits of information from fellow migrants: the best route to take, locations of shelters up ahead, places to avoid, where to forage for food.As huge numbers of young migrants from Central America began arriving at the United States' southern border in 2014, the Obama administration scrambled to house them until they could be released to sponsors -- adults who applied to care for them. The shelter system grew dramatically as a result.The Trump administration experienced similar backups at the border just a few years later -- this time because of new, more stringent policies that made the sponsors themselves, who are often undocumented, vulnerable to immigration authorities. This discouraged people from coming forward, leaving thousands of children to languish in the system.The Trump administration has also sought to deter migration by separating thousands of children from their relatives, again driving up the number of children in federally contracted shelters.On the road, while trying to avoid detention, fear and hunger are constant companions for many young migrants.With little or no money in their pockets, they relied on strangers for snacks or meals. They pawed through garbage and scanned drifts of debris on the roadside, hoping to spot an edible morsel.Wilson, a 17-year-old Honduran, said he had feasted on rotten mangos discarded by street vendors.""I used to drink water from potholes when I was too thirsty,"" interjected Mario Leonel, 16, who left home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, several weeks ago without notifying his parents. ""That is the hardest part of it all: the hunger.""When he arrived at the shelter in Tenosique, a small Mexican town near the Guatemala border, he called his parents in Honduras, who burst into tears and pleaded for him to return. He said no. He was tired of all the violence in his country, and wanted to get asylum in the United States.After Marvel slipped across the Guatemala-Mexico border in May, he found room at a shelter in Tenosique, which serves as a transit point for many migrants. He quickly made new friends among other teenage migrants who had made it this far, mainly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador.On a recent afternoon, several of them gathered in a two-story building that had been reserved for minors, its walls painted with colorful animal murals. The boys cracked jokes, roughhoused and argued about who was the cutest girl in the shelter.Outside, Dulce, a 16-year-old transgender migrant from Guatemala, sat alone on train tracks pining for a boy she had met at the shelter. He had left without explanation and she was lovesick.""I just can't get him out of my mind,"" she said.She left her hometown four months earlier to escape abuse from her family and strangers, including a sexual assault by gang members when she was 12. She made it as far as central Mexico before being detained and deported. Five days after returning home, she set off again.""I left because I had nothing there and no one to protect me,"" she said. ""At least here I am safe.""Though the United States remains the destination of choice for most unaccompanied minors, an increasing number are setting their sights no farther than Mexico, advocates and migrants say.Sometimes they have no choice: Mexico's increased enforcement measures have made it more difficult for migrants to make it to the border with the United States. And even if they reach the United States, recent policies have drastically lowered the possibilities of getting asylum.In Mexico, when unaccompanied minors are detained, the law mandates that they be released right away into the custody of the national child protection agency, which finds them accommodation in shelters designed for children.But migrants' advocates say the government has been holding children in the nation's overcrowded detention centers for far too long, and that some children are quickly funneled into the deportation process rather than being given a fair chance to seek asylum or some other form of relief.""No child should ever be held at a detention center,"" said Elba Coria, a migration expert from the Clinic for Refugees at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City. ""But while international standards consider children's detention as an exceptional measure, amid Mexico's migration chaos, it is the rule.""Neither Marvel nor any of his new friends in the Tenosique shelter had been detained by the authorities. All had managed to cross into Mexico from Guatemala and had applied for asylum in Mexico after talking through their options with the shelter staff.They now plan to remain in Mexico and look for work and study opportunities -- even if they haven't abandoned hope of making it to the United States.""It is every Honduran's boy dream to get to the United States, where there is more money and kids are able to go to school,"" said Jose Angel, 17. He was born with a disability that left him unable to use his arms and left his hometown because his grandmother could no longer take care of him.He was hopeful he could apply for asylum in the United States despite Trump's many efforts to severely lower the number of people granted asylum. ""It is scary, but you have to take a chance,"" he said.On a recent morning, Alan, a 17-year-old Guatemalan migrant, sat on the sidewalk outside a migrant shelter in the city of Palenque, in southern Mexico. He had just crossed the border and was exhausted. Mexican immigration officials had stopped a bus he was on, but he managed to escape into the countryside and hide.Alan planned to take a nap, shower and have a meal before trying illegally to board a freight train known as The Beast. It runs from Mexico's border with Guatemala to its border with the United States and, for decades, migrants have clung to it to speed through much of Mexico.His hope was to make it to the U.S. border and petition for asylum. He was undeterred by Trump's recent efforts to restrict asylum claims or curb immigration.""One way or another, I have to make it to the other side where there are skyscrapers and life is better,"" he said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5ol82jExNHqBHa7IGzz2mw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/03f35d3f9d537a8dc9fe503d06c098de,"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation"

Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 10:05:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-warren-untenable-plans-140521979.html,"If you’ve been having trouble finding someone to walk your dog, don’t worry. Any day now, Elizabeth Warren will announce “a plan for that.” It will undoubtedly be comprehensive, detailed, and replete with subsidies for lower- and middle-class dog walkers and underserved breeds. It will cost tens of billions of dollars and will receive widespread positive notice from the media. However, to judge by her other recent plans, the one thing it won’t include is any discussion of how she plans to pay for it.The Massachusetts senator has challenged and possibly overtaken former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, largely based on having a plan for the government to tackle every problem facing this country, no matter how big or how small, from issues with military housing to Puerto Rican debt to climate change.The price tag for this massive expansion of government is enormous. Much of the attention in recent weeks has been focused on Warren’s embrace of Medicare for All, which she refuses to admit would require an increase in middle-class taxes. Even Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has conceded that such proposals, which would cost $30–40 trillion over 10 years, cannot be financed without tax hikes. Warren’s refusal to address this obvious fact makes her look less like a would-be policy wonk and more like a typical politician.But even setting aside Medicare for All, Warren’s plans are likely to dump oceans of red ink onto our growing national debt. Her non-health-care spending proposals already total some $7.5 trillion per year over the next 10 years. Although these are not quite Bernie levels of government largesse, her proposals would still require nearly double our current levels of spending.To pay for all this, Warren proposes a variety of tax hikes, mostly designed to hit corporations or high-earners: higher payroll taxes for those earning more than $250,000 per year; a 7 percent profits tax on companies earning more than $100 million; a 60 percent lobbying tax on firms that spend a million or more on lobbying, and so forth. But the biggest chunk of money would come from Warren’s proposed “wealth tax,” a 2 to 3 percent levy on net worth above $50 million. Warren estimates that this wealth tax will pull in more than $2.75 trillion over ten years. It won’t.First, there is the slight problem that a wealth tax is probably unconstitutional. Of course, constitutional constraints are quaint notions in the Age of Trump. Regardless, it is worth noting that the Constitution permits the federal government to impose only “direct taxes,” such as a property tax. That’s why it required a constitutional amendment to enact the federal income tax. Many constitutional scholars warn that a wealth tax is neither a direct tax nor income tax.Even if Warren can find a way around the constitutional guardrails -- perhaps by something such as a retrospective wealth tax in which you wait until a taxpayer sells assets or passes away -- a wealth tax is unlikely to raise anywhere near the amount of money she predicts.Simply look at Europe’s experiments with wealth taxes. At one time, a dozen European countries imposed wealth taxes. Today, all but three have abandoned those levies. Among those repealing their wealth tax are the Scandinavian social democracies that Warren admires, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Norway retains a wealth tax but has significantly reduced it in recent years. Additional countries abandoning the tax include Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Other countries, such as Great Britain, have considered wealth taxes and rejected them.They did so because wealth taxes are administratively complex and difficult to enforce. Also, they significantly reduce investment, entrepreneurship, and, ultimately, economic growth. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, European wealth taxes raised, on average, only about 0.2 percent of GDP in revenues. By comparison, the U.S. federal income tax raises 8 percent of GDP.Two groups, however, would benefit substantially from a wealth tax. The tax would be a full-employment opportunity for the tax-preparation industry and for lawyers. After all, we would now have to determine fair market value for everything from homes and vehicles to artwork and jewelry to family pension rights and intellectual property.

She said the project would feature a museum, library, gym, and forum.“Barack and I wouldn’t bring some crap up in our neighborhood,” she reportedly said.

Meghan McCain Spars With Cory Booker Over Civility: Beto Was ‘Very Nasty’ to Me!,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:39:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/meghan-mccain-spars-cory-booker-163901660.html,"During a Wednesday interview with Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, The View’s Meghan McCain did what she apparently does best: Make the conversation about herself and, in this case, her personal beef with a presidential hopeful.After applauding Booker for saying Medicare for All is unrealistic, the conservative View co-host took issue with the New Jersey senator’s support for mandatory gun buybacks. This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he’s going to take her brother’s guns.After a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they’d continue the conversation in the next segment.“No we’re not,” McCain grumbled. “It’s fine.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

"Former &lt;/&gt;Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:11:25 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/former-time-editor-wants-hate-211125098.html,"A former Time editor claimed that the United States needs a law banning hate speech, and that President Donald Trump “might be in violation of it” if there were one -- because, apparently, he doesn’t notice the irony of holding both of these views at once.In a Tuesday tweet promoting his Washington Post piece, titled “Why America needs a hate speech law,” Richard Stengel stated:> My @WashingtonPost piece on why the very broadness of the First Amendment suggests we should have a hate speech law. And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f> > -- Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019In the piece, Stengel writes that “many nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred” in the wake of World War II:> These laws started out as protections against the kinds of anti-Semitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws, but there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general, hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.“I’m all for protecting ‘thought that we hate,’ but not speech that incites hate,” he continues. “It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.”It’s interesting how Stengel actually does acknowledge the fact that “there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is,” and yet he still wants laws banning it. This makes absolutely no sense. After all, when he calls for laws to ban “hate speech,” he is, inherently, giving the government the power to decide what would and would not qualify -- the exact same government that is led by Donald Trump, and that is full of people who support him.In other words: Stengel somehow trusts that the government will have the same view of “hate speech” as he does, and then, in the same thought, seems to acknowledge that there’s actually no way that many of them would. Unless he thinks that the president and his congressional supporters would actually pass a law that they’d be in violation of, his argument for “hate speech” laws winds up being a pretty great argument against them.It’s ironic, but it’s not new: More often than not, it’s the uber-progressives arguing for laws against “hate speech” -- despite the fact that they’re often the same people who are also arguing that Donald Trump and Republicans are constantly spewing it. Maybe it’s just me, but if I thought that the leader of my government was, you know, literally Hitler or whatever, the last thing that I’d want would be to give that person and their supporters control over my speech.Yes, the First Amendment gives us the right to be “offensive” with our speech. Given the fact that a new thing seems to be declared “racist” or “sexist” every day, I’m certainly glad that we do have this protection. After all, it would only take there being a few too many of the “super woke” in our government for a phrase like “you guys” to become a criminal offense.The truth is, though, the right to be “offensive” (however you define that subjective term, anyway) is not even the most important role that our First Amendment plays. No, what’s most important is that it protects our right to speak out against the government when we see fit -- without having to worry about its retaliation. Like it or not, the only way to ensure that we retain this important check on government power is to never (ever) give its leaders a vehicle take it away.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eTNessteMBpuBTcqmJGuYw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/bae9af12e23cce197b317b5c1be56053,"Former </>Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony"

She's just not a fan of the .002 cents each American taxpayer essentially spent last year on federal ""mascots,"" as well as the several thousand more dollars it put toward various trinkets, and is proposing a bill to end it all.Ernst unveiled her SWAG Act, which stands for Stop Wasteful Advertising by the Government, on Tuesday, which would block federal agencies from creating mascots unless it's done via statute. Smokey Bear and Woodsy Owl, for example, would be safe, but Sammy Soil, a literal chunk of soil with eyes created by the USDA's conservation branch, would be rooted out. So would Franklin the Fair Housing Fox, The Green Reaper, and some other mascots Ernst says have been known to make babies cry.A variety of knickknacks are also targeted under Ernst's proposal to ""Bag the Swag:"" the $605,000 spent on coloring books last year; $33,000 on Snuggies; $17,000 on drink koozies; and $16,000 on fidget spinners. Ernst would also ""prohibit the purchase and distribution of 'swag'"" like these, unless they're also authorized by statute, per Ernst's press release.Overall, the federal government spent a total of $250,000 on the mascots last year. The Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, which Ernst voted to enact, is meanwhile expected to cost at least $1.5 trillion.",,"The U.S. government spent $16,000 on fidget spinners last year, and GOP Sen.

"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:17:36 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/record-wave-lone-child-migrants-122133758.html,"TENOSIQUE, Mexico -- The United States has detained more children trying to cross the nation's southwest border on their own over the last year than during any other period on record, surpassing the surge of unaccompanied minors that set off a crisis during the Obama administration, according to new figures released Tuesday.U.S. immigration authorities apprehended 76,020 minors, most of them from Central America, traveling without their parents in the fiscal year that ended in September -- 52% more than during the last fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Mexico is experiencing the same surge. Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period -- pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.In interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous -- and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.""These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,"" Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters. ""And each month during the fiscal year, the numbers increased. You saw them. We all saw them.""The young migrants came alongside a historic wave of families traveling together, also largely from Central America. They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.Marvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced -- and he pressed on.""Quitting was not an option,"" Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. ""You wipe your tears and carry on.""For the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they'd kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.His parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said. ""We can't bear losing another son,"" they told him. ""You have to go.""He left home in the spring, with $40 in his pocket and no plan except to find work in a safer place.As for most underage migrants traveling without their parents, his trip north has been a feat of improvisation and courage. He walked and hitchhiked through Honduras and Guatemala. He slept in churches, under trees or wherever he found himself when night fell.Along the way, he gathered crucial bits of information from fellow migrants: the best route to take, locations of shelters up ahead, places to avoid, where to forage for food.As huge numbers of young migrants from Central America began arriving at the United States' southern border in 2014, the Obama administration scrambled to house them until they could be released to sponsors -- adults who applied to care for them. The shelter system grew dramatically as a result.The Trump administration experienced similar backups at the border just a few years later -- this time because of new, more stringent policies that made the sponsors themselves, who are often undocumented, vulnerable to immigration authorities. This discouraged people from coming forward, leaving thousands of children to languish in the system.The Trump administration has also sought to deter migration by separating thousands of children from their relatives, again driving up the number of children in federally contracted shelters.On the road, while trying to avoid detention, fear and hunger are constant companions for many young migrants.With little or no money in their pockets, they relied on strangers for snacks or meals. They pawed through garbage and scanned drifts of debris on the roadside, hoping to spot an edible morsel.Wilson, a 17-year-old Honduran, said he had feasted on rotten mangos discarded by street vendors.""I used to drink water from potholes when I was too thirsty,"" interjected Mario Leonel, 16, who left home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, several weeks ago without notifying his parents. ""That is the hardest part of it all: the hunger.""When he arrived at the shelter in Tenosique, a small Mexican town near the Guatemala border, he called his parents in Honduras, who burst into tears and pleaded for him to return. He said no. He was tired of all the violence in his country, and wanted to get asylum in the United States.After Marvel slipped across the Guatemala-Mexico border in May, he found room at a shelter in Tenosique, which serves as a transit point for many migrants. He quickly made new friends among other teenage migrants who had made it this far, mainly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador.On a recent afternoon, several of them gathered in a two-story building that had been reserved for minors, its walls painted with colorful animal murals. The boys cracked jokes, roughhoused and argued about who was the cutest girl in the shelter.Outside, Dulce, a 16-year-old transgender migrant from Guatemala, sat alone on train tracks pining for a boy she had met at the shelter. He had left without explanation and she was lovesick.""I just can't get him out of my mind,"" she said.She left her hometown four months earlier to escape abuse from her family and strangers, including a sexual assault by gang members when she was 12. She made it as far as central Mexico before being detained and deported. Five days after returning home, she set off again.""I left because I had nothing there and no one to protect me,"" she said. ""At least here I am safe.""Though the United States remains the destination of choice for most unaccompanied minors, an increasing number are setting their sights no farther than Mexico, advocates and migrants say.Sometimes they have no choice: Mexico's increased enforcement measures have made it more difficult for migrants to make it to the border with the United States. And even if they reach the United States, recent policies have drastically lowered the possibilities of getting asylum.In Mexico, when unaccompanied minors are detained, the law mandates that they be released right away into the custody of the national child protection agency, which finds them accommodation in shelters designed for children.But migrants' advocates say the government has been holding children in the nation's overcrowded detention centers for far too long, and that some children are quickly funneled into the deportation process rather than being given a fair chance to seek asylum or some other form of relief.""No child should ever be held at a detention center,"" said Elba Coria, a migration expert from the Clinic for Refugees at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City. ""But while international standards consider children's detention as an exceptional measure, amid Mexico's migration chaos, it is the rule.""Neither Marvel nor any of his new friends in the Tenosique shelter had been detained by the authorities. All had managed to cross into Mexico from Guatemala and had applied for asylum in Mexico after talking through their options with the shelter staff.They now plan to remain in Mexico and look for work and study opportunities -- even if they haven't abandoned hope of making it to the United States.""It is every Honduran's boy dream to get to the United States, where there is more money and kids are able to go to school,"" said Jose Angel, 17. He was born with a disability that left him unable to use his arms and left his hometown because his grandmother could no longer take care of him.He was hopeful he could apply for asylum in the United States despite Trump's many efforts to severely lower the number of people granted asylum. ""It is scary, but you have to take a chance,"" he said.On a recent morning, Alan, a 17-year-old Guatemalan migrant, sat on the sidewalk outside a migrant shelter in the city of Palenque, in southern Mexico. He had just crossed the border and was exhausted. Mexican immigration officials had stopped a bus he was on, but he managed to escape into the countryside and hide.Alan planned to take a nap, shower and have a meal before trying illegally to board a freight train known as The Beast. It runs from Mexico's border with Guatemala to its border with the United States and, for decades, migrants have clung to it to speed through much of Mexico.His hope was to make it to the U.S. border and petition for asylum. He was undeterred by Trump's recent efforts to restrict asylum claims or curb immigration.""One way or another, I have to make it to the other side where there are skyscrapers and life is better,"" he said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5ol82jExNHqBHa7IGzz2mw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/03f35d3f9d537a8dc9fe503d06c098de,"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation"

Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 10:05:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-warren-untenable-plans-140521979.html,"If you’ve been having trouble finding someone to walk your dog, don’t worry. Any day now, Elizabeth Warren will announce “a plan for that.” It will undoubtedly be comprehensive, detailed, and replete with subsidies for lower- and middle-class dog walkers and underserved breeds. It will cost tens of billions of dollars and will receive widespread positive notice from the media. However, to judge by her other recent plans, the one thing it won’t include is any discussion of how she plans to pay for it.The Massachusetts senator has challenged and possibly overtaken former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, largely based on having a plan for the government to tackle every problem facing this country, no matter how big or how small, from issues with military housing to Puerto Rican debt to climate change.The price tag for this massive expansion of government is enormous. Much of the attention in recent weeks has been focused on Warren’s embrace of Medicare for All, which she refuses to admit would require an increase in middle-class taxes. Even Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has conceded that such proposals, which would cost $30–40 trillion over 10 years, cannot be financed without tax hikes. Warren’s refusal to address this obvious fact makes her look less like a would-be policy wonk and more like a typical politician.But even setting aside Medicare for All, Warren’s plans are likely to dump oceans of red ink onto our growing national debt. Her non-health-care spending proposals already total some $7.5 trillion per year over the next 10 years. Although these are not quite Bernie levels of government largesse, her proposals would still require nearly double our current levels of spending.To pay for all this, Warren proposes a variety of tax hikes, mostly designed to hit corporations or high-earners: higher payroll taxes for those earning more than $250,000 per year; a 7 percent profits tax on companies earning more than $100 million; a 60 percent lobbying tax on firms that spend a million or more on lobbying, and so forth. But the biggest chunk of money would come from Warren’s proposed “wealth tax,” a 2 to 3 percent levy on net worth above $50 million. Warren estimates that this wealth tax will pull in more than $2.75 trillion over ten years. It won’t.First, there is the slight problem that a wealth tax is probably unconstitutional. Of course, constitutional constraints are quaint notions in the Age of Trump. Regardless, it is worth noting that the Constitution permits the federal government to impose only “direct taxes,” such as a property tax. That’s why it required a constitutional amendment to enact the federal income tax. Many constitutional scholars warn that a wealth tax is neither a direct tax nor income tax.Even if Warren can find a way around the constitutional guardrails -- perhaps by something such as a retrospective wealth tax in which you wait until a taxpayer sells assets or passes away -- a wealth tax is unlikely to raise anywhere near the amount of money she predicts.Simply look at Europe’s experiments with wealth taxes. At one time, a dozen European countries imposed wealth taxes. Today, all but three have abandoned those levies. Among those repealing their wealth tax are the Scandinavian social democracies that Warren admires, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Norway retains a wealth tax but has significantly reduced it in recent years. Additional countries abandoning the tax include Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Other countries, such as Great Britain, have considered wealth taxes and rejected them.They did so because wealth taxes are administratively complex and difficult to enforce. Also, they significantly reduce investment, entrepreneurship, and, ultimately, economic growth. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, European wealth taxes raised, on average, only about 0.2 percent of GDP in revenues. By comparison, the U.S. federal income tax raises 8 percent of GDP.Two groups, however, would benefit substantially from a wealth tax. The tax would be a full-employment opportunity for the tax-preparation industry and for lawyers. After all, we would now have to determine fair market value for everything from homes and vehicles to artwork and jewelry to family pension rights and intellectual property. The other big winner would be lobbyists, who could be expected to descend on Washington en masse seeking exemptions and exceptions for their clients. If you think the tax code is a mess today, just wait until D.C. is done with Warren’s plan.There is an old Yiddish proverb that goes “Mann tracht, un Gott Lacht,” or “Man plans, and God laughs.” It is all well and good that Senator Warren has a plan for everything. But until she actually figures out how to pay for everything without crippling our economy, such plans really don’t add up.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/t_XOfhQ2Q8pn0Eihbaza4g--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/710b4188b8e44ebd02c332c03dfb8d66,Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans

Meghan McCain Spars With Cory Booker Over Civility: Beto Was ‘Very Nasty’ to Me!,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:39:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/meghan-mccain-spars-cory-booker-163901660.html,"During a Wednesday interview with Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, The View’s Meghan McCain did what she apparently does best: Make the conversation about herself and, in this case, her personal beef with a presidential hopeful.After applauding Booker for saying Medicare for All is unrealistic, the conservative View co-host took issue with the New Jersey senator’s support for mandatory gun buybacks. This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he’s going to take her brother’s guns.After a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they’d continue the conversation in the next segment.“No we’re not,” McCain grumbled. “It’s fine.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Dem Rep Claims Trump’s Immigration Policy Reflects a ‘White Supremacist Ideology’ While Grilling USCIS Chief,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 14:33:29 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/dem-rep-claims-trump-immigration-183329201.html,"Florida Democratic Rep.

A staffer sitting behind her was captured on video as her eyes widened in shock.""You have demonstrated that you will pursue this heinous white supremacist ideology at all costs,"" said Wasserman Schultz. Cuccinelli answered that neither he nor the President was a white supremacist.""That's false,"" Cuccinelli said, calling Wasserman Schultz's statements ""defamatory.""Cuccinelli had been summoned to the hearing to discuss the Trump administration's decision to temporarily stop granting deportation deferments for illegal aliens receiving life-saving treatment in the U.S.Representative Ayanna Pressley (D., Ohio) also entered into a heated exchange with Cuccinelli over who was responsible for the decision, himself or White House officials.

"Former &lt;/&gt;Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:11:25 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/former-time-editor-wants-hate-211125098.html,"A former Time editor claimed that the United States needs a law banning hate speech, and that President Donald Trump “might be in violation of it” if there were one -- because, apparently, he doesn’t notice the irony of holding both of these views at once.In a Tuesday tweet promoting his Washington Post piece, titled “Why America needs a hate speech law,” Richard Stengel stated:> My @WashingtonPost piece on why the very broadness of the First Amendment suggests we should have a hate speech law. And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f> > -- Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019In the piece, Stengel writes that “many nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred” in the wake of World War II:> These laws started out as protections against the kinds of anti-Semitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws, but there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general, hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.“I’m all for protecting ‘thought that we hate,’ but not speech that incites hate,” he continues. “It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.”It’s interesting how Stengel actually does acknowledge the fact that “there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is,” and yet he still wants laws banning it. This makes absolutely no sense. After all, when he calls for laws to ban “hate speech,” he is, inherently, giving the government the power to decide what would and would not qualify -- the exact same government that is led by Donald Trump, and that is full of people who support him.In other words: Stengel somehow trusts that the government will have the same view of “hate speech” as he does, and then, in the same thought, seems to acknowledge that there’s actually no way that many of them would. Unless he thinks that the president and his congressional supporters would actually pass a law that they’d be in violation of, his argument for “hate speech” laws winds up being a pretty great argument against them.It’s ironic, but it’s not new: More often than not, it’s the uber-progressives arguing for laws against “hate speech” -- despite the fact that they’re often the same people who are also arguing that Donald Trump and Republicans are constantly spewing it. Maybe it’s just me, but if I thought that the leader of my government was, you know, literally Hitler or whatever, the last thing that I’d want would be to give that person and their supporters control over my speech.Yes, the First Amendment gives us the right to be “offensive” with our speech. Given the fact that a new thing seems to be declared “racist” or “sexist” every day, I’m certainly glad that we do have this protection. After all, it would only take there being a few too many of the “super woke” in our government for a phrase like “you guys” to become a criminal offense.The truth is, though, the right to be “offensive” (however you define that subjective term, anyway) is not even the most important role that our First Amendment plays. No, what’s most important is that it protects our right to speak out against the government when we see fit -- without having to worry about its retaliation. Like it or not, the only way to ensure that we retain this important check on government power is to never (ever) give its leaders a vehicle take it away.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eTNessteMBpuBTcqmJGuYw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/bae9af12e23cce197b317b5c1be56053,"Former </>Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony"

Smokey Bear and Woodsy Owl, for example, would be safe, but Sammy Soil, a literal chunk of soil with eyes created by the USDA's conservation branch, would be rooted out. So would Franklin the Fair Housing Fox, The Green Reaper, and some other mascots Ernst says have been known to make babies cry.A variety of knickknacks are also targeted under Ernst's proposal to ""Bag the Swag:"" the $605,000 spent on coloring books last year; $33,000 on Snuggies; $17,000 on drink koozies; and $16,000 on fidget spinners. Ernst would also ""prohibit the purchase and distribution of 'swag'"" like these, unless they're also authorized by statute, per Ernst's press release.Overall, the federal government spent a total of $250,000 on the mascots last year.

Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period -- pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.In interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous -- and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.""These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,"" Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters. ""And each month during the fiscal year, the numbers increased. You saw them. We all saw them.""The young migrants came alongside a historic wave of families traveling together, also largely from Central America. They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.Marvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced -- and he pressed on.""Quitting was not an option,"" Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. ""You wipe your tears and carry on.""For the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they'd kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.His parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said. ""We can't bear losing another son,"" they told him. ""You have to go.""He left home in the spring, with $40 in his pocket and no plan except to find work in a safer place.As for most underage migrants traveling without their parents, his trip north has been a feat of improvisation and courage. He walked and hitchhiked through Honduras and Guatemala. He slept in churches, under trees or wherever he found himself when night fell.Along the way, he gathered crucial bits of information from fellow migrants: the best route to take, locations of shelters up ahead, places to avoid, where to forage for food.As huge numbers of young migrants from Central America began arriving at the United States' southern border in 2014, the Obama administration scrambled to house them until they could be released to sponsors -- adults who applied to care for them. The shelter system grew dramatically as a result.The Trump administration experienced similar backups at the border just a few years later -- this time because of new, more stringent policies that made the sponsors themselves, who are often undocumented, vulnerable to immigration authorities. This discouraged people from coming forward, leaving thousands of children to languish in the system.The Trump administration has also sought to deter migration by separating thousands of children from their relatives, again driving up the number of children in federally contracted shelters.On the road, while trying to avoid detention, fear and hunger are constant companions for many young migrants.With little or no money in their pockets, they relied on strangers for snacks or meals. They pawed through garbage and scanned drifts of debris on the roadside, hoping to spot an edible morsel.Wilson, a 17-year-old Honduran, said he had feasted on rotten mangos discarded by street vendors.""I used to drink water from potholes when I was too thirsty,"" interjected Mario Leonel, 16, who left home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, several weeks ago without notifying his parents. ""That is the hardest part of it all: the hunger.""When he arrived at the shelter in Tenosique, a small Mexican town near the Guatemala border, he called his parents in Honduras, who burst into tears and pleaded for him to return. He said no. He was tired of all the violence in his country, and wanted to get asylum in the United States.After Marvel slipped across the Guatemala-Mexico border in May, he found room at a shelter in Tenosique, which serves as a transit point for many migrants. He quickly made new friends among other teenage migrants who had made it this far, mainly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador.On a recent afternoon, several of them gathered in a two-story building that had been reserved for minors, its walls painted with colorful animal murals. The boys cracked jokes, roughhoused and argued about who was the cutest girl in the shelter.Outside, Dulce, a 16-year-old transgender migrant from Guatemala, sat alone on train tracks pining for a boy she had met at the shelter. He had left without explanation and she was lovesick.""I just can't get him out of my mind,"" she said.She left her hometown four months earlier to escape abuse from her family and strangers, including a sexual assault by gang members when she was 12. She made it as far as central Mexico before being detained and deported. Five days after returning home, she set off again.""I left because I had nothing there and no one to protect me,"" she said. ""At least here I am safe.""Though the United States remains the destination of choice for most unaccompanied minors, an increasing number are setting their sights no farther than Mexico, advocates and migrants say.Sometimes they have no choice: Mexico's increased enforcement measures have made it more difficult for migrants to make it to the border with the United States. And even if they reach the United States, recent policies have drastically lowered the possibilities of getting asylum.In Mexico, when unaccompanied minors are detained, the law mandates that they be released right away into the custody of the national child protection agency, which finds them accommodation in shelters designed for children.But migrants' advocates say the government has been holding children in the nation's overcrowded detention centers for far too long, and that some children are quickly funneled into the deportation process rather than being given a fair chance to seek asylum or some other form of relief.""No child should ever be held at a detention center,"" said Elba Coria, a migration expert from the Clinic for Refugees at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City. ""But while international standards consider children's detention as an exceptional measure, amid Mexico's migration chaos, it is the rule.""Neither Marvel nor any of his new friends in the Tenosique shelter had been detained by the authorities. All had managed to cross into Mexico from Guatemala and had applied for asylum in Mexico after talking through their options with the shelter staff.They now plan to remain in Mexico and look for work and study opportunities -- even if they haven't abandoned hope of making it to the United States.""It is every Honduran's boy dream to get to the United States, where there is more money and kids are able to go to school,"" said Jose Angel, 17. He was born with a disability that left him unable to use his arms and left his hometown because his grandmother could no longer take care of him.He was hopeful he could apply for asylum in the United States despite Trump's many efforts to severely lower the number of people granted asylum. ""It is scary, but you have to take a chance,"" he said.On a recent morning, Alan, a 17-year-old Guatemalan migrant, sat on the sidewalk outside a migrant shelter in the city of Palenque, in southern Mexico. He had just crossed the border and was exhausted. Mexican immigration officials had stopped a bus he was on, but he managed to escape into the countryside and hide.Alan planned to take a nap, shower and have a meal before trying illegally to board a freight train known as The Beast. It runs from Mexico's border with Guatemala to its border with the United States and, for decades, migrants have clung to it to speed through much of Mexico.His hope was to make it to the U.S. border and petition for asylum. He was undeterred by Trump's recent efforts to restrict asylum claims or curb immigration.""One way or another, I have to make it to the other side where there are skyscrapers and life is better,"" he said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5ol82jExNHqBHa7IGzz2mw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/03f35d3f9d537a8dc9fe503d06c098de,"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation"

Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 10:05:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-warren-untenable-plans-140521979.html,"If you’ve been having trouble finding someone to walk your dog, don’t worry. Any day now, Elizabeth Warren will announce “a plan for that.” It will undoubtedly be comprehensive, detailed, and replete with subsidies for lower- and middle-class dog walkers and underserved breeds. It will cost tens of billions of dollars and will receive widespread positive notice from the media. However, to judge by her other recent plans, the one thing it won’t include is any discussion of how she plans to pay for it.The Massachusetts senator has challenged and possibly overtaken former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, largely based on having a plan for the government to tackle every problem facing this country, no matter how big or how small, from issues with military housing to Puerto Rican debt to climate change.The price tag for this massive expansion of government is enormous. Much of the attention in recent weeks has been focused on Warren’s embrace of Medicare for All, which she refuses to admit would require an increase in middle-class taxes. Even Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has conceded that such proposals, which would cost $30–40 trillion over 10 years, cannot be financed without tax hikes. Warren’s refusal to address this obvious fact makes her look less like a would-be policy wonk and more like a typical politician.But even setting aside Medicare for All, Warren’s plans are likely to dump oceans of red ink onto our growing national debt. Her non-health-care spending proposals already total some $7.5 trillion per year over the next 10 years. Although these are not quite Bernie levels of government largesse, her proposals would still require nearly double our current levels of spending.To pay for all this, Warren proposes a variety of tax hikes, mostly designed to hit corporations or high-earners: higher payroll taxes for those earning more than $250,000 per year; a 7 percent profits tax on companies earning more than $100 million; a 60 percent lobbying tax on firms that spend a million or more on lobbying, and so forth. But the biggest chunk of money would come from Warren’s proposed “wealth tax,” a 2 to 3 percent levy on net worth above $50 million. Warren estimates that this wealth tax will pull in more than $2.75 trillion over ten years. It won’t.First, there is the slight problem that a wealth tax is probably unconstitutional. Of course, constitutional constraints are quaint notions in the Age of Trump. Regardless, it is worth noting that the Constitution permits the federal government to impose only “direct taxes,” such as a property tax. That’s why it required a constitutional amendment to enact the federal income tax. Many constitutional scholars warn that a wealth tax is neither a direct tax nor income tax.Even if Warren can find a way around the constitutional guardrails -- perhaps by something such as a retrospective wealth tax in which you wait until a taxpayer sells assets or passes away -- a wealth tax is unlikely to raise anywhere near the amount of money she predicts.Simply look at Europe’s experiments with wealth taxes. At one time, a dozen European countries imposed wealth taxes. Today, all but three have abandoned those levies. Among those repealing their wealth tax are the Scandinavian social democracies that Warren admires, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Norway retains a wealth tax but has significantly reduced it in recent years. Additional countries abandoning the tax include Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Other countries, such as Great Britain, have considered wealth taxes and rejected them.They did so because wealth taxes are administratively complex and difficult to enforce. Also, they significantly reduce investment, entrepreneurship, and, ultimately, economic growth. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, European wealth taxes raised, on average, only about 0.2 percent of GDP in revenues. By comparison, the U.S. federal income tax raises 8 percent of GDP.Two groups, however, would benefit substantially from a wealth tax. The tax would be a full-employment opportunity for the tax-preparation industry and for lawyers. After all, we would now have to determine fair market value for everything from homes and vehicles to artwork and jewelry to family pension rights and intellectual property. The other big winner would be lobbyists, who could be expected to descend on Washington en masse seeking exemptions and exceptions for their clients. If you think the tax code is a mess today, just wait until D.C. is done with Warren’s plan.There is an old Yiddish proverb that goes “Mann tracht, un Gott Lacht,” or “Man plans, and God laughs.” It is all well and good that Senator Warren has a plan for everything. But until she actually figures out how to pay for everything without crippling our economy, such plans really don’t add up.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/t_XOfhQ2Q8pn0Eihbaza4g--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/710b4188b8e44ebd02c332c03dfb8d66,Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans

Meghan McCain Spars With Cory Booker Over Civility: Beto Was ‘Very Nasty’ to Me!,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:39:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/meghan-mccain-spars-cory-booker-163901660.html,"During a Wednesday interview with Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, The View’s Meghan McCain did what she apparently does best: Make the conversation about herself and, in this case, her personal beef with a presidential hopeful.After applauding Booker for saying Medicare for All is unrealistic, the conservative View co-host took issue with the New Jersey senator’s support for mandatory gun buybacks. This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he’s going to take her brother’s guns.After a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they’d continue the conversation in the next segment.“No we’re not,” McCain grumbled. “It’s fine.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

A staffer sitting behind her was captured on video as her eyes widened in shock.""You have demonstrated that you will pursue this heinous white supremacist ideology at all costs,"" said Wasserman Schultz.

These Are The Stocks to Watch as U.K. Heads to the Polls Again,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 04:38:28 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/stocks-watch-u-k-heads-083828793.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.K. is headed to the polls on Dec. 12, bringing banks, utilities and housebuilders into focus for U.K. equity investors. There’s also the small matter of Brexit, as strategists digest what the latest developments mean for sterling and U.K. assets.In the lead-up to the vote, “both Labour and the Conservatives are expected to come out with pretty punchy views on tax, innovation and public spending, which could have significant implications for both corporates and consumers,” Emma Wall, head of investment analysis at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown Plc, said by email.Banks, utilities, transport and and defense are the sectors with most at stake should there be a change in the balance of power, according to Caroline Simmons, deputy head of UBS Wealth Management’s U.K. Investment Office.Here’s what to watch as the poll looms.FTSE 100Given Labour had made taking no-deal out of the equation a prerequisite of supporting a general election, the risk of a no-deal Brexit has reduced, which is likely to support U.K. risk assets, according to Edward Park, deputy chief investment officer at wealth manager Brooks Macdonald Group Plc.Should parliament return in December with a mandate for the withdrawal deal brokered by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, “sterling will value the reduced no-deal threat and continue the rally seen in recent weeks,” Park said by email. If that proves the case, then the inverse relationship between the exporter-heavy FTSE 100 and the pound should mean the index underperforms, he said.BanksLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn becoming prime minister could be just as damaging to British banks’ profits as the U.K. crashing out of the European Union without a deal.According to Citigroup Inc. analyst Andrew Coombs, the biggest risk to the U.K. banking sector is snap elections, given the impact on sentiment attached to the possibility of a Labour victory. The party’s “business unfriendly” deficit-financed policies would likely lead to capital outflows from the U.K., he wrote.U.K. lenders Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Lloyds Banking Group Plc have gained 5.6% and 7.7%, respectively, this month as the risk of a no-deal exit reduced.Utilities and TransportShares of companies that keep Britons warm and bathed have been an excellent indicator of U.K. election risk ever since Labour first vowed to nationalize utilities a few years back. Top of this list are water and electricity utilities, covering the likes of United Utilities Group Plc, Severn Trent Plc, National Grid Plc and SSE Plc.“While fears of nationalization under Corbyn’s rule have remained subdued with lingering Brexit angst, a renewed Labour leadership campaign could weigh heavily on U.K. utilities,” said Andrew Coury, a strategist at Liberum Capital.But if the Conservatives are able to regain power in an election, this threat would evaporate and the underperformance of U.K. utilities to their European peers may be reversed. It could be a similar story for other stocks and sectors Labour is said to have targeted for nationalization, including postal-service operator Royal Mail Plc and the companies that run British transport services like FirstGroup Plc and Stagecoach Group Plc.HousebuildersThe U.K. still suffers from an imbalance between the demand for housing and the volume of new houses being built, so any party campaigning for government would likely have to address this as part of their policy platform.Liberum expects the housing market to slow in the run-up to the election, but that housebuilder shares may outperform should the Conservatives emerge victorious. It particularly favors smaller companies such as Bellway Plc and Galliford Try Plc, which it says should benefit from better risk appetite and which have more attractive valuations.DefenseCorbyn has been a vocal opponent of military intervention in the Middle East and has argued for the suspension of arms sales to Saudi Arabia. His anti-war stance could hurt defense suppliers such as BAE Systems Plc, according to Citi, which estimated Aug. 1 that the London-based firm’s stock could fall 20% if Labour came to power.The U.K.’s Dreadnought nuclear deterrent submarine program -- another of BAE’s projects -- would also be at risk, Citi analyst Charles Armitage wrote. The level of risk to Dreadnought would be reduced if Labour entered a coalition with the Liberal Democrats, he said. A pact with the Scottish National Party would leave both Dreadnought and the Saudi business vulnerable, Armitage added.RetailersIf an election can produce a clear winner and therefore some clarity on the way forward, that may prove positive for retailers as shoppers should be more confident to spend.However, if the ultimate outcome is a hung parliament, making passing legislation even more difficult, that would likely be negative for the sector.Also watch for any impact on companies that own Britain’s shops, particularly the already-battered mall owners Intu Properties Plc and Hammerson Plc. Though UBS analysts think Brexit is only one of the problems that the sub-sector faces.ConstructionU.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid used his first set piece event in the role in early September to lay out plans to spend more money on infrastructure. There have been no further details since then and Javid had to cancel his planned Budget announcement, but if this is revived it would be positive for construction contractors like Balfour Beatty Plc, Costain Group Plc and Keller Group Plc.To contact the reporters on this story: Joe Easton in London at jeaston7@bloomberg.net;Sam Unsted in London at sunsted@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Beth Mellor at bmellor@bloomberg.net, Paul JarvisFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",,These Are The Stocks to Watch as U.K. Heads to the Polls Again

"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:17:36 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/record-wave-lone-child-migrants-122133758.html,"TENOSIQUE, Mexico -- The United States has detained more children trying to cross the nation's southwest border on their own over the last year than during any other period on record, surpassing the surge of unaccompanied minors that set off a crisis during the Obama administration, according to new figures released Tuesday.U.S. immigration authorities apprehended 76,020 minors, most of them from Central America, traveling without their parents in the fiscal year that ended in September -- 52% more than during the last fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Mexico is experiencing the same surge. Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period -- pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.In interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous -- and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.""These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,"" Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters. ""And each month during the fiscal year, the numbers increased. You saw them. We all saw them.""The young migrants came alongside a historic wave of families traveling together, also largely from Central America. They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.Marvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced -- and he pressed on.""Quitting was not an option,"" Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. ""You wipe your tears and carry on.""For the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they'd kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.His parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said. ""We can't bear losing another son,"" they told him. ""You have to go.""He left home in the spring, with $40 in his pocket and no plan except to find work in a safer place.As for most underage migrants traveling without their parents, his trip north has been a feat of improvisation and courage. He walked and hitchhiked through Honduras and Guatemala. He slept in churches, under trees or wherever he found himself when night fell.Along the way, he gathered crucial bits of information from fellow migrants: the best route to take, locations of shelters up ahead, places to avoid, where to forage for food.As huge numbers of young migrants from Central America began arriving at the United States' southern border in 2014, the Obama administration scrambled to house them until they could be released to sponsors -- adults who applied to care for them. The shelter system grew dramatically as a result.The Trump administration experienced similar backups at the border just a few years later -- this time because of new, more stringent policies that made the sponsors themselves, who are often undocumented, vulnerable to immigration authorities. This discouraged people from coming forward, leaving thousands of children to languish in the system.The Trump administration has also sought to deter migration by separating thousands of children from their relatives, again driving up the number of children in federally contracted shelters.On the road, while trying to avoid detention, fear and hunger are constant companions for many young migrants.With little or no money in their pockets, they relied on strangers for snacks or meals. They pawed through garbage and scanned drifts of debris on the roadside, hoping to spot an edible morsel.Wilson, a 17-year-old Honduran, said he had feasted on rotten mangos discarded by street vendors.""I used to drink water from potholes when I was too thirsty,"" interjected Mario Leonel, 16, who left home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, several weeks ago without notifying his parents. ""That is the hardest part of it all: the hunger.""When he arrived at the shelter in Tenosique, a small Mexican town near the Guatemala border, he called his parents in Honduras, who burst into tears and pleaded for him to return. He said no. He was tired of all the violence in his country, and wanted to get asylum in the United States.After Marvel slipped across the Guatemala-Mexico border in May, he found room at a shelter in Tenosique, which serves as a transit point for many migrants. He quickly made new friends among other teenage migrants who had made it this far, mainly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador.On a recent afternoon, several of them gathered in a two-story building that had been reserved for minors, its walls painted with colorful animal murals. The boys cracked jokes, roughhoused and argued about who was the cutest girl in the shelter.Outside, Dulce, a 16-year-old transgender migrant from Guatemala, sat alone on train tracks pining for a boy she had met at the shelter. He had left without explanation and she was lovesick.""I just can't get him out of my mind,"" she said.She left her hometown four months earlier to escape abuse from her family and strangers, including a sexual assault by gang members when she was 12. She made it as far as central Mexico before being detained and deported. Five days after returning home, she set off again.""I left because I had nothing there and no one to protect me,"" she said. ""At least here I am safe.""Though the United States remains the destination of choice for most unaccompanied minors, an increasing number are setting their sights no farther than Mexico, advocates and migrants say.Sometimes they have no choice: Mexico's increased enforcement measures have made it more difficult for migrants to make it to the border with the United States. And even if they reach the United States, recent policies have drastically lowered the possibilities of getting asylum.In Mexico, when unaccompanied minors are detained, the law mandates that they be released right away into the custody of the national child protection agency, which finds them accommodation in shelters designed for children.But migrants' advocates say the government has been holding children in the nation's overcrowded detention centers for far too long, and that some children are quickly funneled into the deportation process rather than being given a fair chance to seek asylum or some other form of relief.""No child should ever be held at a detention center,"" said Elba Coria, a migration expert from the Clinic for Refugees at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City. ""But while international standards consider children's detention as an exceptional measure, amid Mexico's migration chaos, it is the rule.""Neither Marvel nor any of his new friends in the Tenosique shelter had been detained by the authorities. All had managed to cross into Mexico from Guatemala and had applied for asylum in Mexico after talking through their options with the shelter staff.They now plan to remain in Mexico and look for work and study opportunities -- even if they haven't abandoned hope of making it to the United States.""It is every Honduran's boy dream to get to the United States, where there is more money and kids are able to go to school,"" said Jose Angel, 17. He was born with a disability that left him unable to use his arms and left his hometown because his grandmother could no longer take care of him.He was hopeful he could apply for asylum in the United States despite Trump's many efforts to severely lower the number of people granted asylum. ""It is scary, but you have to take a chance,"" he said.On a recent morning, Alan, a 17-year-old Guatemalan migrant, sat on the sidewalk outside a migrant shelter in the city of Palenque, in southern Mexico. He had just crossed the border and was exhausted. Mexican immigration officials had stopped a bus he was on, but he managed to escape into the countryside and hide.Alan planned to take a nap, shower and have a meal before trying illegally to board a freight train known as The Beast. It runs from Mexico's border with Guatemala to its border with the United States and, for decades, migrants have clung to it to speed through much of Mexico.His hope was to make it to the U.S. border and petition for asylum. He was undeterred by Trump's recent efforts to restrict asylum claims or curb immigration.""One way or another, I have to make it to the other side where there are skyscrapers and life is better,"" he said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5ol82jExNHqBHa7IGzz2mw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/03f35d3f9d537a8dc9fe503d06c098de,"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation"

Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 10:05:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-warren-untenable-plans-140521979.html,"If you’ve been having trouble finding someone to walk your dog, don’t worry. Any day now, Elizabeth Warren will announce “a plan for that.” It will undoubtedly be comprehensive, detailed, and replete with subsidies for lower- and middle-class dog walkers and underserved breeds. It will cost tens of billions of dollars and will receive widespread positive notice from the media. However, to judge by her other recent plans, the one thing it won’t include is any discussion of how she plans to pay for it.The Massachusetts senator has challenged and possibly overtaken former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, largely based on having a plan for the government to tackle every problem facing this country, no matter how big or how small, from issues with military housing to Puerto Rican debt to climate change.The price tag for this massive expansion of government is enormous. Much of the attention in recent weeks has been focused on Warren’s embrace of Medicare for All, which she refuses to admit would require an increase in middle-class taxes. Even Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has conceded that such proposals, which would cost $30–40 trillion over 10 years, cannot be financed without tax hikes. Warren’s refusal to address this obvious fact makes her look less like a would-be policy wonk and more like a typical politician.But even setting aside Medicare for All, Warren’s plans are likely to dump oceans of red ink onto our growing national debt. Her non-health-care spending proposals already total some $7.5 trillion per year over the next 10 years. Although these are not quite Bernie levels of government largesse, her proposals would still require nearly double our current levels of spending.To pay for all this, Warren proposes a variety of tax hikes, mostly designed to hit corporations or high-earners: higher payroll taxes for those earning more than $250,000 per year; a 7 percent profits tax on companies earning more than $100 million; a 60 percent lobbying tax on firms that spend a million or more on lobbying, and so forth. But the biggest chunk of money would come from Warren’s proposed “wealth tax,” a 2 to 3 percent levy on net worth above $50 million. Warren estimates that this wealth tax will pull in more than $2.75 trillion over ten years. It won’t.First, there is the slight problem that a wealth tax is probably unconstitutional. Of course, constitutional constraints are quaint notions in the Age of Trump. Regardless, it is worth noting that the Constitution permits the federal government to impose only “direct taxes,” such as a property tax. That’s why it required a constitutional amendment to enact the federal income tax. Many constitutional scholars warn that a wealth tax is neither a direct tax nor income tax.Even if Warren can find a way around the constitutional guardrails -- perhaps by something such as a retrospective wealth tax in which you wait until a taxpayer sells assets or passes away -- a wealth tax is unlikely to raise anywhere near the amount of money she predicts.Simply look at Europe’s experiments with wealth taxes. At one time, a dozen European countries imposed wealth taxes. Today, all but three have abandoned those levies. Among those repealing their wealth tax are the Scandinavian social democracies that Warren admires, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Norway retains a wealth tax but has significantly reduced it in recent years. Additional countries abandoning the tax include Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Other countries, such as Great Britain, have considered wealth taxes and rejected them.They did so because wealth taxes are administratively complex and difficult to enforce. Also, they significantly reduce investment, entrepreneurship, and, ultimately, economic growth. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, European wealth taxes raised, on average, only about 0.2 percent of GDP in revenues. By comparison, the U.S. federal income tax raises 8 percent of GDP.Two groups, however, would benefit substantially from a wealth tax. The tax would be a full-employment opportunity for the tax-preparation industry and for lawyers. After all, we would now have to determine fair market value for everything from homes and vehicles to artwork and jewelry to family pension rights and intellectual property. The other big winner would be lobbyists, who could be expected to descend on Washington en masse seeking exemptions and exceptions for their clients. If you think the tax code is a mess today, just wait until D.C. is done with Warren’s plan.There is an old Yiddish proverb that goes “Mann tracht, un Gott Lacht,” or “Man plans, and God laughs.” It is all well and good that Senator Warren has a plan for everything. But until she actually figures out how to pay for everything without crippling our economy, such plans really don’t add up.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/t_XOfhQ2Q8pn0Eihbaza4g--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/710b4188b8e44ebd02c332c03dfb8d66,Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans

She said the project would feature a museum, library, gym, and forum.“Barack and I wouldn’t bring some crap up in our neighborhood,” she reportedly said. She pointed out that she hails from the area by birth and that her husband Barack comes from South Side by choice.During his speech at the forum, Barack Obama said: “We joke about it a little bit, like this is the mothership.”While they hope the center could anchor a potential economic revival in the area, there have been setbacks.Opponents of the project are pursuing a federal court appeal after losing a lawsuit.

Meghan McCain Spars With Cory Booker Over Civility: Beto Was ‘Very Nasty’ to Me!,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:39:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/meghan-mccain-spars-cory-booker-163901660.html,"During a Wednesday interview with Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, The View’s Meghan McCain did what she apparently does best: Make the conversation about herself and, in this case, her personal beef with a presidential hopeful.After applauding Booker for saying Medicare for All is unrealistic, the conservative View co-host took issue with the New Jersey senator’s support for mandatory gun buybacks. This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he’s going to take her brother’s guns.After a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they’d continue the conversation in the next segment.“No we’re not,” McCain grumbled. “It’s fine.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

"Former &lt;/&gt;Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:11:25 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/former-time-editor-wants-hate-211125098.html,"A former Time editor claimed that the United States needs a law banning hate speech, and that President Donald Trump “might be in violation of it” if there were one -- because, apparently, he doesn’t notice the irony of holding both of these views at once.In a Tuesday tweet promoting his Washington Post piece, titled “Why America needs a hate speech law,” Richard Stengel stated:> My @WashingtonPost piece on why the very broadness of the First Amendment suggests we should have a hate speech law. And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f> > -- Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019In the piece, Stengel writes that “many nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred” in the wake of World War II:> These laws started out as protections against the kinds of anti-Semitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws, but there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general, hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.“I’m all for protecting ‘thought that we hate,’ but not speech that incites hate,” he continues. “It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.”It’s interesting how Stengel actually does acknowledge the fact that “there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is,” and yet he still wants laws banning it. This makes absolutely no sense. After all, when he calls for laws to ban “hate speech,” he is, inherently, giving the government the power to decide what would and would not qualify -- the exact same government that is led by Donald Trump, and that is full of people who support him.In other words: Stengel somehow trusts that the government will have the same view of “hate speech” as he does, and then, in the same thought, seems to acknowledge that there’s actually no way that many of them would. Unless he thinks that the president and his congressional supporters would actually pass a law that they’d be in violation of, his argument for “hate speech” laws winds up being a pretty great argument against them.It’s ironic, but it’s not new: More often than not, it’s the uber-progressives arguing for laws against “hate speech” -- despite the fact that they’re often the same people who are also arguing that Donald Trump and Republicans are constantly spewing it. Maybe it’s just me, but if I thought that the leader of my government was, you know, literally Hitler or whatever, the last thing that I’d want would be to give that person and their supporters control over my speech.Yes, the First Amendment gives us the right to be “offensive” with our speech. Given the fact that a new thing seems to be declared “racist” or “sexist” every day, I’m certainly glad that we do have this protection. After all, it would only take there being a few too many of the “super woke” in our government for a phrase like “you guys” to become a criminal offense.The truth is, though, the right to be “offensive” (however you define that subjective term, anyway) is not even the most important role that our First Amendment plays. No, what’s most important is that it protects our right to speak out against the government when we see fit -- without having to worry about its retaliation. Like it or not, the only way to ensure that we retain this important check on government power is to never (ever) give its leaders a vehicle take it away.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eTNessteMBpuBTcqmJGuYw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/bae9af12e23cce197b317b5c1be56053,"Former </>Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony"

Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) wants to rob the federal government of what little fun it has left.Every year, the U.S. government spends more than $1.4 billion on its public relations and advertising efforts -- not that Ernst has a problem with all of that. She's just not a fan of the .002 cents each American taxpayer essentially spent last year on federal ""mascots,"" as well as the several thousand more dollars it put toward various trinkets, and is proposing a bill to end it all.Ernst unveiled her SWAG Act, which stands for Stop Wasteful Advertising by the Government, on Tuesday, which would block federal agencies from creating mascots unless it's done via statute. Smokey Bear and Woodsy Owl, for example, would be safe, but Sammy Soil, a literal chunk of soil with eyes created by the USDA's conservation branch, would be rooted out. So would Franklin the Fair Housing Fox, The Green Reaper, and some other mascots Ernst says have been known to make babies cry.A variety of knickknacks are also targeted under Ernst's proposal to ""Bag the Swag:"" the $605,000 spent on coloring books last year; $33,000 on Snuggies; $17,000 on drink koozies; and $16,000 on fidget spinners. Ernst would also ""prohibit the purchase and distribution of 'swag'"" like these, unless they're also authorized by statute, per Ernst's press release.Overall, the federal government spent a total of $250,000 on the mascots last year. The Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, which Ernst voted to enact, is meanwhile expected to cost at least $1.5 trillion.",,"The U.S. government spent $16,000 on fidget spinners last year, and GOP Sen.

"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:17:36 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/record-wave-lone-child-migrants-122133758.html,"TENOSIQUE, Mexico -- The United States has detained more children trying to cross the nation's southwest border on their own over the last year than during any other period on record, surpassing the surge of unaccompanied minors that set off a crisis during the Obama administration, according to new figures released Tuesday.U.S. immigration authorities apprehended 76,020 minors, most of them from Central America, traveling without their parents in the fiscal year that ended in September -- 52% more than during the last fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Mexico is experiencing the same surge. Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period -- pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.In interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous -- and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.""These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,"" Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters. ""And each month during the fiscal year, the numbers increased. You saw them. We all saw them.""The young migrants came alongside a historic wave of families traveling together, also largely from Central America. They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.Marvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced -- and he pressed on.""Quitting was not an option,"" Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. ""You wipe your tears and carry on.""For the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they'd kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.His parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said. ""We can't bear losing another son,"" they told him. ""You have to go.""He left home in the spring, with $40 in his pocket and no plan except to find work in a safer place.As for most underage migrants traveling without their parents, his trip north has been a feat of improvisation and courage. He walked and hitchhiked through Honduras and Guatemala. He slept in churches, under trees or wherever he found himself when night fell.Along the way, he gathered crucial bits of information from fellow migrants: the best route to take, locations of shelters up ahead, places to avoid, where to forage for food.As huge numbers of young migrants from Central America began arriving at the United States' southern border in 2014, the Obama administration scrambled to house them until they could be released to sponsors -- adults who applied to care for them. The shelter system grew dramatically as a result.The Trump administration experienced similar backups at the border just a few years later -- this time because of new, more stringent policies that made the sponsors themselves, who are often undocumented, vulnerable to immigration authorities. This discouraged people from coming forward, leaving thousands of children to languish in the system.The Trump administration has also sought to deter migration by separating thousands of children from their relatives, again driving up the number of children in federally contracted shelters.On the road, while trying to avoid detention, fear and hunger are constant companions for many young migrants.With little or no money in their pockets, they relied on strangers for snacks or meals. They pawed through garbage and scanned drifts of debris on the roadside, hoping to spot an edible morsel.Wilson, a 17-year-old Honduran, said he had feasted on rotten mangos discarded by street vendors.""I used to drink water from potholes when I was too thirsty,"" interjected Mario Leonel, 16, who left home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, several weeks ago without notifying his parents. ""That is the hardest part of it all: the hunger.""When he arrived at the shelter in Tenosique, a small Mexican town near the Guatemala border, he called his parents in Honduras, who burst into tears and pleaded for him to return. He said no. He was tired of all the violence in his country, and wanted to get asylum in the United States.After Marvel slipped across the Guatemala-Mexico border in May, he found room at a shelter in Tenosique, which serves as a transit point for many migrants. He quickly made new friends among other teenage migrants who had made it this far, mainly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador.On a recent afternoon, several of them gathered in a two-story building that had been reserved for minors, its walls painted with colorful animal murals. The boys cracked jokes, roughhoused and argued about who was the cutest girl in the shelter.Outside, Dulce, a 16-year-old transgender migrant from Guatemala, sat alone on train tracks pining for a boy she had met at the shelter. He had left without explanation and she was lovesick.""I just can't get him out of my mind,"" she said.She left her hometown four months earlier to escape abuse from her family and strangers, including a sexual assault by gang members when she was 12. She made it as far as central Mexico before being detained and deported. Five days after returning home, she set off again.""I left because I had nothing there and no one to protect me,"" she said. ""At least here I am safe.""Though the United States remains the destination of choice for most unaccompanied minors, an increasing number are setting their sights no farther than Mexico, advocates and migrants say.Sometimes they have no choice: Mexico's increased enforcement measures have made it more difficult for migrants to make it to the border with the United States. And even if they reach the United States, recent policies have drastically lowered the possibilities of getting asylum.In Mexico, when unaccompanied minors are detained, the law mandates that they be released right away into the custody of the national child protection agency, which finds them accommodation in shelters designed for children.But migrants' advocates say the government has been holding children in the nation's overcrowded detention centers for far too long, and that some children are quickly funneled into the deportation process rather than being given a fair chance to seek asylum or some other form of relief.""No child should ever be held at a detention center,"" said Elba Coria, a migration expert from the Clinic for Refugees at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City. ""But while international standards consider children's detention as an exceptional measure, amid Mexico's migration chaos, it is the rule.""Neither Marvel nor any of his new friends in the Tenosique shelter had been detained by the authorities. All had managed to cross into Mexico from Guatemala and had applied for asylum in Mexico after talking through their options with the shelter staff.They now plan to remain in Mexico and look for work and study opportunities -- even if they haven't abandoned hope of making it to the United States.""It is every Honduran's boy dream to get to the United States, where there is more money and kids are able to go to school,"" said Jose Angel, 17. He was born with a disability that left him unable to use his arms and left his hometown because his grandmother could no longer take care of him.He was hopeful he could apply for asylum in the United States despite Trump's many efforts to severely lower the number of people granted asylum. ""It is scary, but you have to take a chance,"" he said.On a recent morning, Alan, a 17-year-old Guatemalan migrant, sat on the sidewalk outside a migrant shelter in the city of Palenque, in southern Mexico. He had just crossed the border and was exhausted. Mexican immigration officials had stopped a bus he was on, but he managed to escape into the countryside and hide.Alan planned to take a nap, shower and have a meal before trying illegally to board a freight train known as The Beast. It runs from Mexico's border with Guatemala to its border with the United States and, for decades, migrants have clung to it to speed through much of Mexico.His hope was to make it to the U.S. border and petition for asylum. He was undeterred by Trump's recent efforts to restrict asylum claims or curb immigration.""One way or another, I have to make it to the other side where there are skyscrapers and life is better,"" he said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5ol82jExNHqBHa7IGzz2mw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/03f35d3f9d537a8dc9fe503d06c098de,"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation"

Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 10:05:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-warren-untenable-plans-140521979.html,"If you’ve been having trouble finding someone to walk your dog, don’t worry. Any day now, Elizabeth Warren will announce “a plan for that.” It will undoubtedly be comprehensive, detailed, and replete with subsidies for lower- and middle-class dog walkers and underserved breeds. It will cost tens of billions of dollars and will receive widespread positive notice from the media. However, to judge by her other recent plans, the one thing it won’t include is any discussion of how she plans to pay for it.The Massachusetts senator has challenged and possibly overtaken former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, largely based on having a plan for the government to tackle every problem facing this country, no matter how big or how small, from issues with military housing to Puerto Rican debt to climate change.The price tag for this massive expansion of government is enormous. Much of the attention in recent weeks has been focused on Warren’s embrace of Medicare for All, which she refuses to admit would require an increase in middle-class taxes. Even Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has conceded that such proposals, which would cost $30–40 trillion over 10 years, cannot be financed without tax hikes. Warren’s refusal to address this obvious fact makes her look less like a would-be policy wonk and more like a typical politician.But even setting aside Medicare for All, Warren’s plans are likely to dump oceans of red ink onto our growing national debt. Her non-health-care spending proposals already total some $7.5 trillion per year over the next 10 years. Although these are not quite Bernie levels of government largesse, her proposals would still require nearly double our current levels of spending.To pay for all this, Warren proposes a variety of tax hikes, mostly designed to hit corporations or high-earners: higher payroll taxes for those earning more than $250,000 per year; a 7 percent profits tax on companies earning more than $100 million; a 60 percent lobbying tax on firms that spend a million or more on lobbying, and so forth. But the biggest chunk of money would come from Warren’s proposed “wealth tax,” a 2 to 3 percent levy on net worth above $50 million. Warren estimates that this wealth tax will pull in more than $2.75 trillion over ten years. It won’t.First, there is the slight problem that a wealth tax is probably unconstitutional. Of course, constitutional constraints are quaint notions in the Age of Trump. Regardless, it is worth noting that the Constitution permits the federal government to impose only “direct taxes,” such as a property tax. That’s why it required a constitutional amendment to enact the federal income tax. Many constitutional scholars warn that a wealth tax is neither a direct tax nor income tax.Even if Warren can find a way around the constitutional guardrails -- perhaps by something such as a retrospective wealth tax in which you wait until a taxpayer sells assets or passes away -- a wealth tax is unlikely to raise anywhere near the amount of money she predicts.Simply look at Europe’s experiments with wealth taxes. At one time, a dozen European countries imposed wealth taxes. Today, all but three have abandoned those levies. Among those repealing their wealth tax are the Scandinavian social democracies that Warren admires, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Norway retains a wealth tax but has significantly reduced it in recent years. Additional countries abandoning the tax include Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Other countries, such as Great Britain, have considered wealth taxes and rejected them.They did so because wealth taxes are administratively complex and difficult to enforce. Also, they significantly reduce investment, entrepreneurship, and, ultimately, economic growth. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, European wealth taxes raised, on average, only about 0.2 percent of GDP in revenues. By comparison, the U.S. federal income tax raises 8 percent of GDP.Two groups, however, would benefit substantially from a wealth tax. The tax would be a full-employment opportunity for the tax-preparation industry and for lawyers. After all, we would now have to determine fair market value for everything from homes and vehicles to artwork and jewelry to family pension rights and intellectual property. The other big winner would be lobbyists, who could be expected to descend on Washington en masse seeking exemptions and exceptions for their clients. If you think the tax code is a mess today, just wait until D.C. is done with Warren’s plan.There is an old Yiddish proverb that goes “Mann tracht, un Gott Lacht,” or “Man plans, and God laughs.” It is all well and good that Senator Warren has a plan for everything. But until she actually figures out how to pay for everything without crippling our economy, such plans really don’t add up.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/t_XOfhQ2Q8pn0Eihbaza4g--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/710b4188b8e44ebd02c332c03dfb8d66,Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans

Meghan McCain Spars With Cory Booker Over Civility: Beto Was ‘Very Nasty’ to Me!,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:39:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/meghan-mccain-spars-cory-booker-163901660.html,"During a Wednesday interview with Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, The View’s Meghan McCain did what she apparently does best: Make the conversation about herself and, in this case, her personal beef with a presidential hopeful.After applauding Booker for saying Medicare for All is unrealistic, the conservative View co-host took issue with the New Jersey senator’s support for mandatory gun buybacks. This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he’s going to take her brother’s guns.After a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they’d continue the conversation in the next segment.“No we’re not,” McCain grumbled. “It’s fine.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

A staffer sitting behind her was captured on video as her eyes widened in shock.""You have demonstrated that you will pursue this heinous white supremacist ideology at all costs,"" said Wasserman Schultz.

These Are The Stocks to Watch as U.K. Heads to the Polls Again,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 04:38:28 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/stocks-watch-u-k-heads-083828793.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.K. is headed to the polls on Dec. 12, bringing banks, utilities and housebuilders into focus for U.K. equity investors. There’s also the small matter of Brexit, as strategists digest what the latest developments mean for sterling and U.K. assets.In the lead-up to the vote, “both Labour and the Conservatives are expected to come out with pretty punchy views on tax, innovation and public spending, which could have significant implications for both corporates and consumers,” Emma Wall, head of investment analysis at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown Plc, said by email.Banks, utilities, transport and and defense are the sectors with most at stake should there be a change in the balance of power, according to Caroline Simmons, deputy head of UBS Wealth Management’s U.K. Investment Office.Here’s what to watch as the poll looms.FTSE 100Given Labour had made taking no-deal out of the equation a prerequisite of supporting a general election, the risk of a no-deal Brexit has reduced, which is likely to support U.K. risk assets, according to Edward Park, deputy chief investment officer at wealth manager Brooks Macdonald Group Plc.Should parliament return in December with a mandate for the withdrawal deal brokered by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, “sterling will value the reduced no-deal threat and continue the rally seen in recent weeks,” Park said by email. If that proves the case, then the inverse relationship between the exporter-heavy FTSE 100 and the pound should mean the index underperforms, he said.BanksLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn becoming prime minister could be just as damaging to British banks’ profits as the U.K. crashing out of the European Union without a deal.According to Citigroup Inc. analyst Andrew Coombs, the biggest risk to the U.K. banking sector is snap elections, given the impact on sentiment attached to the possibility of a Labour victory. The party’s “business unfriendly” deficit-financed policies would likely lead to capital outflows from the U.K., he wrote.U.K. lenders Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Lloyds Banking Group Plc have gained 5.6% and 7.7%, respectively, this month as the risk of a no-deal exit reduced.Utilities and TransportShares of companies that keep Britons warm and bathed have been an excellent indicator of U.K. election risk ever since Labour first vowed to nationalize utilities a few years back. Top of this list are water and electricity utilities, covering the likes of United Utilities Group Plc, Severn Trent Plc, National Grid Plc and SSE Plc.“While fears of nationalization under Corbyn’s rule have remained subdued with lingering Brexit angst, a renewed Labour leadership campaign could weigh heavily on U.K. utilities,” said Andrew Coury, a strategist at Liberum Capital.But if the Conservatives are able to regain power in an election, this threat would evaporate and the underperformance of U.K. utilities to their European peers may be reversed. It could be a similar story for other stocks and sectors Labour is said to have targeted for nationalization, including postal-service operator Royal Mail Plc and the companies that run British transport services like FirstGroup Plc and Stagecoach Group Plc.HousebuildersThe U.K. still suffers from an imbalance between the demand for housing and the volume of new houses being built, so any party campaigning for government would likely have to address this as part of their policy platform.Liberum expects the housing market to slow in the run-up to the election, but that housebuilder shares may outperform should the Conservatives emerge victorious. It particularly favors smaller companies such as Bellway Plc and Galliford Try Plc, which it says should benefit from better risk appetite and which have more attractive valuations.DefenseCorbyn has been a vocal opponent of military intervention in the Middle East and has argued for the suspension of arms sales to Saudi Arabia. His anti-war stance could hurt defense suppliers such as BAE Systems Plc, according to Citi, which estimated Aug. 1 that the London-based firm’s stock could fall 20% if Labour came to power.The U.K.’s Dreadnought nuclear deterrent submarine program -- another of BAE’s projects -- would also be at risk, Citi analyst Charles Armitage wrote. The level of risk to Dreadnought would be reduced if Labour entered a coalition with the Liberal Democrats, he said. A pact with the Scottish National Party would leave both Dreadnought and the Saudi business vulnerable, Armitage added.RetailersIf an election can produce a clear winner and therefore some clarity on the way forward, that may prove positive for retailers as shoppers should be more confident to spend.However, if the ultimate outcome is a hung parliament, making passing legislation even more difficult, that would likely be negative for the sector.Also watch for any impact on companies that own Britain’s shops, particularly the already-battered mall owners Intu Properties Plc and Hammerson Plc. Though UBS analysts think Brexit is only one of the problems that the sub-sector faces.ConstructionU.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid used his first set piece event in the role in early September to lay out plans to spend more money on infrastructure. There have been no further details since then and Javid had to cancel his planned Budget announcement, but if this is revived it would be positive for construction contractors like Balfour Beatty Plc, Costain Group Plc and Keller Group Plc.To contact the reporters on this story: Joe Easton in London at jeaston7@bloomberg.net;Sam Unsted in London at sunsted@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Beth Mellor at bmellor@bloomberg.net, Paul JarvisFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.",,These Are The Stocks to Watch as U.K. Heads to the Polls Again

Vindman said that Kashyap Patel ""misrepresented"" himself, and despite having no experience or expertise on Ukraine, was part of the White House's Ukraine policy discussion, Politico reports. Vindman found this out after he attended Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's inauguration in May, and was preparing to give Trump a debriefing on the event and Zelensky's plans for the future, he reportedly testified. Vindman revealed that ""at the last second,"" his boss at the time, Fiona Hill, told him not to attend the debriefing because it might confuse Trump, who thought Patel was the top Ukraine expert.Patel, Nunes' top staffer on the House Intelligence Committee, was known for trying to discredit Justice Department and FBI officials who investigated Russian meddling in the 2016 election, Politico reports. He joined the White House in February, and in July, was promoted to a senior counterterrorism role. Hill testified earlier this month that Trump thought Patel was in charge of the National Security Council's Ukraine policy, Politico says.Vindman, who told investigators he's never had a conversation with Patel, also said he was told Patel ignored National Security Council procedures and put negative information about Ukraine in front of Trump, which reinforced his belief that the country was corrupt, Politico reports.

"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:17:36 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/record-wave-lone-child-migrants-122133758.html,"TENOSIQUE, Mexico -- The United States has detained more children trying to cross the nation's southwest border on their own over the last year than during any other period on record, surpassing the surge of unaccompanied minors that set off a crisis during the Obama administration, according to new figures released Tuesday.U.S. immigration authorities apprehended 76,020 minors, most of them from Central America, traveling without their parents in the fiscal year that ended in September -- 52% more than during the last fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Mexico is experiencing the same surge. Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period -- pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.In interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous -- and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.""These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,"" Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters. ""And each month during the fiscal year, the numbers increased. You saw them. We all saw them.""The young migrants came alongside a historic wave of families traveling together, also largely from Central America. They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.Marvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced -- and he pressed on.""Quitting was not an option,"" Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. ""You wipe your tears and carry on.""For the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they'd kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.His parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said. ""We can't bear losing another son,"" they told him. ""You have to go.""He left home in the spring, with $40 in his pocket and no plan except to find work in a safer place.As for most underage migrants traveling without their parents, his trip north has been a feat of improvisation and courage. He walked and hitchhiked through Honduras and Guatemala. He slept in churches, under trees or wherever he found himself when night fell.Along the way, he gathered crucial bits of information from fellow migrants: the best route to take, locations of shelters up ahead, places to avoid, where to forage for food.As huge numbers of young migrants from Central America began arriving at the United States' southern border in 2014, the Obama administration scrambled to house them until they could be released to sponsors -- adults who applied to care for them. The shelter system grew dramatically as a result.The Trump administration experienced similar backups at the border just a few years later -- this time because of new, more stringent policies that made the sponsors themselves, who are often undocumented, vulnerable to immigration authorities. This discouraged people from coming forward, leaving thousands of children to languish in the system.The Trump administration has also sought to deter migration by separating thousands of children from their relatives, again driving up the number of children in federally contracted shelters.On the road, while trying to avoid detention, fear and hunger are constant companions for many young migrants.With little or no money in their pockets, they relied on strangers for snacks or meals. They pawed through garbage and scanned drifts of debris on the roadside, hoping to spot an edible morsel.Wilson, a 17-year-old Honduran, said he had feasted on rotten mangos discarded by street vendors.""I used to drink water from potholes when I was too thirsty,"" interjected Mario Leonel, 16, who left home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, several weeks ago without notifying his parents. ""That is the hardest part of it all: the hunger.""When he arrived at the shelter in Tenosique, a small Mexican town near the Guatemala border, he called his parents in Honduras, who burst into tears and pleaded for him to return. He said no. He was tired of all the violence in his country, and wanted to get asylum in the United States.After Marvel slipped across the Guatemala-Mexico border in May, he found room at a shelter in Tenosique, which serves as a transit point for many migrants. He quickly made new friends among other teenage migrants who had made it this far, mainly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador.On a recent afternoon, several of them gathered in a two-story building that had been reserved for minors, its walls painted with colorful animal murals. The boys cracked jokes, roughhoused and argued about who was the cutest girl in the shelter.Outside, Dulce, a 16-year-old transgender migrant from Guatemala, sat alone on train tracks pining for a boy she had met at the shelter. He had left without explanation and she was lovesick.""I just can't get him out of my mind,"" she said.She left her hometown four months earlier to escape abuse from her family and strangers, including a sexual assault by gang members when she was 12. She made it as far as central Mexico before being detained and deported. Five days after returning home, she set off again.""I left because I had nothing there and no one to protect me,"" she said. ""At least here I am safe.""Though the United States remains the destination of choice for most unaccompanied minors, an increasing number are setting their sights no farther than Mexico, advocates and migrants say.Sometimes they have no choice: Mexico's increased enforcement measures have made it more difficult for migrants to make it to the border with the United States. And even if they reach the United States, recent policies have drastically lowered the possibilities of getting asylum.In Mexico, when unaccompanied minors are detained, the law mandates that they be released right away into the custody of the national child protection agency, which finds them accommodation in shelters designed for children.But migrants' advocates say the government has been holding children in the nation's overcrowded detention centers for far too long, and that some children are quickly funneled into the deportation process rather than being given a fair chance to seek asylum or some other form of relief.""No child should ever be held at a detention center,"" said Elba Coria, a migration expert from the Clinic for Refugees at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City. ""But while international standards consider children's detention as an exceptional measure, amid Mexico's migration chaos, it is the rule.""Neither Marvel nor any of his new friends in the Tenosique shelter had been detained by the authorities. All had managed to cross into Mexico from Guatemala and had applied for asylum in Mexico after talking through their options with the shelter staff.They now plan to remain in Mexico and look for work and study opportunities -- even if they haven't abandoned hope of making it to the United States.""It is every Honduran's boy dream to get to the United States, where there is more money and kids are able to go to school,"" said Jose Angel, 17. He was born with a disability that left him unable to use his arms and left his hometown because his grandmother could no longer take care of him.He was hopeful he could apply for asylum in the United States despite Trump's many efforts to severely lower the number of people granted asylum. ""It is scary, but you have to take a chance,"" he said.On a recent morning, Alan, a 17-year-old Guatemalan migrant, sat on the sidewalk outside a migrant shelter in the city of Palenque, in southern Mexico. He had just crossed the border and was exhausted. Mexican immigration officials had stopped a bus he was on, but he managed to escape into the countryside and hide.Alan planned to take a nap, shower and have a meal before trying illegally to board a freight train known as The Beast. It runs from Mexico's border with Guatemala to its border with the United States and, for decades, migrants have clung to it to speed through much of Mexico.His hope was to make it to the U.S. border and petition for asylum. He was undeterred by Trump's recent efforts to restrict asylum claims or curb immigration.""One way or another, I have to make it to the other side where there are skyscrapers and life is better,"" he said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5ol82jExNHqBHa7IGzz2mw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/03f35d3f9d537a8dc9fe503d06c098de,"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation"

Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 10:05:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-warren-untenable-plans-140521979.html,"If you’ve been having trouble finding someone to walk your dog, don’t worry. Any day now, Elizabeth Warren will announce “a plan for that.” It will undoubtedly be comprehensive, detailed, and replete with subsidies for lower- and middle-class dog walkers and underserved breeds. It will cost tens of billions of dollars and will receive widespread positive notice from the media. However, to judge by her other recent plans, the one thing it won’t include is any discussion of how she plans to pay for it.The Massachusetts senator has challenged and possibly overtaken former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, largely based on having a plan for the government to tackle every problem facing this country, no matter how big or how small, from issues with military housing to Puerto Rican debt to climate change.The price tag for this massive expansion of government is enormous. Much of the attention in recent weeks has been focused on Warren’s embrace of Medicare for All, which she refuses to admit would require an increase in middle-class taxes. Even Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has conceded that such proposals, which would cost $30–40 trillion over 10 years, cannot be financed without tax hikes. Warren’s refusal to address this obvious fact makes her look less like a would-be policy wonk and more like a typical politician.But even setting aside Medicare for All, Warren’s plans are likely to dump oceans of red ink onto our growing national debt. Her non-health-care spending proposals already total some $7.5 trillion per year over the next 10 years. Although these are not quite Bernie levels of government largesse, her proposals would still require nearly double our current levels of spending.To pay for all this, Warren proposes a variety of tax hikes, mostly designed to hit corporations or high-earners: higher payroll taxes for those earning more than $250,000 per year; a 7 percent profits tax on companies earning more than $100 million; a 60 percent lobbying tax on firms that spend a million or more on lobbying, and so forth. But the biggest chunk of money would come from Warren’s proposed “wealth tax,” a 2 to 3 percent levy on net worth above $50 million. Warren estimates that this wealth tax will pull in more than $2.75 trillion over ten years. It won’t.First, there is the slight problem that a wealth tax is probably unconstitutional. Of course, constitutional constraints are quaint notions in the Age of Trump. Regardless, it is worth noting that the Constitution permits the federal government to impose only “direct taxes,” such as a property tax. That’s why it required a constitutional amendment to enact the federal income tax. Many constitutional scholars warn that a wealth tax is neither a direct tax nor income tax.Even if Warren can find a way around the constitutional guardrails -- perhaps by something such as a retrospective wealth tax in which you wait until a taxpayer sells assets or passes away -- a wealth tax is unlikely to raise anywhere near the amount of money she predicts.Simply look at Europe’s experiments with wealth taxes. At one time, a dozen European countries imposed wealth taxes. Today, all but three have abandoned those levies. Among those repealing their wealth tax are the Scandinavian social democracies that Warren admires, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Norway retains a wealth tax but has significantly reduced it in recent years. Additional countries abandoning the tax include Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Other countries, such as Great Britain, have considered wealth taxes and rejected them.They did so because wealth taxes are administratively complex and difficult to enforce. Also, they significantly reduce investment, entrepreneurship, and, ultimately, economic growth. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, European wealth taxes raised, on average, only about 0.2 percent of GDP in revenues. By comparison, the U.S. federal income tax raises 8 percent of GDP.Two groups, however, would benefit substantially from a wealth tax. The tax would be a full-employment opportunity for the tax-preparation industry and for lawyers. After all, we would now have to determine fair market value for everything from homes and vehicles to artwork and jewelry to family pension rights and intellectual property. The other big winner would be lobbyists, who could be expected to descend on Washington en masse seeking exemptions and exceptions for their clients. If you think the tax code is a mess today, just wait until D.C. is done with Warren’s plan.There is an old Yiddish proverb that goes “Mann tracht, un Gott Lacht,” or “Man plans, and God laughs.” It is all well and good that Senator Warren has a plan for everything. But until she actually figures out how to pay for everything without crippling our economy, such plans really don’t add up.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/t_XOfhQ2Q8pn0Eihbaza4g--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/710b4188b8e44ebd02c332c03dfb8d66,Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans
Meghan McCain Spars With Cory Booker Over Civility: Beto Was ‘Very Nasty’ to Me!,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:39:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/meghan-mccain-spars-cory-booker-163901660.html,"During a Wednesday interview with Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, The View’s Meghan McCain did what she apparently does best: Make the conversation about herself and, in this case, her personal beef with a presidential hopeful.After applauding Booker for saying Medicare for All is unrealistic, the conservative View co-host took issue with the New Jersey senator’s support for mandatory gun buybacks. This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he’s going to take her brother’s guns.After a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they’d continue the conversation in the next segment.“No we’re not,” McCain grumbled. “It’s fine.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

"Former &lt;/&gt;Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:11:25 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/former-time-editor-wants-hate-211125098.html,"A former Time editor claimed that the United States needs a law banning hate speech, and that President Donald Trump “might be in violation of it” if there were one -- because, apparently, he doesn’t notice the irony of holding both of these views at once.In a Tuesday tweet promoting his Washington Post piece, titled “Why America needs a hate speech law,” Richard Stengel stated:> My @WashingtonPost piece on why the very broadness of the First Amendment suggests we should have a hate speech law. And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f> > -- Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019In the piece, Stengel writes that “many nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred” in the wake of World War II:> These laws started out as protections against the kinds of anti-Semitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws, but there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general, hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.“I’m all for protecting ‘thought that we hate,’ but not speech that incites hate,” he continues. “It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.”It’s interesting how Stengel actually does acknowledge the fact that “there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is,” and yet he still wants laws banning it. This makes absolutely no sense. After all, when he calls for laws to ban “hate speech,” he is, inherently, giving the government the power to decide what would and would not qualify -- the exact same government that is led by Donald Trump, and that is full of people who support him.In other words: Stengel somehow trusts that the government will have the same view of “hate speech” as he does, and then, in the same thought, seems to acknowledge that there’s actually no way that many of them would. Unless he thinks that the president and his congressional supporters would actually pass a law that they’d be in violation of, his argument for “hate speech” laws winds up being a pretty great argument against them.It’s ironic, but it’s not new: More often than not, it’s the uber-progressives arguing for laws against “hate speech” -- despite the fact that they’re often the same people who are also arguing that Donald Trump and Republicans are constantly spewing it. Maybe it’s just me, but if I thought that the leader of my government was, you know, literally Hitler or whatever, the last thing that I’d want would be to give that person and their supporters control over my speech.Yes, the First Amendment gives us the right to be “offensive” with our speech. Given the fact that a new thing seems to be declared “racist” or “sexist” every day, I’m certainly glad that we do have this protection. After all, it would only take there being a few too many of the “super woke” in our government for a phrase like “you guys” to become a criminal offense.The truth is, though, the right to be “offensive” (however you define that subjective term, anyway) is not even the most important role that our First Amendment plays. No, what’s most important is that it protects our right to speak out against the government when we see fit -- without having to worry about its retaliation. Like it or not, the only way to ensure that we retain this important check on government power is to never (ever) give its leaders a vehicle take it away.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eTNessteMBpuBTcqmJGuYw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/bae9af12e23cce197b317b5c1be56053,"Former </>Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony"

Denmark Snubs Trump With Approval of Russian Gas Pipe to Europe,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 14:14:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/denmark-snubs-trump-approval-russian-141104626.html,"(Bloomberg) -- In a major boost for Russia’s effort to tighten its grip over natural gas supplies to western Europe, Denmark said it will allow the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline to pass through its territory.The decision removes the last important hurdle for the $11 billion project, which is slated for commissioning by the end of this year and bolster gas flows from Siberia into Germany. The link has drawn the threat of sanctions from the U.S., which wants Europe to buy its liquefied natural gas. It risks reigniting a feud between Donald Trump and Danish lawmakers that erupted in the summer after the U.S. president’s offer to buy Greenland.Russian President Vladimir Putin welcomed the pipeline decision. “Denmark showed itself to be a responsible participant in international relations, defending its interests and sovereignty and the interests of its main partners in Europe,” he told a briefing in Budapest, where he was on a visit.The green light gives Gazprom PJSC, Russia’s gas export champion and already Europe’s biggest supplier, yet another route to one of the world’s most liquid gas markets. While Trump has accused Russia of using its natural gas as a political weapon, it’s ultimately a commercial deal over which Washington has little influence, according to Raffaello Pantucci, Director of Security Studies at the Royal United Services Institute in London.“It’s frankly too far advanced,” Pantucci said. “Who are they going to sanction?”The approval also gives Russia more clout in ongoing talks with Ukraine on a new gas transit deal, increasing the risk of a disruption from Jan. 1. Uncertainty about whether those two nations can agree on time has been weighing on forward prices in Europe and sending incentives for traders to stockpile gas as a cushion against disruption.“If Gazprom are confident in Nord Stream 2’s imminent completion, it may encourage a tougher negotiating stance on any new Ukrainian transit deal,” said John Twomey, a gas analyst at BloombergNEF in London. “If anything, the risks of a disruption on Jan. 1 have gone up as a result of this.”The pipeline has divided EU governments, with nations led by Poland concerned about the bloc’s increasing dependence on Russian gas.“It is not too late to stop NS2,” an official at the U.S. embassy in Germany said. “There are clear negative energy security and geopolitical implications for Europe from Putin’s pipeline. The U.S. government agrees with the European Parliament, the U.S. House and nearly 20 European countries in our opposition to NS2.”Russia, Ukraine, Europe Pledge New Gas Deal by Year-EndDenmark said on Wednesday it will allow the pipeline to pass southeast of the island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea. The company behind the pipeline submitted the route plan in April. Denmark had been conducting a security and environmental review of the project.Trump had objected to the link, instead urging the European Union to diversify the sources of its energy and dilute Putin’s economic influence over the region. U.S. officials have also warned that project partners are at an elevated risk of U.S. sanctions.The approval is another snub of Trump by the Nordic country after it ruled out his proposal to buy Greenland this summer. The president responded by canceling a state visit to Denmark.The Danish approval covers 147 kilometers (91 miles) of the project. Nord Stream 2 said in its statement that it has already completed 87%, or 2,100 kilometers, of the pipeline in Russian, Finnish and Swedish waters as well as most of the German part. Dan Jorgensen, Denmark’s minister for climate, energy and utilities, declined to comment on Wednesday.Nord Stream 2 said it will continue its “constructive cooperation with the Danish authorities to complete the pipeline.”Six WeeksGazprom CEO Alexey Miller said that the pipeline is expected to be completed on time by the end of the year. “The remaining 147 kilometers -- that’s five weeks of work,” Miller told reporters in Budapest.A statement from the company highlighted some uncertainties in that timetable. Nord Stream 2 said Wednesday the actual start of the construction depends on a number of legal, technical and environmental factors, which will “take a few weeks” and the project aims for completion “in the coming months.”Gazprom can’t use the permit for the next four weeks when all involved parties have leeway to make a complaint under Danish law. Those issues left analysts anticipating some delay beyond Jan. 1 for the completion of the link.“It’s unlikely that Nord Stream 2 is online in time for Jan. 1, so Ukrainian transit disruption risks remains,” said Twomey.While Gazprom owns the pipeline, half the financing of the 8 billion-euro capital cost comes from five European companies: Uniper SE and Wintershall of Germany, OMV AG of Austria, Engie SA of France and Royal Dutch Shell Plc.Dutch gas for the first quarter declined to the lowest since at least 2017 as the region is oversupplied with the fuel, storage sites across Europe are full, and LNG imports surge.(Updates with Putin comment in third paragraph.)\--With assistance from Dina Khrennikova, Vanessa Dezem and Ilya Arkhipov.To contact the reporters on this story: Morten Buttler in Copenhagen at mbuttler@bloomberg.net;William Wilkes in Frankfurt at wwilkes1@bloomberg.net;Anna Shiryaevskaya in London at ashiryaevska@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Christian Wienberg at cwienberg@bloomberg.net, ;Tasneem Hanfi Brögger at tbrogger@bloomberg.net, ;Nick Rigillo at nrigillo@bloomberg.net, Gregory L.

"White House blocked effort to condemn Russia for seizing Ukraine ships, Congress told","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 16:46:00 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/white-house-blocked-effort-condemn-204600202.html,"State department aide makes revelation in testimony, while Russia envoy nominee John Sullivan grilled at confirmation hearingDonald Trump with Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Osaka in June this year. Trump voiced concern over the 2018 capture but did not blame Moscow. Photograph: Mikhail Klimentyev/TassThe White House blocked the US state department from issuing a statement condemning Russia for seizing Ukrainian military vessels, according to a state department official, in the latest example of the strain the Trump administration is under in pursuing conflicting policies towards the two countries.The revelation on Wednesday came from Christopher Anderson, who was a senior aide to the special envoy on Ukraine, Kurt Volker, in November 2018, when Russia fired on and captured three Ukrainian vessels in the Sea of Azov off the Crimean peninsula.“While my colleagues at the state department quickly prepared a statement condemning Russia for its escalation, senior officials in the White House blocked it from being issued,” Anderson said in his prepared remarks to congressional committees holding impeachment hearings. “Ambassador Volker drafted a tweet condemning Russia’s actions, which I posted to his account.”In the face of silence from the White House, the then US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, condemned Russian behaviour, after which the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, followed suit. Trump voiced concern but did not blame Moscow.The 24 Ukrainian sailors detained in the operation were returned last month as part of a prisoner exchange.Anderson, and his successor in the Ukraine job, Catherine Croft, both testified to House committees on Wednesday about the role played by Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, in foiling state department efforts to bolster the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in the face of Russian military intervention in eastern Ukraine.In his testimony, Anderson quoted the former national security adviser, John Bolton, as saying: “Giuliani was a key voice with the president on Ukraine which could be an obstacle to increased White House engagement.” On Wednesday, the House committees asked Bolton to testify on 7 November, but it is unclear whether he will attend.Bolton’s former deputy, Charles Kupperman, is currently seeking a court ruling on whether to comply with his congressional subpoena in the face of a White House order not to testify.At the other side of Congress, the nominee to become ambassador to Russia, John Sullivan, faced pointed questions on Wednesday at confirmation hearings in the Senate about Giuliani and the split US policy towards Russia and Ukraine.Sullivan, currently the deputy secretary of state, said he was aware of Giuliani’s role in a campaign against the former US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. Asked if he knew Trump’s lawyer was “seeking to smear” Yovanovitch, he replied: “I believe he was, yes.”Sullivan confirmed he had been shown a dossier of material attacking Yovanovitch, saying it had provided by the White House to the state department legal adviser, but he was not aware it had been put together by Giuliani. He said the dossier “didn’t provide to me a basis for taking action against our ambassador”.He said that Pompeo gave Sullivan no explanation for the decision to recall Yovanovitch before the end of her posting, other than she had “lost the confidence of the president”.“As I understand, [Trump] may decide that he doesn’t like my testimony today and he doesn’t want me to go to Russia. The president can decide when he loses confidence in his ambassador – then that person is not going to continue as ambassador,” Sullivan said.Sullivan sought to avoid taking a position on the testimony by several former and current state department officials that the president, through Giuliani, had made a White House meeting and US military aid dependent on the Ukrainian government investigating Trump’s political rivals.“Soliciting investigations into a domestic political opponent – I don’t think that would be in accord with our values,” Sullivan said. But he would not confirm that was what the president had done.Democratic senators signaled that they were prepared to support Sullivan’s nomination as an experienced and respected diplomat, acknowledging the difficult position he was in. But they expressed concern he had not done more to find out what Trump and Giuliani were trying to achieve in Ukraine.The ranking Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee, Bob Menendez, told Sullivan he had been playing the role of “see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.”“You’re going to go to Russia, and you’re going to be saying one set of things based upon your testimony here,” Menendez said. “And we have the president who, in his public statements, is totally aligned differently than what you’re going to be saying.”“Do you understand the incredibly difficult job that you’re going to have as a result of that?” Menendez asked Sullivan.“I would say, senator, you’ve cited the president’s statements. I’d cite the president’s actions,” the nominee replied, listing sanctions the administration had imposed on Russia.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3dFxIoizaUY49lyZT_4bZQ--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/e71dc403755334597d5e870705964abd,"White House blocked effort to condemn Russia for seizing Ukraine ships, Congress told"

"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:17:36 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/record-wave-lone-child-migrants-122133758.html,"TENOSIQUE, Mexico -- The United States has detained more children trying to cross the nation's southwest border on their own over the last year than during any other period on record, surpassing the surge of unaccompanied minors that set off a crisis during the Obama administration, according to new figures released Tuesday.U.S. immigration authorities apprehended 76,020 minors, most of them from Central America, traveling without their parents in the fiscal year that ended in September -- 52% more than during the last fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Mexico is experiencing the same surge. Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period -- pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.In interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous -- and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.""These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,"" Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters. ""And each month during the fiscal year, the numbers increased. You saw them. We all saw them.""The young migrants came alongside a historic wave of families traveling together, also largely from Central America. They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.Marvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced -- and he pressed on.""Quitting was not an option,"" Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. ""You wipe your tears and carry on.""For the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they'd kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.His parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said. ""We can't bear losing another son,"" they told him. ""You have to go.""He left home in the spring, with $40 in his pocket and no plan except to find work in a safer place.As for most underage migrants traveling without their parents, his trip north has been a feat of improvisation and courage. He walked and hitchhiked through Honduras and Guatemala. He slept in churches, under trees or wherever he found himself when night fell.Along the way, he gathered crucial bits of information from fellow migrants: the best route to take, locations of shelters up ahead, places to avoid, where to forage for food.As huge numbers of young migrants from Central America began arriving at the United States' southern border in 2014, the Obama administration scrambled to house them until they could be released to sponsors -- adults who applied to care for them. The shelter system grew dramatically as a result.The Trump administration experienced similar backups at the border just a few years later -- this time because of new, more stringent policies that made the sponsors themselves, who are often undocumented, vulnerable to immigration authorities. This discouraged people from coming forward, leaving thousands of children to languish in the system.The Trump administration has also sought to deter migration by separating thousands of children from their relatives, again driving up the number of children in federally contracted shelters.On the road, while trying to avoid detention, fear and hunger are constant companions for many young migrants.With little or no money in their pockets, they relied on strangers for snacks or meals. They pawed through garbage and scanned drifts of debris on the roadside, hoping to spot an edible morsel.Wilson, a 17-year-old Honduran, said he had feasted on rotten mangos discarded by street vendors.""I used to drink water from potholes when I was too thirsty,"" interjected Mario Leonel, 16, who left home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, several weeks ago without notifying his parents. ""That is the hardest part of it all: the hunger.""When he arrived at the shelter in Tenosique, a small Mexican town near the Guatemala border, he called his parents in Honduras, who burst into tears and pleaded for him to return. He said no. He was tired of all the violence in his country, and wanted to get asylum in the United States.After Marvel slipped across the Guatemala-Mexico border in May, he found room at a shelter in Tenosique, which serves as a transit point for many migrants. He quickly made new friends among other teenage migrants who had made it this far, mainly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador.On a recent afternoon, several of them gathered in a two-story building that had been reserved for minors, its walls painted with colorful animal murals. The boys cracked jokes, roughhoused and argued about who was the cutest girl in the shelter.Outside, Dulce, a 16-year-old transgender migrant from Guatemala, sat alone on train tracks pining for a boy she had met at the shelter. He had left without explanation and she was lovesick.""I just can't get him out of my mind,"" she said.She left her hometown four months earlier to escape abuse from her family and strangers, including a sexual assault by gang members when she was 12. She made it as far as central Mexico before being detained and deported. Five days after returning home, she set off again.""I left because I had nothing there and no one to protect me,"" she said. ""At least here I am safe.""Though the United States remains the destination of choice for most unaccompanied minors, an increasing number are setting their sights no farther than Mexico, advocates and migrants say.Sometimes they have no choice: Mexico's increased enforcement measures have made it more difficult for migrants to make it to the border with the United States. And even if they reach the United States, recent policies have drastically lowered the possibilities of getting asylum.In Mexico, when unaccompanied minors are detained, the law mandates that they be released right away into the custody of the national child protection agency, which finds them accommodation in shelters designed for children.But migrants' advocates say the government has been holding children in the nation's overcrowded detention centers for far too long, and that some children are quickly funneled into the deportation process rather than being given a fair chance to seek asylum or some other form of relief.""No child should ever be held at a detention center,"" said Elba Coria, a migration expert from the Clinic for Refugees at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City. ""But while international standards consider children's detention as an exceptional measure, amid Mexico's migration chaos, it is the rule.""Neither Marvel nor any of his new friends in the Tenosique shelter had been detained by the authorities. All had managed to cross into Mexico from Guatemala and had applied for asylum in Mexico after talking through their options with the shelter staff.They now plan to remain in Mexico and look for work and study opportunities -- even if they haven't abandoned hope of making it to the United States.""It is every Honduran's boy dream to get to the United States, where there is more money and kids are able to go to school,"" said Jose Angel, 17. He was born with a disability that left him unable to use his arms and left his hometown because his grandmother could no longer take care of him.He was hopeful he could apply for asylum in the United States despite Trump's many efforts to severely lower the number of people granted asylum. ""It is scary, but you have to take a chance,"" he said.On a recent morning, Alan, a 17-year-old Guatemalan migrant, sat on the sidewalk outside a migrant shelter in the city of Palenque, in southern Mexico. He had just crossed the border and was exhausted. Mexican immigration officials had stopped a bus he was on, but he managed to escape into the countryside and hide.Alan planned to take a nap, shower and have a meal before trying illegally to board a freight train known as The Beast. It runs from Mexico's border with Guatemala to its border with the United States and, for decades, migrants have clung to it to speed through much of Mexico.His hope was to make it to the U.S. border and petition for asylum. He was undeterred by Trump's recent efforts to restrict asylum claims or curb immigration.""One way or another, I have to make it to the other side where there are skyscrapers and life is better,"" he said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5ol82jExNHqBHa7IGzz2mw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/03f35d3f9d537a8dc9fe503d06c098de,"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation"
Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 10:05:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-warren-untenable-plans-140521979.html,"If you’ve been having trouble finding someone to walk your dog, don’t worry. Any day now, Elizabeth Warren will announce “a plan for that.” It will undoubtedly be comprehensive, detailed, and replete with subsidies for lower- and middle-class dog walkers and underserved breeds. It will cost tens of billions of dollars and will receive widespread positive notice from the media. However, to judge by her other recent plans, the one thing it won’t include is any discussion of how she plans to pay for it.The Massachusetts senator has challenged and possibly overtaken former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, largely based on having a plan for the government to tackle every problem facing this country, no matter how big or how small, from issues with military housing to Puerto Rican debt to climate change.The price tag for this massive expansion of government is enormous. Much of the attention in recent weeks has been focused on Warren’s embrace of Medicare for All, which she refuses to admit would require an increase in middle-class taxes. Even Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has conceded that such proposals, which would cost $30–40 trillion over 10 years, cannot be financed without tax hikes. Warren’s refusal to address this obvious fact makes her look less like a would-be policy wonk and more like a typical politician.But even setting aside Medicare for All, Warren’s plans are likely to dump oceans of red ink onto our growing national debt. Her non-health-care spending proposals already total some $7.5 trillion per year over the next 10 years. Although these are not quite Bernie levels of government largesse, her proposals would still require nearly double our current levels of spending.To pay for all this, Warren proposes a variety of tax hikes, mostly designed to hit corporations or high-earners: higher payroll taxes for those earning more than $250,000 per year; a 7 percent profits tax on companies earning more than $100 million; a 60 percent lobbying tax on firms that spend a million or more on lobbying, and so forth. But the biggest chunk of money would come from Warren’s proposed “wealth tax,” a 2 to 3 percent levy on net worth above $50 million. Warren estimates that this wealth tax will pull in more than $2.75 trillion over ten years. It won’t.First, there is the slight problem that a wealth tax is probably unconstitutional. Of course, constitutional constraints are quaint notions in the Age of Trump. Regardless, it is worth noting that the Constitution permits the federal government to impose only “direct taxes,” such as a property tax. That’s why it required a constitutional amendment to enact the federal income tax. Many constitutional scholars warn that a wealth tax is neither a direct tax nor income tax.Even if Warren can find a way around the constitutional guardrails -- perhaps by something such as a retrospective wealth tax in which you wait until a taxpayer sells assets or passes away -- a wealth tax is unlikely to raise anywhere near the amount of money she predicts.Simply look at Europe’s experiments with wealth taxes. At one time, a dozen European countries imposed wealth taxes. Today, all but three have abandoned those levies. Among those repealing their wealth tax are the Scandinavian social democracies that Warren admires, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Norway retains a wealth tax but has significantly reduced it in recent years. Additional countries abandoning the tax include Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Other countries, such as Great Britain, have considered wealth taxes and rejected them.They did so because wealth taxes are administratively complex and difficult to enforce. Also, they significantly reduce investment, entrepreneurship, and, ultimately, economic growth. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, European wealth taxes raised, on average, only about 0.2 percent of GDP in revenues. By comparison, the U.S. federal income tax raises 8 percent of GDP.Two groups, however, would benefit substantially from a wealth tax. The tax would be a full-employment opportunity for the tax-preparation industry and for lawyers. After all, we would now have to determine fair market value for everything from homes and vehicles to artwork and jewelry to family pension rights and intellectual property. The other big winner would be lobbyists, who could be expected to descend on Washington en masse seeking exemptions and exceptions for their clients. If you think the tax code is a mess today, just wait until D.C. is done with Warren’s plan.There is an old Yiddish proverb that goes “Mann tracht, un Gott Lacht,” or “Man plans, and God laughs.” It is all well and good that Senator Warren has a plan for everything. But until she actually figures out how to pay for everything without crippling our economy, such plans really don’t add up.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/t_XOfhQ2Q8pn0Eihbaza4g--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/710b4188b8e44ebd02c332c03dfb8d66,Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans

Meghan McCain Spars With Cory Booker Over Civility: Beto Was ‘Very Nasty’ to Me!,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:39:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/meghan-mccain-spars-cory-booker-163901660.html,"During a Wednesday interview with Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, The View’s Meghan McCain did what she apparently does best: Make the conversation about herself and, in this case, her personal beef with a presidential hopeful.After applauding Booker for saying Medicare for All is unrealistic, the conservative View co-host took issue with the New Jersey senator’s support for mandatory gun buybacks. This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he’s going to take her brother’s guns.After a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they’d continue the conversation in the next segment.“No we’re not,” McCain grumbled. “It’s fine.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

"Former &lt;/&gt;Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:11:25 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/former-time-editor-wants-hate-211125098.html,"A former Time editor claimed that the United States needs a law banning hate speech, and that President Donald Trump “might be in violation of it” if there were one -- because, apparently, he doesn’t notice the irony of holding both of these views at once.In a Tuesday tweet promoting his Washington Post piece, titled “Why America needs a hate speech law,” Richard Stengel stated:> My @WashingtonPost piece on why the very broadness of the First Amendment suggests we should have a hate speech law. And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f> > -- Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019In the piece, Stengel writes that “many nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred” in the wake of World War II:> These laws started out as protections against the kinds of anti-Semitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws, but there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general, hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.“I’m all for protecting ‘thought that we hate,’ but not speech that incites hate,” he continues. “It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.”It’s interesting how Stengel actually does acknowledge the fact that “there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is,” and yet he still wants laws banning it. This makes absolutely no sense. After all, when he calls for laws to ban “hate speech,” he is, inherently, giving the government the power to decide what would and would not qualify -- the exact same government that is led by Donald Trump, and that is full of people who support him.In other words: Stengel somehow trusts that the government will have the same view of “hate speech” as he does, and then, in the same thought, seems to acknowledge that there’s actually no way that many of them would. Unless he thinks that the president and his congressional supporters would actually pass a law that they’d be in violation of, his argument for “hate speech” laws winds up being a pretty great argument against them.It’s ironic, but it’s not new: More often than not, it’s the uber-progressives arguing for laws against “hate speech” -- despite the fact that they’re often the same people who are also arguing that Donald Trump and Republicans are constantly spewing it. Maybe it’s just me, but if I thought that the leader of my government was, you know, literally Hitler or whatever, the last thing that I’d want would be to give that person and their supporters control over my speech.Yes, the First Amendment gives us the right to be “offensive” with our speech. Given the fact that a new thing seems to be declared “racist” or “sexist” every day, I’m certainly glad that we do have this protection. After all, it would only take there being a few too many of the “super woke” in our government for a phrase like “you guys” to become a criminal offense.The truth is, though, the right to be “offensive” (however you define that subjective term, anyway) is not even the most important role that our First Amendment plays. No, what’s most important is that it protects our right to speak out against the government when we see fit -- without having to worry about its retaliation. Like it or not, the only way to ensure that we retain this important check on government power is to never (ever) give its leaders a vehicle take it away.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eTNessteMBpuBTcqmJGuYw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/bae9af12e23cce197b317b5c1be56053,"Former </>Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony"

She said the project would feature a museum, library, gym, and forum.“Barack and I wouldn’t bring some crap up in our neighborhood,” she reportedly said. She pointed out that she hails from the area by birth and that her husband Barack comes from South Side by choice.During his speech at the forum, Barack Obama said: “We joke about it a little bit, like this is the mothership.”While they hope the center could anchor a potential economic revival in the area, there have been setbacks.Opponents of the project are pursuing a federal court appeal after losing a lawsuit.

How did we get there?”After noting that he lives near one of the fires in the Los Angeles area, Rubin immediately took aim at liberal politics as the main reason the wildfires have grown so large and dangerous.“The problem right now is that everything, EVERYTHING, from academia to public utilities to politics, everything that goes woke, that buys into this ridiculous progressive ideology that cares about what contractors are LGBT or how many black firemen we have or white this or Asian that, everything that goes that road eventually breaks down,” he declared.As Carlson nodded and said “that’s true,” Rubin continued, complaining that this isn’t how “freedom is supposed to operate.”“What is supposed to happen—imagine if your house was on fire,” he added. “Would you care what the public utility or what the fire company, what contractor they brought in, what gender or sexuality or any of those things he or she was? It’s just absolutely ridiculous.”The Fox News host continued to agree with Rubin, who went on to tie PG&E;’s preemptive blackouts to a lack of “libertarian or conservative-minded people in California to fight what the progressives are doing to the state.”“If you can’t keep the lights on and you can’t keep the place from burning down, you’ve reached the point where there is no kind of lying about it anymore,” Carlson concluded. “It’s falling apart. It’s a disaster. It’s not civilized anymore.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

"More than 1,000 homeless people died in Los Angeles county last year","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 16:20:14 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/homeless-deaths-la-county-double-202014816.html,"The county’s public health department has reported 1,047 deaths for last year, a number that has increased steadily since 2013A woman pushes a cart full of her belongings past tents near Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles. Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty ImagesMore than 1,000 homeless people died in Los Angeles county in 2018, double the number of deaths from six years ago. The increase is a stark illustration of the region’s severe housing crisis, advocates said.The LA county public health department reported this week that 1,047 homeless people died last year, a number that has steadily increased every year since 2013, when 536 people died. The leading causes of death were coronary heart disease, which accounted for 22% of deaths, followed by alcohol and drug overdose at 21%, transportation-related injuries at 9%, homicides at 6% and suicides at 5%.The data sheds light on a worsening public health emergency in the county, where officials estimate there are now 59,000 people homeless, including more than 44,000 people who are living unsheltered – in cars, tents, or makeshift quarters. The report also follows a string of high-profile attacks against homeless people in the area, including the killing of Darrell Fields, a beloved musician who was burned to death in his tent on Skid Row.“We’ve got three people a day dying on the streets,” said Adam Rice, an organizer with Los Angeles Community Action Network (LA Can), a group that had worked closely with Fields. “It is a complete failure of leadership. Darrell didn’t need to die. None of these people needed to die. The reason this is happening is because there’s not proper housing.”Darrell Fields, 62, was a homeless man in Los Angeles known as Mr Guitar. He was killed in August when his tent was set ablaze. Photograph: Los Angeles Community Action NetworkSoaring rents and a major shortage of affordable housing have pushed people out of their homes in the area, with more than half of unsheltered adults in a recent count saying they were experiencing homelessness for the first time. The county estimated that there are now 8,800 homeless families.“It brings an overwhelming sadness when you think about precious human beings dying in our streets when it can be avoided,” said the Rev Andy Bales, CEO of Union Rescue Mission (URM), which runs a shelter at Skid Row, at the epicenter of the crisis in downtown LA.The county’s analysis also found that the mortality rate among homeless people has also jumped: “Put simply, being homeless in LA county is becoming increasingly deadly,” the agency wrote.The increase in overdoses represented the largest jump in terms of causes of death, the report found. In addition, the mortality rate among white homeless people has decreased while the rate of deaths for black and Latino residents has increased, the county said. Overall, African Americans are four times more likely to experience homelessness in LA county than other groups.Of the transportation-related deaths, which include vehicle and train collisions, 82% of victims were pedestrians and cyclists.The county and local clinics have increasingly sent healthcare workers to encampments to try to serve people on the streets. More than 21,000 homeless people were also placed in housing last year, an increase from 2017, officials reported early this year.The health department report this week recommended more direct outreach to homeless people, the creation of a “death review team” to study the subject and more traffic safety measures near encampments.Bales predicted that medical visits were not enough to reverse the deadly trends: “What we need most is for everyone to be immediately under a roof and protected from the elements. Until that happens, the death rates will continue to grow … and more and more people will be devastated by homelessness.”The crisis demanded a more urgent response, he added: “How much evidence do we need to gather before we decide not to let another human being die on the street?”LA’s homeless crisis has recently received national attention, with the Trump administration suggesting it could pursue some kind of law enforcement crackdown, drawing skepticism from some local organizations. Advocates have criticized efforts to further criminalize people living on the streets and have argued that the government needs to put more funding to housing and shelter.“It’s really a travesty when you think about it. How many deaths could’ve been prevented?” said Kourtney Milligan, a 29-year-old homeless woman, who has lived on Skid Row. “The resources that they say are out there are so hard to find.”",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/s2XrfBGfKBrVbz9mGlm7bg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/f15aa3ae803200f5d01035f9967bdb02,"More than 1,000 homeless people died in Los Angeles county last year"

Vindman revealed that ""at the last second,"" his boss at the time, Fiona Hill, told him not to attend the debriefing because it might confuse Trump, who thought Patel was the top Ukraine expert.Patel, Nunes' top staffer on the House Intelligence Committee, was known for trying to discredit Justice Department and FBI officials who investigated Russian meddling in the 2016 election, Politico reports. He joined the White House in February, and in July, was promoted to a senior counterterrorism role. Hill testified earlier this month that Trump thought Patel was in charge of the National Security Council's Ukraine policy, Politico says.Vindman, who told investigators he's never had a conversation with Patel, also said he was told Patel ignored National Security Council procedures and put negative information about Ukraine in front of Trump, which reinforced his belief that the country was corrupt, Politico reports.

"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:17:36 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/record-wave-lone-child-migrants-122133758.html,"TENOSIQUE, Mexico -- The United States has detained more children trying to cross the nation's southwest border on their own over the last year than during any other period on record, surpassing the surge of unaccompanied minors that set off a crisis during the Obama administration, according to new figures released Tuesday.U.S. immigration authorities apprehended 76,020 minors, most of them from Central America, traveling without their parents in the fiscal year that ended in September -- 52% more than during the last fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Mexico is experiencing the same surge. Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period -- pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.In interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous -- and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.""These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,"" Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters. ""And each month during the fiscal year, the numbers increased. You saw them. We all saw them.""The young migrants came alongside a historic wave of families traveling together, also largely from Central America. They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.Marvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced -- and he pressed on.""Quitting was not an option,"" Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. ""You wipe your tears and carry on.""For the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they'd kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.His parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said. ""We can't bear losing another son,"" they told him. ""You have to go.""He left home in the spring, with $40 in his pocket and no plan except to find work in a safer place.As for most underage migrants traveling without their parents, his trip north has been a feat of improvisation and courage. He walked and hitchhiked through Honduras and Guatemala. He slept in churches, under trees or wherever he found himself when night fell.Along the way, he gathered crucial bits of information from fellow migrants: the best route to take, locations of shelters up ahead, places to avoid, where to forage for food.As huge numbers of young migrants from Central America began arriving at the United States' southern border in 2014, the Obama administration scrambled to house them until they could be released to sponsors -- adults who applied to care for them. The shelter system grew dramatically as a result.The Trump administration experienced similar backups at the border just a few years later -- this time because of new, more stringent policies that made the sponsors themselves, who are often undocumented, vulnerable to immigration authorities. This discouraged people from coming forward, leaving thousands of children to languish in the system.The Trump administration has also sought to deter migration by separating thousands of children from their relatives, again driving up the number of children in federally contracted shelters.On the road, while trying to avoid detention, fear and hunger are constant companions for many young migrants.With little or no money in their pockets, they relied on strangers for snacks or meals. They pawed through garbage and scanned drifts of debris on the roadside, hoping to spot an edible morsel.Wilson, a 17-year-old Honduran, said he had feasted on rotten mangos discarded by street vendors.""I used to drink water from potholes when I was too thirsty,"" interjected Mario Leonel, 16, who left home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, several weeks ago without notifying his parents. ""That is the hardest part of it all: the hunger.""When he arrived at the shelter in Tenosique, a small Mexican town near the Guatemala border, he called his parents in Honduras, who burst into tears and pleaded for him to return. He said no. He was tired of all the violence in his country, and wanted to get asylum in the United States.After Marvel slipped across the Guatemala-Mexico border in May, he found room at a shelter in Tenosique, which serves as a transit point for many migrants. He quickly made new friends among other teenage migrants who had made it this far, mainly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador.On a recent afternoon, several of them gathered in a two-story building that had been reserved for minors, its walls painted with colorful animal murals. The boys cracked jokes, roughhoused and argued about who was the cutest girl in the shelter.Outside, Dulce, a 16-year-old transgender migrant from Guatemala, sat alone on train tracks pining for a boy she had met at the shelter. He had left without explanation and she was lovesick.""I just can't get him out of my mind,"" she said.She left her hometown four months earlier to escape abuse from her family and strangers, including a sexual assault by gang members when she was 12. She made it as far as central Mexico before being detained and deported. Five days after returning home, she set off again.""I left because I had nothing there and no one to protect me,"" she said. ""At least here I am safe.""Though the United States remains the destination of choice for most unaccompanied minors, an increasing number are setting their sights no farther than Mexico, advocates and migrants say.Sometimes they have no choice: Mexico's increased enforcement measures have made it more difficult for migrants to make it to the border with the United States. And even if they reach the United States, recent policies have drastically lowered the possibilities of getting asylum.In Mexico, when unaccompanied minors are detained, the law mandates that they be released right away into the custody of the national child protection agency, which finds them accommodation in shelters designed for children.But migrants' advocates say the government has been holding children in the nation's overcrowded detention centers for far too long, and that some children are quickly funneled into the deportation process rather than being given a fair chance to seek asylum or some other form of relief.""No child should ever be held at a detention center,"" said Elba Coria, a migration expert from the Clinic for Refugees at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City. ""But while international standards consider children's detention as an exceptional measure, amid Mexico's migration chaos, it is the rule.""Neither Marvel nor any of his new friends in the Tenosique shelter had been detained by the authorities. All had managed to cross into Mexico from Guatemala and had applied for asylum in Mexico after talking through their options with the shelter staff.They now plan to remain in Mexico and look for work and study opportunities -- even if they haven't abandoned hope of making it to the United States.""It is every Honduran's boy dream to get to the United States, where there is more money and kids are able to go to school,"" said Jose Angel, 17. He was born with a disability that left him unable to use his arms and left his hometown because his grandmother could no longer take care of him.He was hopeful he could apply for asylum in the United States despite Trump's many efforts to severely lower the number of people granted asylum. ""It is scary, but you have to take a chance,"" he said.On a recent morning, Alan, a 17-year-old Guatemalan migrant, sat on the sidewalk outside a migrant shelter in the city of Palenque, in southern Mexico. He had just crossed the border and was exhausted. Mexican immigration officials had stopped a bus he was on, but he managed to escape into the countryside and hide.Alan planned to take a nap, shower and have a meal before trying illegally to board a freight train known as The Beast. It runs from Mexico's border with Guatemala to its border with the United States and, for decades, migrants have clung to it to speed through much of Mexico.His hope was to make it to the U.S. border and petition for asylum. He was undeterred by Trump's recent efforts to restrict asylum claims or curb immigration.""One way or another, I have to make it to the other side where there are skyscrapers and life is better,"" he said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5ol82jExNHqBHa7IGzz2mw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/03f35d3f9d537a8dc9fe503d06c098de,"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation"
Denmark Snubs Trump With Approval of Russian Gas Pipe to Europe,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 14:14:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/denmark-snubs-trump-approval-russian-141104626.html,"(Bloomberg) -- In a major boost for Russia’s effort to tighten its grip over natural gas supplies to western Europe, Denmark said it will allow the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline to pass through its territory.The decision removes the last important hurdle for the $11 billion project, which is slated for commissioning by the end of this year and bolster gas flows from Siberia into Germany. The link has drawn the threat of sanctions from the U.S., which wants Europe to buy its liquefied natural gas. It risks reigniting a feud between Donald Trump and Danish lawmakers that erupted in the summer after the U.S. president’s offer to buy Greenland.Russian President Vladimir Putin welcomed the pipeline decision. “Denmark showed itself to be a responsible participant in international relations, defending its interests and sovereignty and the interests of its main partners in Europe,” he told a briefing in Budapest, where he was on a visit.The green light gives Gazprom PJSC, Russia’s gas export champion and already Europe’s biggest supplier, yet another route to one of the world’s most liquid gas markets. While Trump has accused Russia of using its natural gas as a political weapon, it’s ultimately a commercial deal over which Washington has little influence, according to Raffaello Pantucci, Director of Security Studies at the Royal United Services Institute in London.“It’s frankly too far advanced,” Pantucci said. “Who are they going to sanction?”The approval also gives Russia more clout in ongoing talks with Ukraine on a new gas transit deal, increasing the risk of a disruption from Jan. 1. Uncertainty about whether those two nations can agree on time has been weighing on forward prices in Europe and sending incentives for traders to stockpile gas as a cushion against disruption.“If Gazprom are confident in Nord Stream 2’s imminent completion, it may encourage a tougher negotiating stance on any new Ukrainian transit deal,” said John Twomey, a gas analyst at BloombergNEF in London. “If anything, the risks of a disruption on Jan. 1 have gone up as a result of this.”The pipeline has divided EU governments, with nations led by Poland concerned about the bloc’s increasing dependence on Russian gas.“It is not too late to stop NS2,” an official at the U.S. embassy in Germany said. “There are clear negative energy security and geopolitical implications for Europe from Putin’s pipeline. The U.S. government agrees with the European Parliament, the U.S. House and nearly 20 European countries in our opposition to NS2.”Russia, Ukraine, Europe Pledge New Gas Deal by Year-EndDenmark said on Wednesday it will allow the pipeline to pass southeast of the island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea. The company behind the pipeline submitted the route plan in April. Denmark had been conducting a security and environmental review of the project.Trump had objected to the link, instead urging the European Union to diversify the sources of its energy and dilute Putin’s economic influence over the region. U.S. officials have also warned that project partners are at an elevated risk of U.S. sanctions.The approval is another snub of Trump by the Nordic country after it ruled out his proposal to buy Greenland this summer. The president responded by canceling a state visit to Denmark.The Danish approval covers 147 kilometers (91 miles) of the project. Nord Stream 2 said in its statement that it has already completed 87%, or 2,100 kilometers, of the pipeline in Russian, Finnish and Swedish waters as well as most of the German part. Dan Jorgensen, Denmark’s minister for climate, energy and utilities, declined to comment on Wednesday.Nord Stream 2 said it will continue its “constructive cooperation with the Danish authorities to complete the pipeline.”Six WeeksGazprom CEO Alexey Miller said that the pipeline is expected to be completed on time by the end of the year. “The remaining 147 kilometers -- that’s five weeks of work,” Miller told reporters in Budapest.A statement from the company highlighted some uncertainties in that timetable. Nord Stream 2 said Wednesday the actual start of the construction depends on a number of legal, technical and environmental factors, which will “take a few weeks” and the project aims for completion “in the coming months.”Gazprom can’t use the permit for the next four weeks when all involved parties have leeway to make a complaint under Danish law. Those issues left analysts anticipating some delay beyond Jan. 1 for the completion of the link.“It’s unlikely that Nord Stream 2 is online in time for Jan. 1, so Ukrainian transit disruption risks remains,” said Twomey.While Gazprom owns the pipeline, half the financing of the 8 billion-euro capital cost comes from five European companies: Uniper SE and Wintershall of Germany, OMV AG of Austria, Engie SA of France and Royal Dutch Shell Plc.Dutch gas for the first quarter declined to the lowest since at least 2017 as the region is oversupplied with the fuel, storage sites across Europe are full, and LNG imports surge.(Updates with Putin comment in third paragraph.)\--With assistance from Dina Khrennikova, Vanessa Dezem and Ilya Arkhipov.To contact the reporters on this story: Morten Buttler in Copenhagen at mbuttler@bloomberg.net;William Wilkes in Frankfurt at wwilkes1@bloomberg.net;Anna Shiryaevskaya in London at ashiryaevska@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Christian Wienberg at cwienberg@bloomberg.net, ;Tasneem Hanfi Brögger at tbrogger@bloomberg.net, ;Nick Rigillo at nrigillo@bloomberg.net, Gregory L.

Meghan McCain Spars With Cory Booker Over Civility: Beto Was ‘Very Nasty’ to Me!,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:39:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/meghan-mccain-spars-cory-booker-163901660.html,"During a Wednesday interview with Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, The View’s Meghan McCain did what she apparently does best: Make the conversation about herself and, in this case, her personal beef with a presidential hopeful.After applauding Booker for saying Medicare for All is unrealistic, the conservative View co-host took issue with the New Jersey senator’s support for mandatory gun buybacks. This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he’s going to take her brother’s guns.After a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they’d continue the conversation in the next segment.“No we’re not,” McCain grumbled. “It’s fine.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 10:05:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-warren-untenable-plans-140521979.html,"If you’ve been having trouble finding someone to walk your dog, don’t worry. Any day now, Elizabeth Warren will announce “a plan for that.” It will undoubtedly be comprehensive, detailed, and replete with subsidies for lower- and middle-class dog walkers and underserved breeds. It will cost tens of billions of dollars and will receive widespread positive notice from the media. However, to judge by her other recent plans, the one thing it won’t include is any discussion of how she plans to pay for it.The Massachusetts senator has challenged and possibly overtaken former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, largely based on having a plan for the government to tackle every problem facing this country, no matter how big or how small, from issues with military housing to Puerto Rican debt to climate change.The price tag for this massive expansion of government is enormous. Much of the attention in recent weeks has been focused on Warren’s embrace of Medicare for All, which she refuses to admit would require an increase in middle-class taxes. Even Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has conceded that such proposals, which would cost $30–40 trillion over 10 years, cannot be financed without tax hikes. Warren’s refusal to address this obvious fact makes her look less like a would-be policy wonk and more like a typical politician.But even setting aside Medicare for All, Warren’s plans are likely to dump oceans of red ink onto our growing national debt. Her non-health-care spending proposals already total some $7.5 trillion per year over the next 10 years. Although these are not quite Bernie levels of government largesse, her proposals would still require nearly double our current levels of spending.To pay for all this, Warren proposes a variety of tax hikes, mostly designed to hit corporations or high-earners: higher payroll taxes for those earning more than $250,000 per year; a 7 percent profits tax on companies earning more than $100 million; a 60 percent lobbying tax on firms that spend a million or more on lobbying, and so forth. But the biggest chunk of money would come from Warren’s proposed “wealth tax,” a 2 to 3 percent levy on net worth above $50 million. Warren estimates that this wealth tax will pull in more than $2.75 trillion over ten years. It won’t.First, there is the slight problem that a wealth tax is probably unconstitutional. Of course, constitutional constraints are quaint notions in the Age of Trump. Regardless, it is worth noting that the Constitution permits the federal government to impose only “direct taxes,” such as a property tax. That’s why it required a constitutional amendment to enact the federal income tax. Many constitutional scholars warn that a wealth tax is neither a direct tax nor income tax.Even if Warren can find a way around the constitutional guardrails -- perhaps by something such as a retrospective wealth tax in which you wait until a taxpayer sells assets or passes away -- a wealth tax is unlikely to raise anywhere near the amount of money she predicts.Simply look at Europe’s experiments with wealth taxes. At one time, a dozen European countries imposed wealth taxes. Today, all but three have abandoned those levies. Among those repealing their wealth tax are the Scandinavian social democracies that Warren admires, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Norway retains a wealth tax but has significantly reduced it in recent years. Additional countries abandoning the tax include Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Other countries, such as Great Britain, have considered wealth taxes and rejected them.They did so because wealth taxes are administratively complex and difficult to enforce. Also, they significantly reduce investment, entrepreneurship, and, ultimately, economic growth. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, European wealth taxes raised, on average, only about 0.2 percent of GDP in revenues. By comparison, the U.S. federal income tax raises 8 percent of GDP.Two groups, however, would benefit substantially from a wealth tax. The tax would be a full-employment opportunity for the tax-preparation industry and for lawyers. After all, we would now have to determine fair market value for everything from homes and vehicles to artwork and jewelry to family pension rights and intellectual property. The other big winner would be lobbyists, who could be expected to descend on Washington en masse seeking exemptions and exceptions for their clients. If you think the tax code is a mess today, just wait until D.C. is done with Warren’s plan.There is an old Yiddish proverb that goes “Mann tracht, un Gott Lacht,” or “Man plans, and God laughs.” It is all well and good that Senator Warren has a plan for everything. But until she actually figures out how to pay for everything without crippling our economy, such plans really don’t add up.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/t_XOfhQ2Q8pn0Eihbaza4g--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/710b4188b8e44ebd02c332c03dfb8d66,Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans

How did we get there?”After noting that he lives near one of the fires in the Los Angeles area, Rubin immediately took aim at liberal politics as the main reason the wildfires have grown so large and dangerous.“The problem right now is that everything, EVERYTHING, from academia to public utilities to politics, everything that goes woke, that buys into this ridiculous progressive ideology that cares about what contractors are LGBT or how many black firemen we have or white this or Asian that, everything that goes that road eventually breaks down,” he declared.As Carlson nodded and said “that’s true,” Rubin continued, complaining that this isn’t how “freedom is supposed to operate.”“What is supposed to happen—imagine if your house was on fire,” he added. “Would you care what the public utility or what the fire company, what contractor they brought in, what gender or sexuality or any of those things he or she was? It’s just absolutely ridiculous.”The Fox News host continued to agree with Rubin, who went on to tie PG&E;’s preemptive blackouts to a lack of “libertarian or conservative-minded people in California to fight what the progressives are doing to the state.”“If you can’t keep the lights on and you can’t keep the place from burning down, you’ve reached the point where there is no kind of lying about it anymore,” Carlson concluded. “It’s falling apart.

NYC Medical Examiner Dismisses Epstein ‘Homicide’ Claim by Dr. Michael Baden,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 15:28:10 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/nyc-medical-examiner-dismisses-epstein-192810863.html,"Robyn Beck/ReutersNew York City’s chief medical examiner pushed back hard Wednesday against a celebrity pathologist-for-hire’s conspiracy-stirring claim that Jeffrey Epstein’s autopsy was more consistent with homicide than suicide.“The original medical investigation was thorough and complete. There is no reason for a second medical investigation by our office,” said Dr. Barbara Sampson.Sampson determined Epstein died by suicide from hanging in his jail cell in August, while he was awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.Epstein’s lawyers and family have refused to accept her finding, and the disgraced financier’s brother hired Dr. Michael Baden—erstwhile host of HBO’s Autopsy—to do his own investigation.Jeffrey Epstein’s Death Ruled Suicide by Hanging: New York City Medical ExaminerDuring an appearance Wednesday morning on Fox News, where he is a contributor, Baden said his own review isn’t complete but nonetheless suggested that suicide isn’t the cause of death.He claimed a collection of neck fractures in Epstein’s hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage “are extremely unusual in suicidal hangings and could occur much more commonly in homicidal strangulation.”“I’ve not seen in 50 years where that occurred in a suicidal hanging case,” Baden said.Although more common in homicidal strangulation cases, some studies have found that hyoid and thyroid fractures are not rare in suicidal hangings.A 2000 study in Australia found fractures in nearly half the 40 suicide cases it examined and said they were even more common in older victims and men; in fact, 15 percent had fractures of both the hyoid and the thyroid. And a 2010 study out of Thailand found such fractures in 25 percent of the confirmed suicides it reviewed.After His Suicide Watch Ended, Jeffrey Epstein Was Left to Look After HimselfBaden, who observed the autopsy performed by Sampson, served briefly as the city’s chief medical examiner before being fired in 1979 by then-Mayor Ed Koch in response to a complaint that he told doctors during a guest-speaking event that Gov. Nelson Rockefeller had died during sexual intercourse.Three years later, he was dismissed as chief deputy medical examiner by Suffolk County, New York, over a magazine article about ways to kill that wouldn’t show up in an autopsy; he protested that he was misquoted.In the '70s, Baden helped Congress investigate the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.—he concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald and James Earl Ray, respectively, were the killers—but became famous for serving as a private pathologist in high-profile cases like the Aaron Hernandez suicide, the O.J. Simpson murder trial, and the Jayson Williams shooting. He also served as a defense witness in the Phil Spector murder trial, where he reportedly testified that he had no conflict of interest in the case even though his wife was heading Spector’s legal team.Baden isn’t the only one skeptical about the official account of Epstein’s death at the high-security federal lockup in Manhattan, which is currently the subject of a Justice Department probe.Spencer Kuvin, a lawyer representing victims of Epstein, said serious questions remain, including the whereabouts of the guards assigned to monitor him, why the cameras outside his cell apparently didn’t work, and why he was taken off suicide watch.“It all makes no sense. Until they come out with the evidence, I don’t believe anything they’re telling us,” Kuvin said. “Exactly what happened I can’t tell you, but I certainly don’t believe the story they’re trying to feed everyone.”Sigrid McCawley, an attorney at Boies Schiller Flexner, the law firm representing some of Epstein’s victims, said the ongoing Justice Department probe “limits what can and should be said at this time.”“But as the public has come to to understand the horrifying scope and scale of the international sex trafficking system he operated for decades with impunity, what really matters for the brave survivors who are seeking justice is how he lived, not how he died,” she said. “That is how the man should be judged.”Kuvin said his clients are “more interested in seeing co-conspirators prosecuted” than in delving into Epstein autopsy theories.“The justice system failed. They either allowed him to take his own life or someone got in there and killed him,” Kuvin told The Daily Beast. “Either way, it’s a failure of the Justice Department… [which] has failed them repeatedly over the last 13 years. This was just one more time.”If you or a loved one are struggling with suicidal thoughts, please reach out to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), or contact the Crisis Text Line by texting TALK to 741741Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

"Former &lt;/&gt;Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:11:25 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/former-time-editor-wants-hate-211125098.html,"A former Time editor claimed that the United States needs a law banning hate speech, and that President Donald Trump “might be in violation of it” if there were one -- because, apparently, he doesn’t notice the irony of holding both of these views at once.In a Tuesday tweet promoting his Washington Post piece, titled “Why America needs a hate speech law,” Richard Stengel stated:> My @WashingtonPost piece on why the very broadness of the First Amendment suggests we should have a hate speech law. And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f> > -- Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019In the piece, Stengel writes that “many nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred” in the wake of World War II:> These laws started out as protections against the kinds of anti-Semitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws, but there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general, hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.“I’m all for protecting ‘thought that we hate,’ but not speech that incites hate,” he continues. “It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.”It’s interesting how Stengel actually does acknowledge the fact that “there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is,” and yet he still wants laws banning it. This makes absolutely no sense. After all, when he calls for laws to ban “hate speech,” he is, inherently, giving the government the power to decide what would and would not qualify -- the exact same government that is led by Donald Trump, and that is full of people who support him.In other words: Stengel somehow trusts that the government will have the same view of “hate speech” as he does, and then, in the same thought, seems to acknowledge that there’s actually no way that many of them would. Unless he thinks that the president and his congressional supporters would actually pass a law that they’d be in violation of, his argument for “hate speech” laws winds up being a pretty great argument against them.It’s ironic, but it’s not new: More often than not, it’s the uber-progressives arguing for laws against “hate speech” -- despite the fact that they’re often the same people who are also arguing that Donald Trump and Republicans are constantly spewing it. Maybe it’s just me, but if I thought that the leader of my government was, you know, literally Hitler or whatever, the last thing that I’d want would be to give that person and their supporters control over my speech.Yes, the First Amendment gives us the right to be “offensive” with our speech. Given the fact that a new thing seems to be declared “racist” or “sexist” every day, I’m certainly glad that we do have this protection. After all, it would only take there being a few too many of the “super woke” in our government for a phrase like “you guys” to become a criminal offense.The truth is, though, the right to be “offensive” (however you define that subjective term, anyway) is not even the most important role that our First Amendment plays. No, what’s most important is that it protects our right to speak out against the government when we see fit -- without having to worry about its retaliation. Like it or not, the only way to ensure that we retain this important check on government power is to never (ever) give its leaders a vehicle take it away.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eTNessteMBpuBTcqmJGuYw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/bae9af12e23cce197b317b5c1be56053,"Former </>Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony"

"More than 1,000 homeless people died in Los Angeles county last year","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 16:20:14 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/homeless-deaths-la-county-double-202014816.html,"The county’s public health department has reported 1,047 deaths for last year, a number that has increased steadily since 2013A woman pushes a cart full of her belongings past tents near Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles. Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty ImagesMore than 1,000 homeless people died in Los Angeles county in 2018, double the number of deaths from six years ago. The increase is a stark illustration of the region’s severe housing crisis, advocates said.The LA county public health department reported this week that 1,047 homeless people died last year, a number that has steadily increased every year since 2013, when 536 people died. The leading causes of death were coronary heart disease, which accounted for 22% of deaths, followed by alcohol and drug overdose at 21%, transportation-related injuries at 9%, homicides at 6% and suicides at 5%.The data sheds light on a worsening public health emergency in the county, where officials estimate there are now 59,000 people homeless, including more than 44,000 people who are living unsheltered – in cars, tents, or makeshift quarters. The report also follows a string of high-profile attacks against homeless people in the area, including the killing of Darrell Fields, a beloved musician who was burned to death in his tent on Skid Row.“We’ve got three people a day dying on the streets,” said Adam Rice, an organizer with Los Angeles Community Action Network (LA Can), a group that had worked closely with Fields. “It is a complete failure of leadership. Darrell didn’t need to die. None of these people needed to die. The reason this is happening is because there’s not proper housing.”Darrell Fields, 62, was a homeless man in Los Angeles known as Mr Guitar. He was killed in August when his tent was set ablaze. Photograph: Los Angeles Community Action NetworkSoaring rents and a major shortage of affordable housing have pushed people out of their homes in the area, with more than half of unsheltered adults in a recent count saying they were experiencing homelessness for the first time. The county estimated that there are now 8,800 homeless families.“It brings an overwhelming sadness when you think about precious human beings dying in our streets when it can be avoided,” said the Rev Andy Bales, CEO of Union Rescue Mission (URM), which runs a shelter at Skid Row, at the epicenter of the crisis in downtown LA.The county’s analysis also found that the mortality rate among homeless people has also jumped: “Put simply, being homeless in LA county is becoming increasingly deadly,” the agency wrote.The increase in overdoses represented the largest jump in terms of causes of death, the report found. In addition, the mortality rate among white homeless people has decreased while the rate of deaths for black and Latino residents has increased, the county said. Overall, African Americans are four times more likely to experience homelessness in LA county than other groups.Of the transportation-related deaths, which include vehicle and train collisions, 82% of victims were pedestrians and cyclists.The county and local clinics have increasingly sent healthcare workers to encampments to try to serve people on the streets. More than 21,000 homeless people were also placed in housing last year, an increase from 2017, officials reported early this year.The health department report this week recommended more direct outreach to homeless people, the creation of a “death review team” to study the subject and more traffic safety measures near encampments.Bales predicted that medical visits were not enough to reverse the deadly trends: “What we need most is for everyone to be immediately under a roof and protected from the elements. Until that happens, the death rates will continue to grow … and more and more people will be devastated by homelessness.”The crisis demanded a more urgent response, he added: “How much evidence do we need to gather before we decide not to let another human being die on the street?”LA’s homeless crisis has recently received national attention, with the Trump administration suggesting it could pursue some kind of law enforcement crackdown, drawing skepticism from some local organizations. Advocates have criticized efforts to further criminalize people living on the streets and have argued that the government needs to put more funding to housing and shelter.“It’s really a travesty when you think about it. How many deaths could’ve been prevented?” said Kourtney Milligan, a 29-year-old homeless woman, who has lived on Skid Row. “The resources that they say are out there are so hard to find.”",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/s2XrfBGfKBrVbz9mGlm7bg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/f15aa3ae803200f5d01035f9967bdb02,"More than 1,000 homeless people died in Los Angeles county last year"

"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:17:36 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/record-wave-lone-child-migrants-122133758.html,"TENOSIQUE, Mexico -- The United States has detained more children trying to cross the nation's southwest border on their own over the last year than during any other period on record, surpassing the surge of unaccompanied minors that set off a crisis during the Obama administration, according to new figures released Tuesday.U.S. immigration authorities apprehended 76,020 minors, most of them from Central America, traveling without their parents in the fiscal year that ended in September -- 52% more than during the last fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Mexico is experiencing the same surge. Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period -- pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.In interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous -- and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.""These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,"" Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters. ""And each month during the fiscal year, the numbers increased. You saw them. We all saw them.""The young migrants came alongside a historic wave of families traveling together, also largely from Central America. They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.Marvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced -- and he pressed on.""Quitting was not an option,"" Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. ""You wipe your tears and carry on.""For the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they'd kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.His parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said. ""We can't bear losing another son,"" they told him. ""You have to go.""He left home in the spring, with $40 in his pocket and no plan except to find work in a safer place.As for most underage migrants traveling without their parents, his trip north has been a feat of improvisation and courage. He walked and hitchhiked through Honduras and Guatemala. He slept in churches, under trees or wherever he found himself when night fell.Along the way, he gathered crucial bits of information from fellow migrants: the best route to take, locations of shelters up ahead, places to avoid, where to forage for food.As huge numbers of young migrants from Central America began arriving at the United States' southern border in 2014, the Obama administration scrambled to house them until they could be released to sponsors -- adults who applied to care for them. The shelter system grew dramatically as a result.The Trump administration experienced similar backups at the border just a few years later -- this time because of new, more stringent policies that made the sponsors themselves, who are often undocumented, vulnerable to immigration authorities. This discouraged people from coming forward, leaving thousands of children to languish in the system.The Trump administration has also sought to deter migration by separating thousands of children from their relatives, again driving up the number of children in federally contracted shelters.On the road, while trying to avoid detention, fear and hunger are constant companions for many young migrants.With little or no money in their pockets, they relied on strangers for snacks or meals. They pawed through garbage and scanned drifts of debris on the roadside, hoping to spot an edible morsel.Wilson, a 17-year-old Honduran, said he had feasted on rotten mangos discarded by street vendors.""I used to drink water from potholes when I was too thirsty,"" interjected Mario Leonel, 16, who left home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, several weeks ago without notifying his parents. ""That is the hardest part of it all: the hunger.""When he arrived at the shelter in Tenosique, a small Mexican town near the Guatemala border, he called his parents in Honduras, who burst into tears and pleaded for him to return. He said no. He was tired of all the violence in his country, and wanted to get asylum in the United States.After Marvel slipped across the Guatemala-Mexico border in May, he found room at a shelter in Tenosique, which serves as a transit point for many migrants. He quickly made new friends among other teenage migrants who had made it this far, mainly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador.On a recent afternoon, several of them gathered in a two-story building that had been reserved for minors, its walls painted with colorful animal murals. The boys cracked jokes, roughhoused and argued about who was the cutest girl in the shelter.Outside, Dulce, a 16-year-old transgender migrant from Guatemala, sat alone on train tracks pining for a boy she had met at the shelter. He had left without explanation and she was lovesick.""I just can't get him out of my mind,"" she said.She left her hometown four months earlier to escape abuse from her family and strangers, including a sexual assault by gang members when she was 12. She made it as far as central Mexico before being detained and deported. Five days after returning home, she set off again.""I left because I had nothing there and no one to protect me,"" she said. ""At least here I am safe.""Though the United States remains the destination of choice for most unaccompanied minors, an increasing number are setting their sights no farther than Mexico, advocates and migrants say.Sometimes they have no choice: Mexico's increased enforcement measures have made it more difficult for migrants to make it to the border with the United States. And even if they reach the United States, recent policies have drastically lowered the possibilities of getting asylum.In Mexico, when unaccompanied minors are detained, the law mandates that they be released right away into the custody of the national child protection agency, which finds them accommodation in shelters designed for children.But migrants' advocates say the government has been holding children in the nation's overcrowded detention centers for far too long, and that some children are quickly funneled into the deportation process rather than being given a fair chance to seek asylum or some other form of relief.""No child should ever be held at a detention center,"" said Elba Coria, a migration expert from the Clinic for Refugees at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City. ""But while international standards consider children's detention as an exceptional measure, amid Mexico's migration chaos, it is the rule.""Neither Marvel nor any of his new friends in the Tenosique shelter had been detained by the authorities. All had managed to cross into Mexico from Guatemala and had applied for asylum in Mexico after talking through their options with the shelter staff.They now plan to remain in Mexico and look for work and study opportunities -- even if they haven't abandoned hope of making it to the United States.""It is every Honduran's boy dream to get to the United States, where there is more money and kids are able to go to school,"" said Jose Angel, 17. He was born with a disability that left him unable to use his arms and left his hometown because his grandmother could no longer take care of him.He was hopeful he could apply for asylum in the United States despite Trump's many efforts to severely lower the number of people granted asylum. ""It is scary, but you have to take a chance,"" he said.On a recent morning, Alan, a 17-year-old Guatemalan migrant, sat on the sidewalk outside a migrant shelter in the city of Palenque, in southern Mexico. He had just crossed the border and was exhausted.

Denmark Snubs Trump With Approval of Russian Gas Pipe to Europe,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 14:14:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/denmark-snubs-trump-approval-russian-141104626.html,"(Bloomberg) -- In a major boost for Russia’s effort to tighten its grip over natural gas supplies to western Europe, Denmark said it will allow the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline to pass through its territory.The decision removes the last important hurdle for the $11 billion project, which is slated for commissioning by the end of this year and bolster gas flows from Siberia into Germany. The link has drawn the threat of sanctions from the U.S., which wants Europe to buy its liquefied natural gas. It risks reigniting a feud between Donald Trump and Danish lawmakers that erupted in the summer after the U.S. president’s offer to buy Greenland.Russian President Vladimir Putin welcomed the pipeline decision. “Denmark showed itself to be a responsible participant in international relations, defending its interests and sovereignty and the interests of its main partners in Europe,” he told a briefing in Budapest, where he was on a visit.The green light gives Gazprom PJSC, Russia’s gas export champion and already Europe’s biggest supplier, yet another route to one of the world’s most liquid gas markets. While Trump has accused Russia of using its natural gas as a political weapon, it’s ultimately a commercial deal over which Washington has little influence, according to Raffaello Pantucci, Director of Security Studies at the Royal United Services Institute in London.“It’s frankly too far advanced,” Pantucci said. “Who are they going to sanction?”The approval also gives Russia more clout in ongoing talks with Ukraine on a new gas transit deal, increasing the risk of a disruption from Jan. 1. Uncertainty about whether those two nations can agree on time has been weighing on forward prices in Europe and sending incentives for traders to stockpile gas as a cushion against disruption.“If Gazprom are confident in Nord Stream 2’s imminent completion, it may encourage a tougher negotiating stance on any new Ukrainian transit deal,” said John Twomey, a gas analyst at BloombergNEF in London. “If anything, the risks of a disruption on Jan. 1 have gone up as a result of this.”The pipeline has divided EU governments, with nations led by Poland concerned about the bloc’s increasing dependence on Russian gas.“It is not too late to stop NS2,” an official at the U.S. embassy in Germany said. “There are clear negative energy security and geopolitical implications for Europe from Putin’s pipeline. The U.S. government agrees with the European Parliament, the U.S. House and nearly 20 European countries in our opposition to NS2.”Russia, Ukraine, Europe Pledge New Gas Deal by Year-EndDenmark said on Wednesday it will allow the pipeline to pass southeast of the island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea. The company behind the pipeline submitted the route plan in April. Denmark had been conducting a security and environmental review of the project.Trump had objected to the link, instead urging the European Union to diversify the sources of its energy and dilute Putin’s economic influence over the region. U.S. officials have also warned that project partners are at an elevated risk of U.S. sanctions.The approval is another snub of Trump by the Nordic country after it ruled out his proposal to buy Greenland this summer. The president responded by canceling a state visit to Denmark.The Danish approval covers 147 kilometers (91 miles) of the project. Nord Stream 2 said in its statement that it has already completed 87%, or 2,100 kilometers, of the pipeline in Russian, Finnish and Swedish waters as well as most of the German part. Dan Jorgensen, Denmark’s minister for climate, energy and utilities, declined to comment on Wednesday.Nord Stream 2 said it will continue its “constructive cooperation with the Danish authorities to complete the pipeline.”Six WeeksGazprom CEO Alexey Miller said that the pipeline is expected to be completed on time by the end of the year. “The remaining 147 kilometers -- that’s five weeks of work,” Miller told reporters in Budapest.A statement from the company highlighted some uncertainties in that timetable. Nord Stream 2 said Wednesday the actual start of the construction depends on a number of legal, technical and environmental factors, which will “take a few weeks” and the project aims for completion “in the coming months.”Gazprom can’t use the permit for the next four weeks when all involved parties have leeway to make a complaint under Danish law. Those issues left analysts anticipating some delay beyond Jan. 1 for the completion of the link.“It’s unlikely that Nord Stream 2 is online in time for Jan. 1, so Ukrainian transit disruption risks remains,” said Twomey.While Gazprom owns the pipeline, half the financing of the 8 billion-euro capital cost comes from five European companies: Uniper SE and Wintershall of Germany, OMV AG of Austria, Engie SA of France and Royal Dutch Shell Plc.Dutch gas for the first quarter declined to the lowest since at least 2017 as the region is oversupplied with the fuel, storage sites across Europe are full, and LNG imports surge.(Updates with Putin comment in third paragraph.)\--With assistance from Dina Khrennikova, Vanessa Dezem and Ilya Arkhipov.To contact the reporters on this story: Morten Buttler in Copenhagen at mbuttler@bloomberg.net;William Wilkes in Frankfurt at wwilkes1@bloomberg.net;Anna Shiryaevskaya in London at ashiryaevska@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Christian Wienberg at cwienberg@bloomberg.net, ;Tasneem Hanfi Brögger at tbrogger@bloomberg.net, ;Nick Rigillo at nrigillo@bloomberg.net, Gregory L.

Meghan McCain Spars With Cory Booker Over Civility: Beto Was ‘Very Nasty’ to Me!,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:39:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/meghan-mccain-spars-cory-booker-163901660.html,"During a Wednesday interview with Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, The View’s Meghan McCain did what she apparently does best: Make the conversation about herself and, in this case, her personal beef with a presidential hopeful.After applauding Booker for saying Medicare for All is unrealistic, the conservative View co-host took issue with the New Jersey senator’s support for mandatory gun buybacks. This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he’s going to take her brother’s guns.After a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they’d continue the conversation in the next segment.“No we’re not,” McCain grumbled. “It’s fine.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 10:05:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-warren-untenable-plans-140521979.html,"If you’ve been having trouble finding someone to walk your dog, don’t worry. Any day now, Elizabeth Warren will announce “a plan for that.” It will undoubtedly be comprehensive, detailed, and replete with subsidies for lower- and middle-class dog walkers and underserved breeds. It will cost tens of billions of dollars and will receive widespread positive notice from the media. However, to judge by her other recent plans, the one thing it won’t include is any discussion of how she plans to pay for it.The Massachusetts senator has challenged and possibly overtaken former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, largely based on having a plan for the government to tackle every problem facing this country, no matter how big or how small, from issues with military housing to Puerto Rican debt to climate change.The price tag for this massive expansion of government is enormous. Much of the attention in recent weeks has been focused on Warren’s embrace of Medicare for All, which she refuses to admit would require an increase in middle-class taxes. Even Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has conceded that such proposals, which would cost $30–40 trillion over 10 years, cannot be financed without tax hikes. Warren’s refusal to address this obvious fact makes her look less like a would-be policy wonk and more like a typical politician.But even setting aside Medicare for All, Warren’s plans are likely to dump oceans of red ink onto our growing national debt. Her non-health-care spending proposals already total some $7.5 trillion per year over the next 10 years. Although these are not quite Bernie levels of government largesse, her proposals would still require nearly double our current levels of spending.To pay for all this, Warren proposes a variety of tax hikes, mostly designed to hit corporations or high-earners: higher payroll taxes for those earning more than $250,000 per year; a 7 percent profits tax on companies earning more than $100 million; a 60 percent lobbying tax on firms that spend a million or more on lobbying, and so forth. But the biggest chunk of money would come from Warren’s proposed “wealth tax,” a 2 to 3 percent levy on net worth above $50 million. Warren estimates that this wealth tax will pull in more than $2.75 trillion over ten years. It won’t.First, there is the slight problem that a wealth tax is probably unconstitutional. Of course, constitutional constraints are quaint notions in the Age of Trump. Regardless, it is worth noting that the Constitution permits the federal government to impose only “direct taxes,” such as a property tax. That’s why it required a constitutional amendment to enact the federal income tax. Many constitutional scholars warn that a wealth tax is neither a direct tax nor income tax.Even if Warren can find a way around the constitutional guardrails -- perhaps by something such as a retrospective wealth tax in which you wait until a taxpayer sells assets or passes away -- a wealth tax is unlikely to raise anywhere near the amount of money she predicts.Simply look at Europe’s experiments with wealth taxes. At one time, a dozen European countries imposed wealth taxes. Today, all but three have abandoned those levies. Among those repealing their wealth tax are the Scandinavian social democracies that Warren admires, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Norway retains a wealth tax but has significantly reduced it in recent years. Additional countries abandoning the tax include Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Other countries, such as Great Britain, have considered wealth taxes and rejected them.They did so because wealth taxes are administratively complex and difficult to enforce. Also, they significantly reduce investment, entrepreneurship, and, ultimately, economic growth. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, European wealth taxes raised, on average, only about 0.2 percent of GDP in revenues. By comparison, the U.S. federal income tax raises 8 percent of GDP.Two groups, however, would benefit substantially from a wealth tax. The tax would be a full-employment opportunity for the tax-preparation industry and for lawyers. After all, we would now have to determine fair market value for everything from homes and vehicles to artwork and jewelry to family pension rights and intellectual property. The other big winner would be lobbyists, who could be expected to descend on Washington en masse seeking exemptions and exceptions for their clients. If you think the tax code is a mess today, just wait until D.C. is done with Warren’s plan.There is an old Yiddish proverb that goes “Mann tracht, un Gott Lacht,” or “Man plans, and God laughs.” It is all well and good that Senator Warren has a plan for everything. But until she actually figures out how to pay for everything without crippling our economy, such plans really don’t add up.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/t_XOfhQ2Q8pn0Eihbaza4g--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/710b4188b8e44ebd02c332c03dfb8d66,Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans

How did we get there?”After noting that he lives near one of the fires in the Los Angeles area, Rubin immediately took aim at liberal politics as the main reason the wildfires have grown so large and dangerous.“The problem right now is that everything, EVERYTHING, from academia to public utilities to politics, everything that goes woke, that buys into this ridiculous progressive ideology that cares about what contractors are LGBT or how many black firemen we have or white this or Asian that, everything that goes that road eventually breaks down,” he declared.As Carlson nodded and said “that’s true,” Rubin continued, complaining that this isn’t how “freedom is supposed to operate.”“What is supposed to happen—imagine if your house was on fire,” he added. “Would you care what the public utility or what the fire company, what contractor they brought in, what gender or sexuality or any of those things he or she was? It’s just absolutely ridiculous.”The Fox News host continued to agree with Rubin, who went on to tie PG&E;’s preemptive blackouts to a lack of “libertarian or conservative-minded people in California to fight what the progressives are doing to the state.”“If you can’t keep the lights on and you can’t keep the place from burning down, you’ve reached the point where there is no kind of lying about it anymore,” Carlson concluded. “It’s falling apart.

NYC Medical Examiner Dismisses Epstein ‘Homicide’ Claim by Dr. Michael Baden,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 15:28:10 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/nyc-medical-examiner-dismisses-epstein-192810863.html,"Robyn Beck/ReutersNew York City’s chief medical examiner pushed back hard Wednesday against a celebrity pathologist-for-hire’s conspiracy-stirring claim that Jeffrey Epstein’s autopsy was more consistent with homicide than suicide.“The original medical investigation was thorough and complete. There is no reason for a second medical investigation by our office,” said Dr. Barbara Sampson.Sampson determined Epstein died by suicide from hanging in his jail cell in August, while he was awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.Epstein’s lawyers and family have refused to accept her finding, and the disgraced financier’s brother hired Dr. Michael Baden—erstwhile host of HBO’s Autopsy—to do his own investigation.Jeffrey Epstein’s Death Ruled Suicide by Hanging: New York City Medical ExaminerDuring an appearance Wednesday morning on Fox News, where he is a contributor, Baden said his own review isn’t complete but nonetheless suggested that suicide isn’t the cause of death.He claimed a collection of neck fractures in Epstein’s hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage “are extremely unusual in suicidal hangings and could occur much more commonly in homicidal strangulation.”“I’ve not seen in 50 years where that occurred in a suicidal hanging case,” Baden said.Although more common in homicidal strangulation cases, some studies have found that hyoid and thyroid fractures are not rare in suicidal hangings.A 2000 study in Australia found fractures in nearly half the 40 suicide cases it examined and said they were even more common in older victims and men; in fact, 15 percent had fractures of both the hyoid and the thyroid. And a 2010 study out of Thailand found such fractures in 25 percent of the confirmed suicides it reviewed.After His Suicide Watch Ended, Jeffrey Epstein Was Left to Look After HimselfBaden, who observed the autopsy performed by Sampson, served briefly as the city’s chief medical examiner before being fired in 1979 by then-Mayor Ed Koch in response to a complaint that he told doctors during a guest-speaking event that Gov. Nelson Rockefeller had died during sexual intercourse.Three years later, he was dismissed as chief deputy medical examiner by Suffolk County, New York, over a magazine article about ways to kill that wouldn’t show up in an autopsy; he protested that he was misquoted.In the '70s, Baden helped Congress investigate the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.—he concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald and James Earl Ray, respectively, were the killers—but became famous for serving as a private pathologist in high-profile cases like the Aaron Hernandez suicide, the O.J. Simpson murder trial, and the Jayson Williams shooting. He also served as a defense witness in the Phil Spector murder trial, where he reportedly testified that he had no conflict of interest in the case even though his wife was heading Spector’s legal team.Baden isn’t the only one skeptical about the official account of Epstein’s death at the high-security federal lockup in Manhattan, which is currently the subject of a Justice Department probe.Spencer Kuvin, a lawyer representing victims of Epstein, said serious questions remain, including the whereabouts of the guards assigned to monitor him, why the cameras outside his cell apparently didn’t work, and why he was taken off suicide watch.“It all makes no sense. Until they come out with the evidence, I don’t believe anything they’re telling us,” Kuvin said. “Exactly what happened I can’t tell you, but I certainly don’t believe the story they’re trying to feed everyone.”Sigrid McCawley, an attorney at Boies Schiller Flexner, the law firm representing some of Epstein’s victims, said the ongoing Justice Department probe “limits what can and should be said at this time.”“But as the public has come to to understand the horrifying scope and scale of the international sex trafficking system he operated for decades with impunity, what really matters for the brave survivors who are seeking justice is how he lived, not how he died,” she said. “That is how the man should be judged.”Kuvin said his clients are “more interested in seeing co-conspirators prosecuted” than in delving into Epstein autopsy theories.“The justice system failed. They either allowed him to take his own life or someone got in there and killed him,” Kuvin told The Daily Beast. “Either way, it’s a failure of the Justice Department… [which] has failed them repeatedly over the last 13 years. This was just one more time.”If you or a loved one are struggling with suicidal thoughts, please reach out to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), or contact the Crisis Text Line by texting TALK to 741741Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

"Former &lt;/&gt;Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:11:25 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/former-time-editor-wants-hate-211125098.html,"A former Time editor claimed that the United States needs a law banning hate speech, and that President Donald Trump “might be in violation of it” if there were one -- because, apparently, he doesn’t notice the irony of holding both of these views at once.In a Tuesday tweet promoting his Washington Post piece, titled “Why America needs a hate speech law,” Richard Stengel stated:> My @WashingtonPost piece on why the very broadness of the First Amendment suggests we should have a hate speech law. And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f> > -- Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019In the piece, Stengel writes that “many nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred” in the wake of World War II:> These laws started out as protections against the kinds of anti-Semitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws, but there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general, hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.“I’m all for protecting ‘thought that we hate,’ but not speech that incites hate,” he continues. “It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.”It’s interesting how Stengel actually does acknowledge the fact that “there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is,” and yet he still wants laws banning it. This makes absolutely no sense. After all, when he calls for laws to ban “hate speech,” he is, inherently, giving the government the power to decide what would and would not qualify -- the exact same government that is led by Donald Trump, and that is full of people who support him.In other words: Stengel somehow trusts that the government will have the same view of “hate speech” as he does, and then, in the same thought, seems to acknowledge that there’s actually no way that many of them would. Unless he thinks that the president and his congressional supporters would actually pass a law that they’d be in violation of, his argument for “hate speech” laws winds up being a pretty great argument against them.It’s ironic, but it’s not new: More often than not, it’s the uber-progressives arguing for laws against “hate speech” -- despite the fact that they’re often the same people who are also arguing that Donald Trump and Republicans are constantly spewing it. Maybe it’s just me, but if I thought that the leader of my government was, you know, literally Hitler or whatever, the last thing that I’d want would be to give that person and their supporters control over my speech.Yes, the First Amendment gives us the right to be “offensive” with our speech. Given the fact that a new thing seems to be declared “racist” or “sexist” every day, I’m certainly glad that we do have this protection. After all, it would only take there being a few too many of the “super woke” in our government for a phrase like “you guys” to become a criminal offense.The truth is, though, the right to be “offensive” (however you define that subjective term, anyway) is not even the most important role that our First Amendment plays. No, what’s most important is that it protects our right to speak out against the government when we see fit -- without having to worry about its retaliation. Like it or not, the only way to ensure that we retain this important check on government power is to never (ever) give its leaders a vehicle take it away.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eTNessteMBpuBTcqmJGuYw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/bae9af12e23cce197b317b5c1be56053,"Former </>Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony"

"More than 1,000 homeless people died in Los Angeles county last year","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 16:20:14 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/homeless-deaths-la-county-double-202014816.html,"The county’s public health department has reported 1,047 deaths for last year, a number that has increased steadily since 2013A woman pushes a cart full of her belongings past tents near Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles. Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty ImagesMore than 1,000 homeless people died in Los Angeles county in 2018, double the number of deaths from six years ago. The increase is a stark illustration of the region’s severe housing crisis, advocates said.The LA county public health department reported this week that 1,047 homeless people died last year, a number that has steadily increased every year since 2013, when 536 people died. The leading causes of death were coronary heart disease, which accounted for 22% of deaths, followed by alcohol and drug overdose at 21%, transportation-related injuries at 9%, homicides at 6% and suicides at 5%.The data sheds light on a worsening public health emergency in the county, where officials estimate there are now 59,000 people homeless, including more than 44,000 people who are living unsheltered – in cars, tents, or makeshift quarters. The report also follows a string of high-profile attacks against homeless people in the area, including the killing of Darrell Fields, a beloved musician who was burned to death in his tent on Skid Row.“We’ve got three people a day dying on the streets,” said Adam Rice, an organizer with Los Angeles Community Action Network (LA Can), a group that had worked closely with Fields. “It is a complete failure of leadership. Darrell didn’t need to die. None of these people needed to die. The reason this is happening is because there’s not proper housing.”Darrell Fields, 62, was a homeless man in Los Angeles known as Mr Guitar. He was killed in August when his tent was set ablaze. Photograph: Los Angeles Community Action NetworkSoaring rents and a major shortage of affordable housing have pushed people out of their homes in the area, with more than half of unsheltered adults in a recent count saying they were experiencing homelessness for the first time. The county estimated that there are now 8,800 homeless families.“It brings an overwhelming sadness when you think about precious human beings dying in our streets when it can be avoided,” said the Rev Andy Bales, CEO of Union Rescue Mission (URM), which runs a shelter at Skid Row, at the epicenter of the crisis in downtown LA.The county’s analysis also found that the mortality rate among homeless people has also jumped: “Put simply, being homeless in LA county is becoming increasingly deadly,” the agency wrote.The increase in overdoses represented the largest jump in terms of causes of death, the report found. In addition, the mortality rate among white homeless people has decreased while the rate of deaths for black and Latino residents has increased, the county said. Overall, African Americans are four times more likely to experience homelessness in LA county than other groups.Of the transportation-related deaths, which include vehicle and train collisions, 82% of victims were pedestrians and cyclists.The county and local clinics have increasingly sent healthcare workers to encampments to try to serve people on the streets. More than 21,000 homeless people were also placed in housing last year, an increase from 2017, officials reported early this year.The health department report this week recommended more direct outreach to homeless people, the creation of a “death review team” to study the subject and more traffic safety measures near encampments.Bales predicted that medical visits were not enough to reverse the deadly trends: “What we need most is for everyone to be immediately under a roof and protected from the elements. Until that happens, the death rates will continue to grow … and more and more people will be devastated by homelessness.”The crisis demanded a more urgent response, he added: “How much evidence do we need to gather before we decide not to let another human being die on the street?”LA’s homeless crisis has recently received national attention, with the Trump administration suggesting it could pursue some kind of law enforcement crackdown, drawing skepticism from some local organizations. Advocates have criticized efforts to further criminalize people living on the streets and have argued that the government needs to put more funding to housing and shelter.“It’s really a travesty when you think about it. How many deaths could’ve been prevented?” said Kourtney Milligan, a 29-year-old homeless woman, who has lived on Skid Row. “The resources that they say are out there are so hard to find.”",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/s2XrfBGfKBrVbz9mGlm7bg--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/f15aa3ae803200f5d01035f9967bdb02,"More than 1,000 homeless people died in Los Angeles county last year"

"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:17:36 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/record-wave-lone-child-migrants-122133758.html,"TENOSIQUE, Mexico -- The United States has detained more children trying to cross the nation's southwest border on their own over the last year than during any other period on record, surpassing the surge of unaccompanied minors that set off a crisis during the Obama administration, according to new figures released Tuesday.U.S. immigration authorities apprehended 76,020 minors, most of them from Central America, traveling without their parents in the fiscal year that ended in September -- 52% more than during the last fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Mexico is experiencing the same surge. Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period -- pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.In interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous -- and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.""These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,"" Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters. ""And each month during the fiscal year, the numbers increased. You saw them. We all saw them.""The young migrants came alongside a historic wave of families traveling together, also largely from Central America. They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.Marvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced -- and he pressed on.""Quitting was not an option,"" Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. ""You wipe your tears and carry on.""For the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they'd kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.His parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said. ""We can't bear losing another son,"" they told him. ""You have to go.""He left home in the spring, with $40 in his pocket and no plan except to find work in a safer place.As for most underage migrants traveling without their parents, his trip north has been a feat of improvisation and courage. He walked and hitchhiked through Honduras and Guatemala. He slept in churches, under trees or wherever he found himself when night fell.Along the way, he gathered crucial bits of information from fellow migrants: the best route to take, locations of shelters up ahead, places to avoid, where to forage for food.As huge numbers of young migrants from Central America began arriving at the United States' southern border in 2014, the Obama administration scrambled to house them until they could be released to sponsors -- adults who applied to care for them. The shelter system grew dramatically as a result.The Trump administration experienced similar backups at the border just a few years later -- this time because of new, more stringent policies that made the sponsors themselves, who are often undocumented, vulnerable to immigration authorities. This discouraged people from coming forward, leaving thousands of children to languish in the system.The Trump administration has also sought to deter migration by separating thousands of children from their relatives, again driving up the number of children in federally contracted shelters.On the road, while trying to avoid detention, fear and hunger are constant companions for many young migrants.With little or no money in their pockets, they relied on strangers for snacks or meals. They pawed through garbage and scanned drifts of debris on the roadside, hoping to spot an edible morsel.Wilson, a 17-year-old Honduran, said he had feasted on rotten mangos discarded by street vendors.""I used to drink water from potholes when I was too thirsty,"" interjected Mario Leonel, 16, who left home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, several weeks ago without notifying his parents. ""That is the hardest part of it all: the hunger.""When he arrived at the shelter in Tenosique, a small Mexican town near the Guatemala border, he called his parents in Honduras, who burst into tears and pleaded for him to return. He said no. He was tired of all the violence in his country, and wanted to get asylum in the United States.After Marvel slipped across the Guatemala-Mexico border in May, he found room at a shelter in Tenosique, which serves as a transit point for many migrants. He quickly made new friends among other teenage migrants who had made it this far, mainly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador.On a recent afternoon, several of them gathered in a two-story building that had been reserved for minors, its walls painted with colorful animal murals. The boys cracked jokes, roughhoused and argued about who was the cutest girl in the shelter.Outside, Dulce, a 16-year-old transgender migrant from Guatemala, sat alone on train tracks pining for a boy she had met at the shelter. He had left without explanation and she was lovesick.""I just can't get him out of my mind,"" she said.She left her hometown four months earlier to escape abuse from her family and strangers, including a sexual assault by gang members when she was 12. She made it as far as central Mexico before being detained and deported. Five days after returning home, she set off again.""I left because I had nothing there and no one to protect me,"" she said. ""At least here I am safe.""Though the United States remains the destination of choice for most unaccompanied minors, an increasing number are setting their sights no farther than Mexico, advocates and migrants say.Sometimes they have no choice: Mexico's increased enforcement measures have made it more difficult for migrants to make it to the border with the United States. And even if they reach the United States, recent policies have drastically lowered the possibilities of getting asylum.In Mexico, when unaccompanied minors are detained, the law mandates that they be released right away into the custody of the national child protection agency, which finds them accommodation in shelters designed for children.But migrants' advocates say the government has been holding children in the nation's overcrowded detention centers for far too long, and that some children are quickly funneled into the deportation process rather than being given a fair chance to seek asylum or some other form of relief.""No child should ever be held at a detention center,"" said Elba Coria, a migration expert from the Clinic for Refugees at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City. ""But while international standards consider children's detention as an exceptional measure, amid Mexico's migration chaos, it is the rule.""Neither Marvel nor any of his new friends in the Tenosique shelter had been detained by the authorities. All had managed to cross into Mexico from Guatemala and had applied for asylum in Mexico after talking through their options with the shelter staff.They now plan to remain in Mexico and look for work and study opportunities -- even if they haven't abandoned hope of making it to the United States.""It is every Honduran's boy dream to get to the United States, where there is more money and kids are able to go to school,"" said Jose Angel, 17. He was born with a disability that left him unable to use his arms and left his hometown because his grandmother could no longer take care of him.He was hopeful he could apply for asylum in the United States despite Trump's many efforts to severely lower the number of people granted asylum. ""It is scary, but you have to take a chance,"" he said.On a recent morning, Alan, a 17-year-old Guatemalan migrant, sat on the sidewalk outside a migrant shelter in the city of Palenque, in southern Mexico. He had just crossed the border and was exhausted. Mexican immigration officials had stopped a bus he was on, but he managed to escape into the countryside and hide.Alan planned to take a nap, shower and have a meal before trying illegally to board a freight train known as The Beast. It runs from Mexico's border with Guatemala to its border with the United States and, for decades, migrants have clung to it to speed through much of Mexico.His hope was to make it to the U.S. border and petition for asylum. He was undeterred by Trump's recent efforts to restrict asylum claims or curb immigration.""One way or another, I have to make it to the other side where there are skyscrapers and life is better,"" he said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5ol82jExNHqBHa7IGzz2mw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/03f35d3f9d537a8dc9fe503d06c098de,"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation"
Denmark Snubs Trump With Approval of Russian Gas Pipe to Europe,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 14:14:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/denmark-snubs-trump-approval-russian-141104626.html,"(Bloomberg) -- In a major boost for Russia’s effort to tighten its grip over natural gas supplies to western Europe, Denmark said it will allow the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline to pass through its territory.The decision removes the last important hurdle for the $11 billion project, which is slated for commissioning by the end of this year and bolster gas flows from Siberia into Germany. The link has drawn the threat of sanctions from the U.S., which wants Europe to buy its liquefied natural gas. It risks reigniting a feud between Donald Trump and Danish lawmakers that erupted in the summer after the U.S. president’s offer to buy Greenland.Russian President Vladimir Putin welcomed the pipeline decision. “Denmark showed itself to be a responsible participant in international relations, defending its interests and sovereignty and the interests of its main partners in Europe,” he told a briefing in Budapest, where he was on a visit.The green light gives Gazprom PJSC, Russia’s gas export champion and already Europe’s biggest supplier, yet another route to one of the world’s most liquid gas markets. While Trump has accused Russia of using its natural gas as a political weapon, it’s ultimately a commercial deal over which Washington has little influence, according to Raffaello Pantucci, Director of Security Studies at the Royal United Services Institute in London.“It’s frankly too far advanced,” Pantucci said. “Who are they going to sanction?”The approval also gives Russia more clout in ongoing talks with Ukraine on a new gas transit deal, increasing the risk of a disruption from Jan. 1. Uncertainty about whether those two nations can agree on time has been weighing on forward prices in Europe and sending incentives for traders to stockpile gas as a cushion against disruption.“If Gazprom are confident in Nord Stream 2’s imminent completion, it may encourage a tougher negotiating stance on any new Ukrainian transit deal,” said John Twomey, a gas analyst at BloombergNEF in London. “If anything, the risks of a disruption on Jan. 1 have gone up as a result of this.”The pipeline has divided EU governments, with nations led by Poland concerned about the bloc’s increasing dependence on Russian gas.“It is not too late to stop NS2,” an official at the U.S. embassy in Germany said. “There are clear negative energy security and geopolitical implications for Europe from Putin’s pipeline. The U.S. government agrees with the European Parliament, the U.S. House and nearly 20 European countries in our opposition to NS2.”Russia, Ukraine, Europe Pledge New Gas Deal by Year-EndDenmark said on Wednesday it will allow the pipeline to pass southeast of the island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea. The company behind the pipeline submitted the route plan in April. Denmark had been conducting a security and environmental review of the project.Trump had objected to the link, instead urging the European Union to diversify the sources of its energy and dilute Putin’s economic influence over the region. U.S. officials have also warned that project partners are at an elevated risk of U.S. sanctions.The approval is another snub of Trump by the Nordic country after it ruled out his proposal to buy Greenland this summer. The president responded by canceling a state visit to Denmark.The Danish approval covers 147 kilometers (91 miles) of the project. Nord Stream 2 said in its statement that it has already completed 87%, or 2,100 kilometers, of the pipeline in Russian, Finnish and Swedish waters as well as most of the German part. Dan Jorgensen, Denmark’s minister for climate, energy and utilities, declined to comment on Wednesday.Nord Stream 2 said it will continue its “constructive cooperation with the Danish authorities to complete the pipeline.”Six WeeksGazprom CEO Alexey Miller said that the pipeline is expected to be completed on time by the end of the year. “The remaining 147 kilometers -- that’s five weeks of work,” Miller told reporters in Budapest.A statement from the company highlighted some uncertainties in that timetable. Nord Stream 2 said Wednesday the actual start of the construction depends on a number of legal, technical and environmental factors, which will “take a few weeks” and the project aims for completion “in the coming months.”Gazprom can’t use the permit for the next four weeks when all involved parties have leeway to make a complaint under Danish law. Those issues left analysts anticipating some delay beyond Jan. 1 for the completion of the link.“It’s unlikely that Nord Stream 2 is online in time for Jan. 1, so Ukrainian transit disruption risks remains,” said Twomey.While Gazprom owns the pipeline, half the financing of the 8 billion-euro capital cost comes from five European companies: Uniper SE and Wintershall of Germany, OMV AG of Austria, Engie SA of France and Royal Dutch Shell Plc.Dutch gas for the first quarter declined to the lowest since at least 2017 as the region is oversupplied with the fuel, storage sites across Europe are full, and LNG imports surge.(Updates with Putin comment in third paragraph.)\--With assistance from Dina Khrennikova, Vanessa Dezem and Ilya Arkhipov.To contact the reporters on this story: Morten Buttler in Copenhagen at mbuttler@bloomberg.net;William Wilkes in Frankfurt at wwilkes1@bloomberg.net;Anna Shiryaevskaya in London at ashiryaevska@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Christian Wienberg at cwienberg@bloomberg.net, ;Tasneem Hanfi Brögger at tbrogger@bloomberg.net, ;Nick Rigillo at nrigillo@bloomberg.net, Gregory L.

Meghan McCain Spars With Cory Booker Over Civility: Beto Was ‘Very Nasty’ to Me!,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:39:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/meghan-mccain-spars-cory-booker-163901660.html,"During a Wednesday interview with Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, The View’s Meghan McCain did what she apparently does best: Make the conversation about herself and, in this case, her personal beef with a presidential hopeful.After applauding Booker for saying Medicare for All is unrealistic, the conservative View co-host took issue with the New Jersey senator’s support for mandatory gun buybacks. This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he’s going to take her brother’s guns.After a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they’d continue the conversation in the next segment.“No we’re not,” McCain grumbled. “It’s fine.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 10:05:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-warren-untenable-plans-140521979.html,"If you’ve been having trouble finding someone to walk your dog, don’t worry. Any day now, Elizabeth Warren will announce “a plan for that.” It will undoubtedly be comprehensive, detailed, and replete with subsidies for lower- and middle-class dog walkers and underserved breeds. It will cost tens of billions of dollars and will receive widespread positive notice from the media. However, to judge by her other recent plans, the one thing it won’t include is any discussion of how she plans to pay for it.The Massachusetts senator has challenged and possibly overtaken former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, largely based on having a plan for the government to tackle every problem facing this country, no matter how big or how small, from issues with military housing to Puerto Rican debt to climate change.The price tag for this massive expansion of government is enormous. Much of the attention in recent weeks has been focused on Warren’s embrace of Medicare for All, which she refuses to admit would require an increase in middle-class taxes. Even Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has conceded that such proposals, which would cost $30–40 trillion over 10 years, cannot be financed without tax hikes. Warren’s refusal to address this obvious fact makes her look less like a would-be policy wonk and more like a typical politician.But even setting aside Medicare for All, Warren’s plans are likely to dump oceans of red ink onto our growing national debt. Her non-health-care spending proposals already total some $7.5 trillion per year over the next 10 years. Although these are not quite Bernie levels of government largesse, her proposals would still require nearly double our current levels of spending.To pay for all this, Warren proposes a variety of tax hikes, mostly designed to hit corporations or high-earners: higher payroll taxes for those earning more than $250,000 per year; a 7 percent profits tax on companies earning more than $100 million; a 60 percent lobbying tax on firms that spend a million or more on lobbying, and so forth. But the biggest chunk of money would come from Warren’s proposed “wealth tax,” a 2 to 3 percent levy on net worth above $50 million. Warren estimates that this wealth tax will pull in more than $2.75 trillion over ten years. It won’t.First, there is the slight problem that a wealth tax is probably unconstitutional. Of course, constitutional constraints are quaint notions in the Age of Trump. Regardless, it is worth noting that the Constitution permits the federal government to impose only “direct taxes,” such as a property tax. That’s why it required a constitutional amendment to enact the federal income tax. Many constitutional scholars warn that a wealth tax is neither a direct tax nor income tax.Even if Warren can find a way around the constitutional guardrails -- perhaps by something such as a retrospective wealth tax in which you wait until a taxpayer sells assets or passes away -- a wealth tax is unlikely to raise anywhere near the amount of money she predicts.Simply look at Europe’s experiments with wealth taxes. At one time, a dozen European countries imposed wealth taxes. Today, all but three have abandoned those levies. Among those repealing their wealth tax are the Scandinavian social democracies that Warren admires, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Norway retains a wealth tax but has significantly reduced it in recent years. Additional countries abandoning the tax include Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Other countries, such as Great Britain, have considered wealth taxes and rejected them.They did so because wealth taxes are administratively complex and difficult to enforce. Also, they significantly reduce investment, entrepreneurship, and, ultimately, economic growth. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, European wealth taxes raised, on average, only about 0.2 percent of GDP in revenues. By comparison, the U.S. federal income tax raises 8 percent of GDP.Two groups, however, would benefit substantially from a wealth tax. The tax would be a full-employment opportunity for the tax-preparation industry and for lawyers. After all, we would now have to determine fair market value for everything from homes and vehicles to artwork and jewelry to family pension rights and intellectual property. The other big winner would be lobbyists, who could be expected to descend on Washington en masse seeking exemptions and exceptions for their clients. If you think the tax code is a mess today, just wait until D.C. is done with Warren’s plan.There is an old Yiddish proverb that goes “Mann tracht, un Gott Lacht,” or “Man plans, and God laughs.” It is all well and good that Senator Warren has a plan for everything. But until she actually figures out how to pay for everything without crippling our economy, such plans really don’t add up.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/t_XOfhQ2Q8pn0Eihbaza4g--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/710b4188b8e44ebd02c332c03dfb8d66,Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans

Tucker Carlson and Guest Blame Diversity and ‘Woke’ Culture for California Fires,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 07:17:19 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/tucker-carlson-guest-blame-diversity-032855316.html,"Fox NewsFox News host Tucker Carlson and his guest, conservative YouTube personality Dave Rubin, both insisted Tuesday night that the wildfires burning across California are due largely to progressive ideology, “woke” culture, and diversity in hiring.During Tuesday’s broadcast of Tucker Carlson Tonight, Carlson welcomed on Rubin, a political commentator and podcaster, to discuss the issues surrounding the large fires engulfing the state, including those related to the electrical grid and firefighting methods.“PG&E; strikes me as almost a metaphor for the destruction of the state,” Carlson said about the state’s power company. “Here’s the utility which doesn’t really know anything about its own infrastructure but knows everything about the race of its employees. How did we get there?”After noting that he lives near one of the fires in the Los Angeles area, Rubin immediately took aim at liberal politics as the main reason the wildfires have grown so large and dangerous.“The problem right now is that everything, EVERYTHING, from academia to public utilities to politics, everything that goes woke, that buys into this ridiculous progressive ideology that cares about what contractors are LGBT or how many black firemen we have or white this or Asian that, everything that goes that road eventually breaks down,” he declared.As Carlson nodded and said “that’s true,” Rubin continued, complaining that this isn’t how “freedom is supposed to operate.”“What is supposed to happen—imagine if your house was on fire,” he added. “Would you care what the public utility or what the fire company, what contractor they brought in, what gender or sexuality or any of those things he or she was? It’s just absolutely ridiculous.”The Fox News host continued to agree with Rubin, who went on to tie PG&E;’s preemptive blackouts to a lack of “libertarian or conservative-minded people in California to fight what the progressives are doing to the state.”“If you can’t keep the lights on and you can’t keep the place from burning down, you’ve reached the point where there is no kind of lying about it anymore,” Carlson concluded. “It’s falling apart.

"Former &lt;/&gt;Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:11:25 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/former-time-editor-wants-hate-211125098.html,"A former Time editor claimed that the United States needs a law banning hate speech, and that President Donald Trump “might be in violation of it” if there were one -- because, apparently, he doesn’t notice the irony of holding both of these views at once.In a Tuesday tweet promoting his Washington Post piece, titled “Why America needs a hate speech law,” Richard Stengel stated:> My @WashingtonPost piece on why the very broadness of the First Amendment suggests we should have a hate speech law. And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f> > -- Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019In the piece, Stengel writes that “many nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred” in the wake of World War II:> These laws started out as protections against the kinds of anti-Semitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws, but there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general, hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.“I’m all for protecting ‘thought that we hate,’ but not speech that incites hate,” he continues. “It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.”It’s interesting how Stengel actually does acknowledge the fact that “there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is,” and yet he still wants laws banning it. This makes absolutely no sense. After all, when he calls for laws to ban “hate speech,” he is, inherently, giving the government the power to decide what would and would not qualify -- the exact same government that is led by Donald Trump, and that is full of people who support him.In other words: Stengel somehow trusts that the government will have the same view of “hate speech” as he does, and then, in the same thought, seems to acknowledge that there’s actually no way that many of them would. Unless he thinks that the president and his congressional supporters would actually pass a law that they’d be in violation of, his argument for “hate speech” laws winds up being a pretty great argument against them.It’s ironic, but it’s not new: More often than not, it’s the uber-progressives arguing for laws against “hate speech” -- despite the fact that they’re often the same people who are also arguing that Donald Trump and Republicans are constantly spewing it. Maybe it’s just me, but if I thought that the leader of my government was, you know, literally Hitler or whatever, the last thing that I’d want would be to give that person and their supporters control over my speech.Yes, the First Amendment gives us the right to be “offensive” with our speech. Given the fact that a new thing seems to be declared “racist” or “sexist” every day, I’m certainly glad that we do have this protection. After all, it would only take there being a few too many of the “super woke” in our government for a phrase like “you guys” to become a criminal offense.The truth is, though, the right to be “offensive” (however you define that subjective term, anyway) is not even the most important role that our First Amendment plays. No, what’s most important is that it protects our right to speak out against the government when we see fit -- without having to worry about its retaliation. Like it or not, the only way to ensure that we retain this important check on government power is to never (ever) give its leaders a vehicle take it away.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eTNessteMBpuBTcqmJGuYw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/bae9af12e23cce197b317b5c1be56053,"Former </>Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony"

NYC Medical Examiner Dismisses Epstein ‘Homicide’ Claim by Dr. Michael Baden,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 15:28:10 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/nyc-medical-examiner-dismisses-epstein-192810863.html,"Robyn Beck/ReutersNew York City’s chief medical examiner pushed back hard Wednesday against a celebrity pathologist-for-hire’s conspiracy-stirring claim that Jeffrey Epstein’s autopsy was more consistent with homicide than suicide.“The original medical investigation was thorough and complete. There is no reason for a second medical investigation by our office,” said Dr. Barbara Sampson.Sampson determined Epstein died by suicide from hanging in his jail cell in August, while he was awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.Epstein’s lawyers and family have refused to accept her finding, and the disgraced financier’s brother hired Dr. Michael Baden—erstwhile host of HBO’s Autopsy—to do his own investigation.Jeffrey Epstein’s Death Ruled Suicide by Hanging: New York City Medical ExaminerDuring an appearance Wednesday morning on Fox News, where he is a contributor, Baden said his own review isn’t complete but nonetheless suggested that suicide isn’t the cause of death.He claimed a collection of neck fractures in Epstein’s hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage “are extremely unusual in suicidal hangings and could occur much more commonly in homicidal strangulation.”“I’ve not seen in 50 years where that occurred in a suicidal hanging case,” Baden said.Although more common in homicidal strangulation cases, some studies have found that hyoid and thyroid fractures are not rare in suicidal hangings.A 2000 study in Australia found fractures in nearly half the 40 suicide cases it examined and said they were even more common in older victims and men; in fact, 15 percent had fractures of both the hyoid and the thyroid. And a 2010 study out of Thailand found such fractures in 25 percent of the confirmed suicides it reviewed.After His Suicide Watch Ended, Jeffrey Epstein Was Left to Look After HimselfBaden, who observed the autopsy performed by Sampson, served briefly as the city’s chief medical examiner before being fired in 1979 by then-Mayor Ed Koch in response to a complaint that he told doctors during a guest-speaking event that Gov. Nelson Rockefeller had died during sexual intercourse.Three years later, he was dismissed as chief deputy medical examiner by Suffolk County, New York, over a magazine article about ways to kill that wouldn’t show up in an autopsy; he protested that he was misquoted.In the '70s, Baden helped Congress investigate the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.—he concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald and James Earl Ray, respectively, were the killers—but became famous for serving as a private pathologist in high-profile cases like the Aaron Hernandez suicide, the O.J. Simpson murder trial, and the Jayson Williams shooting. He also served as a defense witness in the Phil Spector murder trial, where he reportedly testified that he had no conflict of interest in the case even though his wife was heading Spector’s legal team.Baden isn’t the only one skeptical about the official account of Epstein’s death at the high-security federal lockup in Manhattan, which is currently the subject of a Justice Department probe.Spencer Kuvin, a lawyer representing victims of Epstein, said serious questions remain, including the whereabouts of the guards assigned to monitor him, why the cameras outside his cell apparently didn’t work, and why he was taken off suicide watch.“It all makes no sense. Until they come out with the evidence, I don’t believe anything they’re telling us,” Kuvin said. “Exactly what happened I can’t tell you, but I certainly don’t believe the story they’re trying to feed everyone.”Sigrid McCawley, an attorney at Boies Schiller Flexner, the law firm representing some of Epstein’s victims, said the ongoing Justice Department probe “limits what can and should be said at this time.”“But as the public has come to to understand the horrifying scope and scale of the international sex trafficking system he operated for decades with impunity, what really matters for the brave survivors who are seeking justice is how he lived, not how he died,” she said. “That is how the man should be judged.”Kuvin said his clients are “more interested in seeing co-conspirators prosecuted” than in delving into Epstein autopsy theories.“The justice system failed. They either allowed him to take his own life or someone got in there and killed him,” Kuvin told The Daily Beast. “Either way, it’s a failure of the Justice Department… [which] has failed them repeatedly over the last 13 years. This was just one more time.”If you or a loved one are struggling with suicidal thoughts, please reach out to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), or contact the Crisis Text Line by texting TALK to 741741Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:17:36 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/record-wave-lone-child-migrants-122133758.html,"TENOSIQUE, Mexico -- The United States has detained more children trying to cross the nation's southwest border on their own over the last year than during any other period on record, surpassing the surge of unaccompanied minors that set off a crisis during the Obama administration, according to new figures released Tuesday.U.S. immigration authorities apprehended 76,020 minors, most of them from Central America, traveling without their parents in the fiscal year that ended in September -- 52% more than during the last fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Mexico is experiencing the same surge. Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period -- pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.In interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous -- and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.""These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,"" Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters. ""And each month during the fiscal year, the numbers increased. You saw them. We all saw them.""The young migrants came alongside a historic wave of families traveling together, also largely from Central America. They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.Marvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced -- and he pressed on.""Quitting was not an option,"" Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. ""You wipe your tears and carry on.""For the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they'd kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.His parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said. ""We can't bear losing another son,"" they told him. ""You have to go.""He left home in the spring, with $40 in his pocket and no plan except to find work in a safer place.As for most underage migrants traveling without their parents, his trip north has been a feat of improvisation and courage. He walked and hitchhiked through Honduras and Guatemala. He slept in churches, under trees or wherever he found himself when night fell.Along the way, he gathered crucial bits of information from fellow migrants: the best route to take, locations of shelters up ahead, places to avoid, where to forage for food.As huge numbers of young migrants from Central America began arriving at the United States' southern border in 2014, the Obama administration scrambled to house them until they could be released to sponsors -- adults who applied to care for them. The shelter system grew dramatically as a result.The Trump administration experienced similar backups at the border just a few years later -- this time because of new, more stringent policies that made the sponsors themselves, who are often undocumented, vulnerable to immigration authorities. This discouraged people from coming forward, leaving thousands of children to languish in the system.The Trump administration has also sought to deter migration by separating thousands of children from their relatives, again driving up the number of children in federally contracted shelters.On the road, while trying to avoid detention, fear and hunger are constant companions for many young migrants.With little or no money in their pockets, they relied on strangers for snacks or meals. They pawed through garbage and scanned drifts of debris on the roadside, hoping to spot an edible morsel.Wilson, a 17-year-old Honduran, said he had feasted on rotten mangos discarded by street vendors.""I used to drink water from potholes when I was too thirsty,"" interjected Mario Leonel, 16, who left home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, several weeks ago without notifying his parents. ""That is the hardest part of it all: the hunger.""When he arrived at the shelter in Tenosique, a small Mexican town near the Guatemala border, he called his parents in Honduras, who burst into tears and pleaded for him to return. He said no. He was tired of all the violence in his country, and wanted to get asylum in the United States.After Marvel slipped across the Guatemala-Mexico border in May, he found room at a shelter in Tenosique, which serves as a transit point for many migrants. He quickly made new friends among other teenage migrants who had made it this far, mainly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador.On a recent afternoon, several of them gathered in a two-story building that had been reserved for minors, its walls painted with colorful animal murals. The boys cracked jokes, roughhoused and argued about who was the cutest girl in the shelter.Outside, Dulce, a 16-year-old transgender migrant from Guatemala, sat alone on train tracks pining for a boy she had met at the shelter. He had left without explanation and she was lovesick.""I just can't get him out of my mind,"" she said.She left her hometown four months earlier to escape abuse from her family and strangers, including a sexual assault by gang members when she was 12. She made it as far as central Mexico before being detained and deported. Five days after returning home, she set off again.""I left because I had nothing there and no one to protect me,"" she said. ""At least here I am safe.""Though the United States remains the destination of choice for most unaccompanied minors, an increasing number are setting their sights no farther than Mexico, advocates and migrants say.Sometimes they have no choice: Mexico's increased enforcement measures have made it more difficult for migrants to make it to the border with the United States. And even if they reach the United States, recent policies have drastically lowered the possibilities of getting asylum.In Mexico, when unaccompanied minors are detained, the law mandates that they be released right away into the custody of the national child protection agency, which finds them accommodation in shelters designed for children.But migrants' advocates say the government has been holding children in the nation's overcrowded detention centers for far too long, and that some children are quickly funneled into the deportation process rather than being given a fair chance to seek asylum or some other form of relief.""No child should ever be held at a detention center,"" said Elba Coria, a migration expert from the Clinic for Refugees at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City. ""But while international standards consider children's detention as an exceptional measure, amid Mexico's migration chaos, it is the rule.""Neither Marvel nor any of his new friends in the Tenosique shelter had been detained by the authorities. All had managed to cross into Mexico from Guatemala and had applied for asylum in Mexico after talking through their options with the shelter staff.They now plan to remain in Mexico and look for work and study opportunities -- even if they haven't abandoned hope of making it to the United States.""It is every Honduran's boy dream to get to the United States, where there is more money and kids are able to go to school,"" said Jose Angel, 17. He was born with a disability that left him unable to use his arms and left his hometown because his grandmother could no longer take care of him.He was hopeful he could apply for asylum in the United States despite Trump's many efforts to severely lower the number of people granted asylum. ""It is scary, but you have to take a chance,"" he said.On a recent morning, Alan, a 17-year-old Guatemalan migrant, sat on the sidewalk outside a migrant shelter in the city of Palenque, in southern Mexico. He had just crossed the border and was exhausted. Mexican immigration officials had stopped a bus he was on, but he managed to escape into the countryside and hide.Alan planned to take a nap, shower and have a meal before trying illegally to board a freight train known as The Beast.

Denmark Snubs Trump With Approval of Russian Gas Pipe to Europe,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 14:14:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/denmark-snubs-trump-approval-russian-141104626.html,"(Bloomberg) -- In a major boost for Russia’s effort to tighten its grip over natural gas supplies to western Europe, Denmark said it will allow the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline to pass through its territory.The decision removes the last important hurdle for the $11 billion project, which is slated for commissioning by the end of this year and bolster gas flows from Siberia into Germany. The link has drawn the threat of sanctions from the U.S., which wants Europe to buy its liquefied natural gas. It risks reigniting a feud between Donald Trump and Danish lawmakers that erupted in the summer after the U.S. president’s offer to buy Greenland.Russian President Vladimir Putin welcomed the pipeline decision. “Denmark showed itself to be a responsible participant in international relations, defending its interests and sovereignty and the interests of its main partners in Europe,” he told a briefing in Budapest, where he was on a visit.The green light gives Gazprom PJSC, Russia’s gas export champion and already Europe’s biggest supplier, yet another route to one of the world’s most liquid gas markets. While Trump has accused Russia of using its natural gas as a political weapon, it’s ultimately a commercial deal over which Washington has little influence, according to Raffaello Pantucci, Director of Security Studies at the Royal United Services Institute in London.“It’s frankly too far advanced,” Pantucci said. “Who are they going to sanction?”The approval also gives Russia more clout in ongoing talks with Ukraine on a new gas transit deal, increasing the risk of a disruption from Jan. 1. Uncertainty about whether those two nations can agree on time has been weighing on forward prices in Europe and sending incentives for traders to stockpile gas as a cushion against disruption.“If Gazprom are confident in Nord Stream 2’s imminent completion, it may encourage a tougher negotiating stance on any new Ukrainian transit deal,” said John Twomey, a gas analyst at BloombergNEF in London. “If anything, the risks of a disruption on Jan. 1 have gone up as a result of this.”The pipeline has divided EU governments, with nations led by Poland concerned about the bloc’s increasing dependence on Russian gas.“It is not too late to stop NS2,” an official at the U.S. embassy in Germany said. “There are clear negative energy security and geopolitical implications for Europe from Putin’s pipeline. The U.S. government agrees with the European Parliament, the U.S. House and nearly 20 European countries in our opposition to NS2.”Russia, Ukraine, Europe Pledge New Gas Deal by Year-EndDenmark said on Wednesday it will allow the pipeline to pass southeast of the island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea. The company behind the pipeline submitted the route plan in April. Denmark had been conducting a security and environmental review of the project.Trump had objected to the link, instead urging the European Union to diversify the sources of its energy and dilute Putin’s economic influence over the region. U.S. officials have also warned that project partners are at an elevated risk of U.S. sanctions.The approval is another snub of Trump by the Nordic country after it ruled out his proposal to buy Greenland this summer. The president responded by canceling a state visit to Denmark.The Danish approval covers 147 kilometers (91 miles) of the project. Nord Stream 2 said in its statement that it has already completed 87%, or 2,100 kilometers, of the pipeline in Russian, Finnish and Swedish waters as well as most of the German part. Dan Jorgensen, Denmark’s minister for climate, energy and utilities, declined to comment on Wednesday.Nord Stream 2 said it will continue its “constructive cooperation with the Danish authorities to complete the pipeline.”Six WeeksGazprom CEO Alexey Miller said that the pipeline is expected to be completed on time by the end of the year. “The remaining 147 kilometers -- that’s five weeks of work,” Miller told reporters in Budapest.A statement from the company highlighted some uncertainties in that timetable. Nord Stream 2 said Wednesday the actual start of the construction depends on a number of legal, technical and environmental factors, which will “take a few weeks” and the project aims for completion “in the coming months.”Gazprom can’t use the permit for the next four weeks when all involved parties have leeway to make a complaint under Danish law. Those issues left analysts anticipating some delay beyond Jan. 1 for the completion of the link.“It’s unlikely that Nord Stream 2 is online in time for Jan. 1, so Ukrainian transit disruption risks remains,” said Twomey.While Gazprom owns the pipeline, half the financing of the 8 billion-euro capital cost comes from five European companies: Uniper SE and Wintershall of Germany, OMV AG of Austria, Engie SA of France and Royal Dutch Shell Plc.Dutch gas for the first quarter declined to the lowest since at least 2017 as the region is oversupplied with the fuel, storage sites across Europe are full, and LNG imports surge.(Updates with Putin comment in third paragraph.)\--With assistance from Dina Khrennikova, Vanessa Dezem and Ilya Arkhipov.To contact the reporters on this story: Morten Buttler in Copenhagen at mbuttler@bloomberg.net;William Wilkes in Frankfurt at wwilkes1@bloomberg.net;Anna Shiryaevskaya in London at ashiryaevska@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Christian Wienberg at cwienberg@bloomberg.net, ;Tasneem Hanfi Brögger at tbrogger@bloomberg.net, ;Nick Rigillo at nrigillo@bloomberg.net, Gregory L.

Meghan McCain Spars With Cory Booker Over Civility: Beto Was ‘Very Nasty’ to Me!,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:39:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/meghan-mccain-spars-cory-booker-163901660.html,"During a Wednesday interview with Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, The View’s Meghan McCain did what she apparently does best: Make the conversation about herself and, in this case, her personal beef with a presidential hopeful.After applauding Booker for saying Medicare for All is unrealistic, the conservative View co-host took issue with the New Jersey senator’s support for mandatory gun buybacks. This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he’s going to take her brother’s guns.After a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they’d continue the conversation in the next segment.“No we’re not,” McCain grumbled. “It’s fine.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 10:05:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-warren-untenable-plans-140521979.html,"If you’ve been having trouble finding someone to walk your dog, don’t worry. Any day now, Elizabeth Warren will announce “a plan for that.” It will undoubtedly be comprehensive, detailed, and replete with subsidies for lower- and middle-class dog walkers and underserved breeds. It will cost tens of billions of dollars and will receive widespread positive notice from the media. However, to judge by her other recent plans, the one thing it won’t include is any discussion of how she plans to pay for it.The Massachusetts senator has challenged and possibly overtaken former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, largely based on having a plan for the government to tackle every problem facing this country, no matter how big or how small, from issues with military housing to Puerto Rican debt to climate change.The price tag for this massive expansion of government is enormous. Much of the attention in recent weeks has been focused on Warren’s embrace of Medicare for All, which she refuses to admit would require an increase in middle-class taxes. Even Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has conceded that such proposals, which would cost $30–40 trillion over 10 years, cannot be financed without tax hikes. Warren’s refusal to address this obvious fact makes her look less like a would-be policy wonk and more like a typical politician.But even setting aside Medicare for All, Warren’s plans are likely to dump oceans of red ink onto our growing national debt. Her non-health-care spending proposals already total some $7.5 trillion per year over the next 10 years. Although these are not quite Bernie levels of government largesse, her proposals would still require nearly double our current levels of spending.To pay for all this, Warren proposes a variety of tax hikes, mostly designed to hit corporations or high-earners: higher payroll taxes for those earning more than $250,000 per year; a 7 percent profits tax on companies earning more than $100 million; a 60 percent lobbying tax on firms that spend a million or more on lobbying, and so forth. But the biggest chunk of money would come from Warren’s proposed “wealth tax,” a 2 to 3 percent levy on net worth above $50 million. Warren estimates that this wealth tax will pull in more than $2.75 trillion over ten years. It won’t.First, there is the slight problem that a wealth tax is probably unconstitutional. Of course, constitutional constraints are quaint notions in the Age of Trump. Regardless, it is worth noting that the Constitution permits the federal government to impose only “direct taxes,” such as a property tax. That’s why it required a constitutional amendment to enact the federal income tax. Many constitutional scholars warn that a wealth tax is neither a direct tax nor income tax.Even if Warren can find a way around the constitutional guardrails -- perhaps by something such as a retrospective wealth tax in which you wait until a taxpayer sells assets or passes away -- a wealth tax is unlikely to raise anywhere near the amount of money she predicts.Simply look at Europe’s experiments with wealth taxes. At one time, a dozen European countries imposed wealth taxes. Today, all but three have abandoned those levies. Among those repealing their wealth tax are the Scandinavian social democracies that Warren admires, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Norway retains a wealth tax but has significantly reduced it in recent years. Additional countries abandoning the tax include Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Other countries, such as Great Britain, have considered wealth taxes and rejected them.They did so because wealth taxes are administratively complex and difficult to enforce. Also, they significantly reduce investment, entrepreneurship, and, ultimately, economic growth. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, European wealth taxes raised, on average, only about 0.2 percent of GDP in revenues. By comparison, the U.S. federal income tax raises 8 percent of GDP.Two groups, however, would benefit substantially from a wealth tax. The tax would be a full-employment opportunity for the tax-preparation industry and for lawyers. After all, we would now have to determine fair market value for everything from homes and vehicles to artwork and jewelry to family pension rights and intellectual property. The other big winner would be lobbyists, who could be expected to descend on Washington en masse seeking exemptions and exceptions for their clients. If you think the tax code is a mess today, just wait until D.C. is done with Warren’s plan.There is an old Yiddish proverb that goes “Mann tracht, un Gott Lacht,” or “Man plans, and God laughs.” It is all well and good that Senator Warren has a plan for everything. But until she actually figures out how to pay for everything without crippling our economy, such plans really don’t add up.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/t_XOfhQ2Q8pn0Eihbaza4g--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/710b4188b8e44ebd02c332c03dfb8d66,Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans

Tucker Carlson and Guest Blame Diversity and ‘Woke’ Culture for California Fires,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 07:17:19 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/tucker-carlson-guest-blame-diversity-032855316.html,"Fox NewsFox News host Tucker Carlson and his guest, conservative YouTube personality Dave Rubin, both insisted Tuesday night that the wildfires burning across California are due largely to progressive ideology, “woke” culture, and diversity in hiring.During Tuesday’s broadcast of Tucker Carlson Tonight, Carlson welcomed on Rubin, a political commentator and podcaster, to discuss the issues surrounding the large fires engulfing the state, including those related to the electrical grid and firefighting methods.“PG&E; strikes me as almost a metaphor for the destruction of the state,” Carlson said about the state’s power company. “Here’s the utility which doesn’t really know anything about its own infrastructure but knows everything about the race of its employees. How did we get there?”After noting that he lives near one of the fires in the Los Angeles area, Rubin immediately took aim at liberal politics as the main reason the wildfires have grown so large and dangerous.“The problem right now is that everything, EVERYTHING, from academia to public utilities to politics, everything that goes woke, that buys into this ridiculous progressive ideology that cares about what contractors are LGBT or how many black firemen we have or white this or Asian that, everything that goes that road eventually breaks down,” he declared.As Carlson nodded and said “that’s true,” Rubin continued, complaining that this isn’t how “freedom is supposed to operate.”“What is supposed to happen—imagine if your house was on fire,” he added. “Would you care what the public utility or what the fire company, what contractor they brought in, what gender or sexuality or any of those things he or she was? It’s just absolutely ridiculous.”The Fox News host continued to agree with Rubin, who went on to tie PG&E;’s preemptive blackouts to a lack of “libertarian or conservative-minded people in California to fight what the progressives are doing to the state.”“If you can’t keep the lights on and you can’t keep the place from burning down, you’ve reached the point where there is no kind of lying about it anymore,” Carlson concluded. “It’s falling apart.

"Former &lt;/&gt;Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:11:25 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/former-time-editor-wants-hate-211125098.html,"A former Time editor claimed that the United States needs a law banning hate speech, and that President Donald Trump “might be in violation of it” if there were one -- because, apparently, he doesn’t notice the irony of holding both of these views at once.In a Tuesday tweet promoting his Washington Post piece, titled “Why America needs a hate speech law,” Richard Stengel stated:> My @WashingtonPost piece on why the very broadness of the First Amendment suggests we should have a hate speech law. And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f> > -- Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019In the piece, Stengel writes that “many nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred” in the wake of World War II:> These laws started out as protections against the kinds of anti-Semitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws, but there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general, hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.“I’m all for protecting ‘thought that we hate,’ but not speech that incites hate,” he continues. “It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.”It’s interesting how Stengel actually does acknowledge the fact that “there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is,” and yet he still wants laws banning it. This makes absolutely no sense. After all, when he calls for laws to ban “hate speech,” he is, inherently, giving the government the power to decide what would and would not qualify -- the exact same government that is led by Donald Trump, and that is full of people who support him.In other words: Stengel somehow trusts that the government will have the same view of “hate speech” as he does, and then, in the same thought, seems to acknowledge that there’s actually no way that many of them would. Unless he thinks that the president and his congressional supporters would actually pass a law that they’d be in violation of, his argument for “hate speech” laws winds up being a pretty great argument against them.It’s ironic, but it’s not new: More often than not, it’s the uber-progressives arguing for laws against “hate speech” -- despite the fact that they’re often the same people who are also arguing that Donald Trump and Republicans are constantly spewing it. Maybe it’s just me, but if I thought that the leader of my government was, you know, literally Hitler or whatever, the last thing that I’d want would be to give that person and their supporters control over my speech.Yes, the First Amendment gives us the right to be “offensive” with our speech. Given the fact that a new thing seems to be declared “racist” or “sexist” every day, I’m certainly glad that we do have this protection. After all, it would only take there being a few too many of the “super woke” in our government for a phrase like “you guys” to become a criminal offense.The truth is, though, the right to be “offensive” (however you define that subjective term, anyway) is not even the most important role that our First Amendment plays. No, what’s most important is that it protects our right to speak out against the government when we see fit -- without having to worry about its retaliation.

NYC Medical Examiner Dismisses Epstein ‘Homicide’ Claim by Dr. Michael Baden,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 15:28:10 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/nyc-medical-examiner-dismisses-epstein-192810863.html,"Robyn Beck/ReutersNew York City’s chief medical examiner pushed back hard Wednesday against a celebrity pathologist-for-hire’s conspiracy-stirring claim that Jeffrey Epstein’s autopsy was more consistent with homicide than suicide.“The original medical investigation was thorough and complete. There is no reason for a second medical investigation by our office,” said Dr. Barbara Sampson.Sampson determined Epstein died by suicide from hanging in his jail cell in August, while he was awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.Epstein’s lawyers and family have refused to accept her finding, and the disgraced financier’s brother hired Dr. Michael Baden—erstwhile host of HBO’s Autopsy—to do his own investigation.Jeffrey Epstein’s Death Ruled Suicide by Hanging: New York City Medical ExaminerDuring an appearance Wednesday morning on Fox News, where he is a contributor, Baden said his own review isn’t complete but nonetheless suggested that suicide isn’t the cause of death.He claimed a collection of neck fractures in Epstein’s hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage “are extremely unusual in suicidal hangings and could occur much more commonly in homicidal strangulation.”“I’ve not seen in 50 years where that occurred in a suicidal hanging case,” Baden said.Although more common in homicidal strangulation cases, some studies have found that hyoid and thyroid fractures are not rare in suicidal hangings.A 2000 study in Australia found fractures in nearly half the 40 suicide cases it examined and said they were even more common in older victims and men; in fact, 15 percent had fractures of both the hyoid and the thyroid. And a 2010 study out of Thailand found such fractures in 25 percent of the confirmed suicides it reviewed.After His Suicide Watch Ended, Jeffrey Epstein Was Left to Look After HimselfBaden, who observed the autopsy performed by Sampson, served briefly as the city’s chief medical examiner before being fired in 1979 by then-Mayor Ed Koch in response to a complaint that he told doctors during a guest-speaking event that Gov. Nelson Rockefeller had died during sexual intercourse.Three years later, he was dismissed as chief deputy medical examiner by Suffolk County, New York, over a magazine article about ways to kill that wouldn’t show up in an autopsy; he protested that he was misquoted.In the '70s, Baden helped Congress investigate the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.—he concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald and James Earl Ray, respectively, were the killers—but became famous for serving as a private pathologist in high-profile cases like the Aaron Hernandez suicide, the O.J. Simpson murder trial, and the Jayson Williams shooting. He also served as a defense witness in the Phil Spector murder trial, where he reportedly testified that he had no conflict of interest in the case even though his wife was heading Spector’s legal team.Baden isn’t the only one skeptical about the official account of Epstein’s death at the high-security federal lockup in Manhattan, which is currently the subject of a Justice Department probe.Spencer Kuvin, a lawyer representing victims of Epstein, said serious questions remain, including the whereabouts of the guards assigned to monitor him, why the cameras outside his cell apparently didn’t work, and why he was taken off suicide watch.“It all makes no sense. Until they come out with the evidence, I don’t believe anything they’re telling us,” Kuvin said. “Exactly what happened I can’t tell you, but I certainly don’t believe the story they’re trying to feed everyone.”Sigrid McCawley, an attorney at Boies Schiller Flexner, the law firm representing some of Epstein’s victims, said the ongoing Justice Department probe “limits what can and should be said at this time.”“But as the public has come to to understand the horrifying scope and scale of the international sex trafficking system he operated for decades with impunity, what really matters for the brave survivors who are seeking justice is how he lived, not how he died,” she said. “That is how the man should be judged.”Kuvin said his clients are “more interested in seeing co-conspirators prosecuted” than in delving into Epstein autopsy theories.“The justice system failed. They either allowed him to take his own life or someone got in there and killed him,” Kuvin told The Daily Beast. “Either way, it’s a failure of the Justice Department… [which] has failed them repeatedly over the last 13 years. This was just one more time.”If you or a loved one are struggling with suicidal thoughts, please reach out to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), or contact the Crisis Text Line by texting TALK to 741741Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:17:36 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/record-wave-lone-child-migrants-122133758.html,"TENOSIQUE, Mexico -- The United States has detained more children trying to cross the nation's southwest border on their own over the last year than during any other period on record, surpassing the surge of unaccompanied minors that set off a crisis during the Obama administration, according to new figures released Tuesday.U.S. immigration authorities apprehended 76,020 minors, most of them from Central America, traveling without their parents in the fiscal year that ended in September -- 52% more than during the last fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Mexico is experiencing the same surge. Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period -- pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.In interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous -- and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.""These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,"" Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters. ""And each month during the fiscal year, the numbers increased. You saw them. We all saw them.""The young migrants came alongside a historic wave of families traveling together, also largely from Central America. They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.Marvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced -- and he pressed on.""Quitting was not an option,"" Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. ""You wipe your tears and carry on.""For the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they'd kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.His parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said. ""We can't bear losing another son,"" they told him. ""You have to go.""He left home in the spring, with $40 in his pocket and no plan except to find work in a safer place.As for most underage migrants traveling without their parents, his trip north has been a feat of improvisation and courage. He walked and hitchhiked through Honduras and Guatemala. He slept in churches, under trees or wherever he found himself when night fell.Along the way, he gathered crucial bits of information from fellow migrants: the best route to take, locations of shelters up ahead, places to avoid, where to forage for food.As huge numbers of young migrants from Central America began arriving at the United States' southern border in 2014, the Obama administration scrambled to house them until they could be released to sponsors -- adults who applied to care for them. The shelter system grew dramatically as a result.The Trump administration experienced similar backups at the border just a few years later -- this time because of new, more stringent policies that made the sponsors themselves, who are often undocumented, vulnerable to immigration authorities. This discouraged people from coming forward, leaving thousands of children to languish in the system.The Trump administration has also sought to deter migration by separating thousands of children from their relatives, again driving up the number of children in federally contracted shelters.On the road, while trying to avoid detention, fear and hunger are constant companions for many young migrants.With little or no money in their pockets, they relied on strangers for snacks or meals. They pawed through garbage and scanned drifts of debris on the roadside, hoping to spot an edible morsel.Wilson, a 17-year-old Honduran, said he had feasted on rotten mangos discarded by street vendors.""I used to drink water from potholes when I was too thirsty,"" interjected Mario Leonel, 16, who left home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, several weeks ago without notifying his parents. ""That is the hardest part of it all: the hunger.""When he arrived at the shelter in Tenosique, a small Mexican town near the Guatemala border, he called his parents in Honduras, who burst into tears and pleaded for him to return. He said no. He was tired of all the violence in his country, and wanted to get asylum in the United States.After Marvel slipped across the Guatemala-Mexico border in May, he found room at a shelter in Tenosique, which serves as a transit point for many migrants. He quickly made new friends among other teenage migrants who had made it this far, mainly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador.On a recent afternoon, several of them gathered in a two-story building that had been reserved for minors, its walls painted with colorful animal murals. The boys cracked jokes, roughhoused and argued about who was the cutest girl in the shelter.Outside, Dulce, a 16-year-old transgender migrant from Guatemala, sat alone on train tracks pining for a boy she had met at the shelter. He had left without explanation and she was lovesick.""I just can't get him out of my mind,"" she said.She left her hometown four months earlier to escape abuse from her family and strangers, including a sexual assault by gang members when she was 12. She made it as far as central Mexico before being detained and deported. Five days after returning home, she set off again.""I left because I had nothing there and no one to protect me,"" she said. ""At least here I am safe.""Though the United States remains the destination of choice for most unaccompanied minors, an increasing number are setting their sights no farther than Mexico, advocates and migrants say.Sometimes they have no choice: Mexico's increased enforcement measures have made it more difficult for migrants to make it to the border with the United States. And even if they reach the United States, recent policies have drastically lowered the possibilities of getting asylum.In Mexico, when unaccompanied minors are detained, the law mandates that they be released right away into the custody of the national child protection agency, which finds them accommodation in shelters designed for children.But migrants' advocates say the government has been holding children in the nation's overcrowded detention centers for far too long, and that some children are quickly funneled into the deportation process rather than being given a fair chance to seek asylum or some other form of relief.""No child should ever be held at a detention center,"" said Elba Coria, a migration expert from the Clinic for Refugees at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City. ""But while international standards consider children's detention as an exceptional measure, amid Mexico's migration chaos, it is the rule.""Neither Marvel nor any of his new friends in the Tenosique shelter had been detained by the authorities. All had managed to cross into Mexico from Guatemala and had applied for asylum in Mexico after talking through their options with the shelter staff.They now plan to remain in Mexico and look for work and study opportunities -- even if they haven't abandoned hope of making it to the United States.""It is every Honduran's boy dream to get to the United States, where there is more money and kids are able to go to school,"" said Jose Angel, 17. He was born with a disability that left him unable to use his arms and left his hometown because his grandmother could no longer take care of him.He was hopeful he could apply for asylum in the United States despite Trump's many efforts to severely lower the number of people granted asylum. ""It is scary, but you have to take a chance,"" he said.On a recent morning, Alan, a 17-year-old Guatemalan migrant, sat on the sidewalk outside a migrant shelter in the city of Palenque, in southern Mexico. He had just crossed the border and was exhausted. Mexican immigration officials had stopped a bus he was on, but he managed to escape into the countryside and hide.Alan planned to take a nap, shower and have a meal before trying illegally to board a freight train known as The Beast. It runs from Mexico's border with Guatemala to its border with the United States and, for decades, migrants have clung to it to speed through much of Mexico.His hope was to make it to the U.S. border and petition for asylum. He was undeterred by Trump's recent efforts to restrict asylum claims or curb immigration.""One way or another, I have to make it to the other side where there are skyscrapers and life is better,"" he said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5ol82jExNHqBHa7IGzz2mw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/03f35d3f9d537a8dc9fe503d06c098de,"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation"
Denmark Snubs Trump With Approval of Russian Gas Pipe to Europe,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 14:14:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/denmark-snubs-trump-approval-russian-141104626.html,"(Bloomberg) -- In a major boost for Russia’s effort to tighten its grip over natural gas supplies to western Europe, Denmark said it will allow the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline to pass through its territory.The decision removes the last important hurdle for the $11 billion project, which is slated for commissioning by the end of this year and bolster gas flows from Siberia into Germany. The link has drawn the threat of sanctions from the U.S., which wants Europe to buy its liquefied natural gas. It risks reigniting a feud between Donald Trump and Danish lawmakers that erupted in the summer after the U.S. president’s offer to buy Greenland.Russian President Vladimir Putin welcomed the pipeline decision. “Denmark showed itself to be a responsible participant in international relations, defending its interests and sovereignty and the interests of its main partners in Europe,” he told a briefing in Budapest, where he was on a visit.The green light gives Gazprom PJSC, Russia’s gas export champion and already Europe’s biggest supplier, yet another route to one of the world’s most liquid gas markets. While Trump has accused Russia of using its natural gas as a political weapon, it’s ultimately a commercial deal over which Washington has little influence, according to Raffaello Pantucci, Director of Security Studies at the Royal United Services Institute in London.“It’s frankly too far advanced,” Pantucci said. “Who are they going to sanction?”The approval also gives Russia more clout in ongoing talks with Ukraine on a new gas transit deal, increasing the risk of a disruption from Jan. 1. Uncertainty about whether those two nations can agree on time has been weighing on forward prices in Europe and sending incentives for traders to stockpile gas as a cushion against disruption.“If Gazprom are confident in Nord Stream 2’s imminent completion, it may encourage a tougher negotiating stance on any new Ukrainian transit deal,” said John Twomey, a gas analyst at BloombergNEF in London. “If anything, the risks of a disruption on Jan. 1 have gone up as a result of this.”The pipeline has divided EU governments, with nations led by Poland concerned about the bloc’s increasing dependence on Russian gas.“It is not too late to stop NS2,” an official at the U.S. embassy in Germany said. “There are clear negative energy security and geopolitical implications for Europe from Putin’s pipeline. The U.S. government agrees with the European Parliament, the U.S. House and nearly 20 European countries in our opposition to NS2.”Russia, Ukraine, Europe Pledge New Gas Deal by Year-EndDenmark said on Wednesday it will allow the pipeline to pass southeast of the island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea. The company behind the pipeline submitted the route plan in April. Denmark had been conducting a security and environmental review of the project.Trump had objected to the link, instead urging the European Union to diversify the sources of its energy and dilute Putin’s economic influence over the region. U.S. officials have also warned that project partners are at an elevated risk of U.S. sanctions.The approval is another snub of Trump by the Nordic country after it ruled out his proposal to buy Greenland this summer. The president responded by canceling a state visit to Denmark.The Danish approval covers 147 kilometers (91 miles) of the project. Nord Stream 2 said in its statement that it has already completed 87%, or 2,100 kilometers, of the pipeline in Russian, Finnish and Swedish waters as well as most of the German part. Dan Jorgensen, Denmark’s minister for climate, energy and utilities, declined to comment on Wednesday.Nord Stream 2 said it will continue its “constructive cooperation with the Danish authorities to complete the pipeline.”Six WeeksGazprom CEO Alexey Miller said that the pipeline is expected to be completed on time by the end of the year. “The remaining 147 kilometers -- that’s five weeks of work,” Miller told reporters in Budapest.A statement from the company highlighted some uncertainties in that timetable. Nord Stream 2 said Wednesday the actual start of the construction depends on a number of legal, technical and environmental factors, which will “take a few weeks” and the project aims for completion “in the coming months.”Gazprom can’t use the permit for the next four weeks when all involved parties have leeway to make a complaint under Danish law. Those issues left analysts anticipating some delay beyond Jan. 1 for the completion of the link.“It’s unlikely that Nord Stream 2 is online in time for Jan. 1, so Ukrainian transit disruption risks remains,” said Twomey.While Gazprom owns the pipeline, half the financing of the 8 billion-euro capital cost comes from five European companies: Uniper SE and Wintershall of Germany, OMV AG of Austria, Engie SA of France and Royal Dutch Shell Plc.Dutch gas for the first quarter declined to the lowest since at least 2017 as the region is oversupplied with the fuel, storage sites across Europe are full, and LNG imports surge.(Updates with Putin comment in third paragraph.)\--With assistance from Dina Khrennikova, Vanessa Dezem and Ilya Arkhipov.To contact the reporters on this story: Morten Buttler in Copenhagen at mbuttler@bloomberg.net;William Wilkes in Frankfurt at wwilkes1@bloomberg.net;Anna Shiryaevskaya in London at ashiryaevska@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Christian Wienberg at cwienberg@bloomberg.net, ;Tasneem Hanfi Brögger at tbrogger@bloomberg.net, ;Nick Rigillo at nrigillo@bloomberg.net, Gregory L.

Meghan McCain Spars With Cory Booker Over Civility: Beto Was ‘Very Nasty’ to Me!,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:39:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/meghan-mccain-spars-cory-booker-163901660.html,"During a Wednesday interview with Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, The View’s Meghan McCain did what she apparently does best: Make the conversation about herself and, in this case, her personal beef with a presidential hopeful.After applauding Booker for saying Medicare for All is unrealistic, the conservative View co-host took issue with the New Jersey senator’s support for mandatory gun buybacks. This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he’s going to take her brother’s guns.After a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they’d continue the conversation in the next segment.“No we’re not,” McCain grumbled. “It’s fine.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 10:05:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-warren-untenable-plans-140521979.html,"If you’ve been having trouble finding someone to walk your dog, don’t worry. Any day now, Elizabeth Warren will announce “a plan for that.” It will undoubtedly be comprehensive, detailed, and replete with subsidies for lower- and middle-class dog walkers and underserved breeds. It will cost tens of billions of dollars and will receive widespread positive notice from the media. However, to judge by her other recent plans, the one thing it won’t include is any discussion of how she plans to pay for it.The Massachusetts senator has challenged and possibly overtaken former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, largely based on having a plan for the government to tackle every problem facing this country, no matter how big or how small, from issues with military housing to Puerto Rican debt to climate change.The price tag for this massive expansion of government is enormous. Much of the attention in recent weeks has been focused on Warren’s embrace of Medicare for All, which she refuses to admit would require an increase in middle-class taxes. Even Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has conceded that such proposals, which would cost $30–40 trillion over 10 years, cannot be financed without tax hikes. Warren’s refusal to address this obvious fact makes her look less like a would-be policy wonk and more like a typical politician.But even setting aside Medicare for All, Warren’s plans are likely to dump oceans of red ink onto our growing national debt. Her non-health-care spending proposals already total some $7.5 trillion per year over the next 10 years. Although these are not quite Bernie levels of government largesse, her proposals would still require nearly double our current levels of spending.To pay for all this, Warren proposes a variety of tax hikes, mostly designed to hit corporations or high-earners: higher payroll taxes for those earning more than $250,000 per year; a 7 percent profits tax on companies earning more than $100 million; a 60 percent lobbying tax on firms that spend a million or more on lobbying, and so forth. But the biggest chunk of money would come from Warren’s proposed “wealth tax,” a 2 to 3 percent levy on net worth above $50 million. Warren estimates that this wealth tax will pull in more than $2.75 trillion over ten years. It won’t.First, there is the slight problem that a wealth tax is probably unconstitutional. Of course, constitutional constraints are quaint notions in the Age of Trump. Regardless, it is worth noting that the Constitution permits the federal government to impose only “direct taxes,” such as a property tax. That’s why it required a constitutional amendment to enact the federal income tax. Many constitutional scholars warn that a wealth tax is neither a direct tax nor income tax.Even if Warren can find a way around the constitutional guardrails -- perhaps by something such as a retrospective wealth tax in which you wait until a taxpayer sells assets or passes away -- a wealth tax is unlikely to raise anywhere near the amount of money she predicts.Simply look at Europe’s experiments with wealth taxes. At one time, a dozen European countries imposed wealth taxes. Today, all but three have abandoned those levies. Among those repealing their wealth tax are the Scandinavian social democracies that Warren admires, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Norway retains a wealth tax but has significantly reduced it in recent years. Additional countries abandoning the tax include Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Other countries, such as Great Britain, have considered wealth taxes and rejected them.They did so because wealth taxes are administratively complex and difficult to enforce. Also, they significantly reduce investment, entrepreneurship, and, ultimately, economic growth. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, European wealth taxes raised, on average, only about 0.2 percent of GDP in revenues. By comparison, the U.S. federal income tax raises 8 percent of GDP.Two groups, however, would benefit substantially from a wealth tax. The tax would be a full-employment opportunity for the tax-preparation industry and for lawyers. After all, we would now have to determine fair market value for everything from homes and vehicles to artwork and jewelry to family pension rights and intellectual property. The other big winner would be lobbyists, who could be expected to descend on Washington en masse seeking exemptions and exceptions for their clients. If you think the tax code is a mess today, just wait until D.C. is done with Warren’s plan.There is an old Yiddish proverb that goes “Mann tracht, un Gott Lacht,” or “Man plans, and God laughs.” It is all well and good that Senator Warren has a plan for everything. But until she actually figures out how to pay for everything without crippling our economy, such plans really don’t add up.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/t_XOfhQ2Q8pn0Eihbaza4g--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/710b4188b8e44ebd02c332c03dfb8d66,Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans

Tucker Carlson and Guest Blame Diversity and ‘Woke’ Culture for California Fires,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 07:17:19 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/tucker-carlson-guest-blame-diversity-032855316.html,"Fox NewsFox News host Tucker Carlson and his guest, conservative YouTube personality Dave Rubin, both insisted Tuesday night that the wildfires burning across California are due largely to progressive ideology, “woke” culture, and diversity in hiring.During Tuesday’s broadcast of Tucker Carlson Tonight, Carlson welcomed on Rubin, a political commentator and podcaster, to discuss the issues surrounding the large fires engulfing the state, including those related to the electrical grid and firefighting methods.“PG&E; strikes me as almost a metaphor for the destruction of the state,” Carlson said about the state’s power company. “Here’s the utility which doesn’t really know anything about its own infrastructure but knows everything about the race of its employees. How did we get there?”After noting that he lives near one of the fires in the Los Angeles area, Rubin immediately took aim at liberal politics as the main reason the wildfires have grown so large and dangerous.“The problem right now is that everything, EVERYTHING, from academia to public utilities to politics, everything that goes woke, that buys into this ridiculous progressive ideology that cares about what contractors are LGBT or how many black firemen we have or white this or Asian that, everything that goes that road eventually breaks down,” he declared.As Carlson nodded and said “that’s true,” Rubin continued, complaining that this isn’t how “freedom is supposed to operate.”“What is supposed to happen—imagine if your house was on fire,” he added. “Would you care what the public utility or what the fire company, what contractor they brought in, what gender or sexuality or any of those things he or she was? It’s just absolutely ridiculous.”The Fox News host continued to agree with Rubin, who went on to tie PG&E;’s preemptive blackouts to a lack of “libertarian or conservative-minded people in California to fight what the progressives are doing to the state.”“If you can’t keep the lights on and you can’t keep the place from burning down, you’ve reached the point where there is no kind of lying about it anymore,” Carlson concluded. “It’s falling apart. It’s a disaster. It’s not civilized anymore.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

"Former &lt;/&gt;Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:11:25 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/former-time-editor-wants-hate-211125098.html,"A former Time editor claimed that the United States needs a law banning hate speech, and that President Donald Trump “might be in violation of it” if there were one -- because, apparently, he doesn’t notice the irony of holding both of these views at once.In a Tuesday tweet promoting his Washington Post piece, titled “Why America needs a hate speech law,” Richard Stengel stated:> My @WashingtonPost piece on why the very broadness of the First Amendment suggests we should have a hate speech law. And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f> > -- Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019In the piece, Stengel writes that “many nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred” in the wake of World War II:> These laws started out as protections against the kinds of anti-Semitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws, but there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general, hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.“I’m all for protecting ‘thought that we hate,’ but not speech that incites hate,” he continues. “It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.”It’s interesting how Stengel actually does acknowledge the fact that “there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is,” and yet he still wants laws banning it. This makes absolutely no sense. After all, when he calls for laws to ban “hate speech,” he is, inherently, giving the government the power to decide what would and would not qualify -- the exact same government that is led by Donald Trump, and that is full of people who support him.In other words: Stengel somehow trusts that the government will have the same view of “hate speech” as he does, and then, in the same thought, seems to acknowledge that there’s actually no way that many of them would. Unless he thinks that the president and his congressional supporters would actually pass a law that they’d be in violation of, his argument for “hate speech” laws winds up being a pretty great argument against them.It’s ironic, but it’s not new: More often than not, it’s the uber-progressives arguing for laws against “hate speech” -- despite the fact that they’re often the same people who are also arguing that Donald Trump and Republicans are constantly spewing it. Maybe it’s just me, but if I thought that the leader of my government was, you know, literally Hitler or whatever, the last thing that I’d want would be to give that person and their supporters control over my speech.Yes, the First Amendment gives us the right to be “offensive” with our speech. Given the fact that a new thing seems to be declared “racist” or “sexist” every day, I’m certainly glad that we do have this protection. After all, it would only take there being a few too many of the “super woke” in our government for a phrase like “you guys” to become a criminal offense.The truth is, though, the right to be “offensive” (however you define that subjective term, anyway) is not even the most important role that our First Amendment plays. No, what’s most important is that it protects our right to speak out against the government when we see fit -- without having to worry about its retaliation. Like it or not, the only way to ensure that we retain this important check on government power is to never (ever) give its leaders a vehicle take it away.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eTNessteMBpuBTcqmJGuYw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/bae9af12e23cce197b317b5c1be56053,"Former </>Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony"

NYC Medical Examiner Dismisses Epstein ‘Homicide’ Claim by Dr. Michael Baden,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 15:28:10 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/nyc-medical-examiner-dismisses-epstein-192810863.html,"Robyn Beck/ReutersNew York City’s chief medical examiner pushed back hard Wednesday against a celebrity pathologist-for-hire’s conspiracy-stirring claim that Jeffrey Epstein’s autopsy was more consistent with homicide than suicide.“The original medical investigation was thorough and complete. There is no reason for a second medical investigation by our office,” said Dr. Barbara Sampson.Sampson determined Epstein died by suicide from hanging in his jail cell in August, while he was awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.Epstein’s lawyers and family have refused to accept her finding, and the disgraced financier’s brother hired Dr. Michael Baden—erstwhile host of HBO’s Autopsy—to do his own investigation.Jeffrey Epstein’s Death Ruled Suicide by Hanging: New York City Medical ExaminerDuring an appearance Wednesday morning on Fox News, where he is a contributor, Baden said his own review isn’t complete but nonetheless suggested that suicide isn’t the cause of death.He claimed a collection of neck fractures in Epstein’s hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage “are extremely unusual in suicidal hangings and could occur much more commonly in homicidal strangulation.”“I’ve not seen in 50 years where that occurred in a suicidal hanging case,” Baden said.Although more common in homicidal strangulation cases, some studies have found that hyoid and thyroid fractures are not rare in suicidal hangings.A 2000 study in Australia found fractures in nearly half the 40 suicide cases it examined and said they were even more common in older victims and men; in fact, 15 percent had fractures of both the hyoid and the thyroid. And a 2010 study out of Thailand found such fractures in 25 percent of the confirmed suicides it reviewed.After His Suicide Watch Ended, Jeffrey Epstein Was Left to Look After HimselfBaden, who observed the autopsy performed by Sampson, served briefly as the city’s chief medical examiner before being fired in 1979 by then-Mayor Ed Koch in response to a complaint that he told doctors during a guest-speaking event that Gov. Nelson Rockefeller had died during sexual intercourse.Three years later, he was dismissed as chief deputy medical examiner by Suffolk County, New York, over a magazine article about ways to kill that wouldn’t show up in an autopsy; he protested that he was misquoted.In the '70s, Baden helped Congress investigate the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.—he concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald and James Earl Ray, respectively, were the killers—but became famous for serving as a private pathologist in high-profile cases like the Aaron Hernandez suicide, the O.J. Simpson murder trial, and the Jayson Williams shooting. He also served as a defense witness in the Phil Spector murder trial, where he reportedly testified that he had no conflict of interest in the case even though his wife was heading Spector’s legal team.Baden isn’t the only one skeptical about the official account of Epstein’s death at the high-security federal lockup in Manhattan, which is currently the subject of a Justice Department probe.Spencer Kuvin, a lawyer representing victims of Epstein, said serious questions remain, including the whereabouts of the guards assigned to monitor him, why the cameras outside his cell apparently didn’t work, and why he was taken off suicide watch.“It all makes no sense. Until they come out with the evidence, I don’t believe anything they’re telling us,” Kuvin said. “Exactly what happened I can’t tell you, but I certainly don’t believe the story they’re trying to feed everyone.”Sigrid McCawley, an attorney at Boies Schiller Flexner, the law firm representing some of Epstein’s victims, said the ongoing Justice Department probe “limits what can and should be said at this time.”“But as the public has come to to understand the horrifying scope and scale of the international sex trafficking system he operated for decades with impunity, what really matters for the brave survivors who are seeking justice is how he lived, not how he died,” she said. “That is how the man should be judged.”Kuvin said his clients are “more interested in seeing co-conspirators prosecuted” than in delving into Epstein autopsy theories.“The justice system failed. They either allowed him to take his own life or someone got in there and killed him,” Kuvin told The Daily Beast. “Either way, it’s a failure of the Justice Department… [which] has failed them repeatedly over the last 13 years. This was just one more time.”If you or a loved one are struggling with suicidal thoughts, please reach out to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), or contact the Crisis Text Line by texting TALK to 741741Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:17:36 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/record-wave-lone-child-migrants-122133758.html,"TENOSIQUE, Mexico -- The United States has detained more children trying to cross the nation's southwest border on their own over the last year than during any other period on record, surpassing the surge of unaccompanied minors that set off a crisis during the Obama administration, according to new figures released Tuesday.U.S. immigration authorities apprehended 76,020 minors, most of them from Central America, traveling without their parents in the fiscal year that ended in September -- 52% more than during the last fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Mexico is experiencing the same surge. Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period -- pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.In interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous -- and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.""These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,"" Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters. ""And each month during the fiscal year, the numbers increased. You saw them. We all saw them.""The young migrants came alongside a historic wave of families traveling together, also largely from Central America. They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.Marvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced -- and he pressed on.""Quitting was not an option,"" Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. ""You wipe your tears and carry on.""For the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they'd kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.His parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said. ""We can't bear losing another son,"" they told him. ""You have to go.""He left home in the spring, with $40 in his pocket and no plan except to find work in a safer place.As for most underage migrants traveling without their parents, his trip north has been a feat of improvisation and courage. He walked and hitchhiked through Honduras and Guatemala. He slept in churches, under trees or wherever he found himself when night fell.Along the way, he gathered crucial bits of information from fellow migrants: the best route to take, locations of shelters up ahead, places to avoid, where to forage for food.As huge numbers of young migrants from Central America began arriving at the United States' southern border in 2014, the Obama administration scrambled to house them until they could be released to sponsors -- adults who applied to care for them. The shelter system grew dramatically as a result.The Trump administration experienced similar backups at the border just a few years later -- this time because of new, more stringent policies that made the sponsors themselves, who are often undocumented, vulnerable to immigration authorities. This discouraged people from coming forward, leaving thousands of children to languish in the system.The Trump administration has also sought to deter migration by separating thousands of children from their relatives, again driving up the number of children in federally contracted shelters.On the road, while trying to avoid detention, fear and hunger are constant companions for many young migrants.With little or no money in their pockets, they relied on strangers for snacks or meals. They pawed through garbage and scanned drifts of debris on the roadside, hoping to spot an edible morsel.Wilson, a 17-year-old Honduran, said he had feasted on rotten mangos discarded by street vendors.""I used to drink water from potholes when I was too thirsty,"" interjected Mario Leonel, 16, who left home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, several weeks ago without notifying his parents. ""That is the hardest part of it all: the hunger.""When he arrived at the shelter in Tenosique, a small Mexican town near the Guatemala border, he called his parents in Honduras, who burst into tears and pleaded for him to return. He said no. He was tired of all the violence in his country, and wanted to get asylum in the United States.After Marvel slipped across the Guatemala-Mexico border in May, he found room at a shelter in Tenosique, which serves as a transit point for many migrants. He quickly made new friends among other teenage migrants who had made it this far, mainly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador.On a recent afternoon, several of them gathered in a two-story building that had been reserved for minors, its walls painted with colorful animal murals. The boys cracked jokes, roughhoused and argued about who was the cutest girl in the shelter.Outside, Dulce, a 16-year-old transgender migrant from Guatemala, sat alone on train tracks pining for a boy she had met at the shelter. He had left without explanation and she was lovesick.""I just can't get him out of my mind,"" she said.She left her hometown four months earlier to escape abuse from her family and strangers, including a sexual assault by gang members when she was 12. She made it as far as central Mexico before being detained and deported. Five days after returning home, she set off again.""I left because I had nothing there and no one to protect me,"" she said. ""At least here I am safe.""Though the United States remains the destination of choice for most unaccompanied minors, an increasing number are setting their sights no farther than Mexico, advocates and migrants say.Sometimes they have no choice: Mexico's increased enforcement measures have made it more difficult for migrants to make it to the border with the United States. And even if they reach the United States, recent policies have drastically lowered the possibilities of getting asylum.In Mexico, when unaccompanied minors are detained, the law mandates that they be released right away into the custody of the national child protection agency, which finds them accommodation in shelters designed for children.But migrants' advocates say the government has been holding children in the nation's overcrowded detention centers for far too long, and that some children are quickly funneled into the deportation process rather than being given a fair chance to seek asylum or some other form of relief.""No child should ever be held at a detention center,"" said Elba Coria, a migration expert from the Clinic for Refugees at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City. ""But while international standards consider children's detention as an exceptional measure, amid Mexico's migration chaos, it is the rule.""Neither Marvel nor any of his new friends in the Tenosique shelter had been detained by the authorities. All had managed to cross into Mexico from Guatemala and had applied for asylum in Mexico after talking through their options with the shelter staff.They now plan to remain in Mexico and look for work and study opportunities -- even if they haven't abandoned hope of making it to the United States.""It is every Honduran's boy dream to get to the United States, where there is more money and kids are able to go to school,"" said Jose Angel, 17. He was born with a disability that left him unable to use his arms and left his hometown because his grandmother could no longer take care of him.He was hopeful he could apply for asylum in the United States despite Trump's many efforts to severely lower the number of people granted asylum. ""It is scary, but you have to take a chance,"" he said.On a recent morning, Alan, a 17-year-old Guatemalan migrant, sat on the sidewalk outside a migrant shelter in the city of Palenque, in southern Mexico. He had just crossed the border and was exhausted. Mexican immigration officials had stopped a bus he was on, but he managed to escape into the countryside and hide.Alan planned to take a nap, shower and have a meal before trying illegally to board a freight train known as The Beast. It runs from Mexico's border with Guatemala to its border with the United States and, for decades, migrants have clung to it to speed through much of Mexico.His hope was to make it to the U.S. border and petition for asylum. He was undeterred by Trump's recent efforts to restrict asylum claims or curb immigration.""One way or another, I have to make it to the other side where there are skyscrapers and life is better,"" he said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5ol82jExNHqBHa7IGzz2mw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/03f35d3f9d537a8dc9fe503d06c098de,"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation"
Denmark Snubs Trump With Approval of Russian Gas Pipe to Europe,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 14:14:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/denmark-snubs-trump-approval-russian-141104626.html,"(Bloomberg) -- In a major boost for Russia’s effort to tighten its grip over natural gas supplies to western Europe, Denmark said it will allow the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline to pass through its territory.The decision removes the last important hurdle for the $11 billion project, which is slated for commissioning by the end of this year and bolster gas flows from Siberia into Germany. The link has drawn the threat of sanctions from the U.S., which wants Europe to buy its liquefied natural gas. It risks reigniting a feud between Donald Trump and Danish lawmakers that erupted in the summer after the U.S. president’s offer to buy Greenland.Russian President Vladimir Putin welcomed the pipeline decision. “Denmark showed itself to be a responsible participant in international relations, defending its interests and sovereignty and the interests of its main partners in Europe,” he told a briefing in Budapest, where he was on a visit.The green light gives Gazprom PJSC, Russia’s gas export champion and already Europe’s biggest supplier, yet another route to one of the world’s most liquid gas markets. While Trump has accused Russia of using its natural gas as a political weapon, it’s ultimately a commercial deal over which Washington has little influence, according to Raffaello Pantucci, Director of Security Studies at the Royal United Services Institute in London.“It’s frankly too far advanced,” Pantucci said. “Who are they going to sanction?”The approval also gives Russia more clout in ongoing talks with Ukraine on a new gas transit deal, increasing the risk of a disruption from Jan. 1. Uncertainty about whether those two nations can agree on time has been weighing on forward prices in Europe and sending incentives for traders to stockpile gas as a cushion against disruption.“If Gazprom are confident in Nord Stream 2’s imminent completion, it may encourage a tougher negotiating stance on any new Ukrainian transit deal,” said John Twomey, a gas analyst at BloombergNEF in London. “If anything, the risks of a disruption on Jan. 1 have gone up as a result of this.”The pipeline has divided EU governments, with nations led by Poland concerned about the bloc’s increasing dependence on Russian gas.“It is not too late to stop NS2,” an official at the U.S. embassy in Germany said. “There are clear negative energy security and geopolitical implications for Europe from Putin’s pipeline. The U.S. government agrees with the European Parliament, the U.S. House and nearly 20 European countries in our opposition to NS2.”Russia, Ukraine, Europe Pledge New Gas Deal by Year-EndDenmark said on Wednesday it will allow the pipeline to pass southeast of the island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea. The company behind the pipeline submitted the route plan in April. Denmark had been conducting a security and environmental review of the project.Trump had objected to the link, instead urging the European Union to diversify the sources of its energy and dilute Putin’s economic influence over the region. U.S. officials have also warned that project partners are at an elevated risk of U.S. sanctions.The approval is another snub of Trump by the Nordic country after it ruled out his proposal to buy Greenland this summer. The president responded by canceling a state visit to Denmark.The Danish approval covers 147 kilometers (91 miles) of the project. Nord Stream 2 said in its statement that it has already completed 87%, or 2,100 kilometers, of the pipeline in Russian, Finnish and Swedish waters as well as most of the German part. Dan Jorgensen, Denmark’s minister for climate, energy and utilities, declined to comment on Wednesday.Nord Stream 2 said it will continue its “constructive cooperation with the Danish authorities to complete the pipeline.”Six WeeksGazprom CEO Alexey Miller said that the pipeline is expected to be completed on time by the end of the year. “The remaining 147 kilometers -- that’s five weeks of work,” Miller told reporters in Budapest.A statement from the company highlighted some uncertainties in that timetable. Nord Stream 2 said Wednesday the actual start of the construction depends on a number of legal, technical and environmental factors, which will “take a few weeks” and the project aims for completion “in the coming months.”Gazprom can’t use the permit for the next four weeks when all involved parties have leeway to make a complaint under Danish law. Those issues left analysts anticipating some delay beyond Jan. 1 for the completion of the link.“It’s unlikely that Nord Stream 2 is online in time for Jan. 1, so Ukrainian transit disruption risks remains,” said Twomey.While Gazprom owns the pipeline, half the financing of the 8 billion-euro capital cost comes from five European companies: Uniper SE and Wintershall of Germany, OMV AG of Austria, Engie SA of France and Royal Dutch Shell Plc.Dutch gas for the first quarter declined to the lowest since at least 2017 as the region is oversupplied with the fuel, storage sites across Europe are full, and LNG imports surge.(Updates with Putin comment in third paragraph.)\--With assistance from Dina Khrennikova, Vanessa Dezem and Ilya Arkhipov.To contact the reporters on this story: Morten Buttler in Copenhagen at mbuttler@bloomberg.net;William Wilkes in Frankfurt at wwilkes1@bloomberg.net;Anna Shiryaevskaya in London at ashiryaevska@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Christian Wienberg at cwienberg@bloomberg.net, ;Tasneem Hanfi Brögger at tbrogger@bloomberg.net, ;Nick Rigillo at nrigillo@bloomberg.net, Gregory L.

Meghan McCain Spars With Cory Booker Over Civility: Beto Was ‘Very Nasty’ to Me!,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:39:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/meghan-mccain-spars-cory-booker-163901660.html,"During a Wednesday interview with Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, The View’s Meghan McCain did what she apparently does best: Make the conversation about herself and, in this case, her personal beef with a presidential hopeful.After applauding Booker for saying Medicare for All is unrealistic, the conservative View co-host took issue with the New Jersey senator’s support for mandatory gun buybacks. This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump.

Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 10:05:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-warren-untenable-plans-140521979.html,"If you’ve been having trouble finding someone to walk your dog, don’t worry. Any day now, Elizabeth Warren will announce “a plan for that.” It will undoubtedly be comprehensive, detailed, and replete with subsidies for lower- and middle-class dog walkers and underserved breeds. It will cost tens of billions of dollars and will receive widespread positive notice from the media. However, to judge by her other recent plans, the one thing it won’t include is any discussion of how she plans to pay for it.The Massachusetts senator has challenged and possibly overtaken former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, largely based on having a plan for the government to tackle every problem facing this country, no matter how big or how small, from issues with military housing to Puerto Rican debt to climate change.The price tag for this massive expansion of government is enormous. Much of the attention in recent weeks has been focused on Warren’s embrace of Medicare for All, which she refuses to admit would require an increase in middle-class taxes. Even Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has conceded that such proposals, which would cost $30–40 trillion over 10 years, cannot be financed without tax hikes. Warren’s refusal to address this obvious fact makes her look less like a would-be policy wonk and more like a typical politician.But even setting aside Medicare for All, Warren’s plans are likely to dump oceans of red ink onto our growing national debt. Her non-health-care spending proposals already total some $7.5 trillion per year over the next 10 years. Although these are not quite Bernie levels of government largesse, her proposals would still require nearly double our current levels of spending.To pay for all this, Warren proposes a variety of tax hikes, mostly designed to hit corporations or high-earners: higher payroll taxes for those earning more than $250,000 per year; a 7 percent profits tax on companies earning more than $100 million; a 60 percent lobbying tax on firms that spend a million or more on lobbying, and so forth. But the biggest chunk of money would come from Warren’s proposed “wealth tax,” a 2 to 3 percent levy on net worth above $50 million. Warren estimates that this wealth tax will pull in more than $2.75 trillion over ten years. It won’t.First, there is the slight problem that a wealth tax is probably unconstitutional. Of course, constitutional constraints are quaint notions in the Age of Trump. Regardless, it is worth noting that the Constitution permits the federal government to impose only “direct taxes,” such as a property tax. That’s why it required a constitutional amendment to enact the federal income tax. Many constitutional scholars warn that a wealth tax is neither a direct tax nor income tax.Even if Warren can find a way around the constitutional guardrails -- perhaps by something such as a retrospective wealth tax in which you wait until a taxpayer sells assets or passes away -- a wealth tax is unlikely to raise anywhere near the amount of money she predicts.Simply look at Europe’s experiments with wealth taxes. At one time, a dozen European countries imposed wealth taxes. Today, all but three have abandoned those levies. Among those repealing their wealth tax are the Scandinavian social democracies that Warren admires, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Norway retains a wealth tax but has significantly reduced it in recent years. Additional countries abandoning the tax include Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Other countries, such as Great Britain, have considered wealth taxes and rejected them.They did so because wealth taxes are administratively complex and difficult to enforce. Also, they significantly reduce investment, entrepreneurship, and, ultimately, economic growth. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, European wealth taxes raised, on average, only about 0.2 percent of GDP in revenues. By comparison, the U.S. federal income tax raises 8 percent of GDP.Two groups, however, would benefit substantially from a wealth tax. The tax would be a full-employment opportunity for the tax-preparation industry and for lawyers. After all, we would now have to determine fair market value for everything from homes and vehicles to artwork and jewelry to family pension rights and intellectual property. The other big winner would be lobbyists, who could be expected to descend on Washington en masse seeking exemptions and exceptions for their clients. If you think the tax code is a mess today, just wait until D.C. is done with Warren’s plan.There is an old Yiddish proverb that goes “Mann tracht, un Gott Lacht,” or “Man plans, and God laughs.” It is all well and good that Senator Warren has a plan for everything. But until she actually figures out how to pay for everything without crippling our economy, such plans really don’t add up.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/t_XOfhQ2Q8pn0Eihbaza4g--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/710b4188b8e44ebd02c332c03dfb8d66,Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans

Tucker Carlson and Guest Blame Diversity and ‘Woke’ Culture for California Fires,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 07:17:19 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/tucker-carlson-guest-blame-diversity-032855316.html,"Fox NewsFox News host Tucker Carlson and his guest, conservative YouTube personality Dave Rubin, both insisted Tuesday night that the wildfires burning across California are due largely to progressive ideology, “woke” culture, and diversity in hiring.During Tuesday’s broadcast of Tucker Carlson Tonight, Carlson welcomed on Rubin, a political commentator and podcaster, to discuss the issues surrounding the large fires engulfing the state, including those related to the electrical grid and firefighting methods.“PG&E; strikes me as almost a metaphor for the destruction of the state,” Carlson said about the state’s power company. “Here’s the utility which doesn’t really know anything about its own infrastructure but knows everything about the race of its employees. How did we get there?”After noting that he lives near one of the fires in the Los Angeles area, Rubin immediately took aim at liberal politics as the main reason the wildfires have grown so large and dangerous.“The problem right now is that everything, EVERYTHING, from academia to public utilities to politics, everything that goes woke, that buys into this ridiculous progressive ideology that cares about what contractors are LGBT or how many black firemen we have or white this or Asian that, everything that goes that road eventually breaks down,” he declared.As Carlson nodded and said “that’s true,” Rubin continued, complaining that this isn’t how “freedom is supposed to operate.”“What is supposed to happen—imagine if your house was on fire,” he added. “Would you care what the public utility or what the fire company, what contractor they brought in, what gender or sexuality or any of those things he or she was? It’s just absolutely ridiculous.”The Fox News host continued to agree with Rubin, who went on to tie PG&E;’s preemptive blackouts to a lack of “libertarian or conservative-minded people in California to fight what the progressives are doing to the state.”“If you can’t keep the lights on and you can’t keep the place from burning down, you’ve reached the point where there is no kind of lying about it anymore,” Carlson concluded. “It’s falling apart.

"Former &lt;/&gt;Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:11:25 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/former-time-editor-wants-hate-211125098.html,"A former Time editor claimed that the United States needs a law banning hate speech, and that President Donald Trump “might be in violation of it” if there were one -- because, apparently, he doesn’t notice the irony of holding both of these views at once.In a Tuesday tweet promoting his Washington Post piece, titled “Why America needs a hate speech law,” Richard Stengel stated:> My @WashingtonPost piece on why the very broadness of the First Amendment suggests we should have a hate speech law. And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f> > -- Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019In the piece, Stengel writes that “many nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred” in the wake of World War II:> These laws started out as protections against the kinds of anti-Semitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws, but there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general, hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.“I’m all for protecting ‘thought that we hate,’ but not speech that incites hate,” he continues. “It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.”It’s interesting how Stengel actually does acknowledge the fact that “there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is,” and yet he still wants laws banning it. This makes absolutely no sense. After all, when he calls for laws to ban “hate speech,” he is, inherently, giving the government the power to decide what would and would not qualify -- the exact same government that is led by Donald Trump, and that is full of people who support him.In other words: Stengel somehow trusts that the government will have the same view of “hate speech” as he does, and then, in the same thought, seems to acknowledge that there’s actually no way that many of them would. Unless he thinks that the president and his congressional supporters would actually pass a law that they’d be in violation of, his argument for “hate speech” laws winds up being a pretty great argument against them.It’s ironic, but it’s not new: More often than not, it’s the uber-progressives arguing for laws against “hate speech” -- despite the fact that they’re often the same people who are also arguing that Donald Trump and Republicans are constantly spewing it. Maybe it’s just me, but if I thought that the leader of my government was, you know, literally Hitler or whatever, the last thing that I’d want would be to give that person and their supporters control over my speech.Yes, the First Amendment gives us the right to be “offensive” with our speech. Given the fact that a new thing seems to be declared “racist” or “sexist” every day, I’m certainly glad that we do have this protection. After all, it would only take there being a few too many of the “super woke” in our government for a phrase like “you guys” to become a criminal offense.The truth is, though, the right to be “offensive” (however you define that subjective term, anyway) is not even the most important role that our First Amendment plays. No, what’s most important is that it protects our right to speak out against the government when we see fit -- without having to worry about its retaliation. Like it or not, the only way to ensure that we retain this important check on government power is to never (ever) give its leaders a vehicle take it away.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eTNessteMBpuBTcqmJGuYw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/bae9af12e23cce197b317b5c1be56053,"Former </>Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony"

NYC Medical Examiner Dismisses Epstein ‘Homicide’ Claim by Dr. Michael Baden,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 15:28:10 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/nyc-medical-examiner-dismisses-epstein-192810863.html,"Robyn Beck/ReutersNew York City’s chief medical examiner pushed back hard Wednesday against a celebrity pathologist-for-hire’s conspiracy-stirring claim that Jeffrey Epstein’s autopsy was more consistent with homicide than suicide.“The original medical investigation was thorough and complete. There is no reason for a second medical investigation by our office,” said Dr. Barbara Sampson.Sampson determined Epstein died by suicide from hanging in his jail cell in August, while he was awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.Epstein’s lawyers and family have refused to accept her finding, and the disgraced financier’s brother hired Dr. Michael Baden—erstwhile host of HBO’s Autopsy—to do his own investigation.Jeffrey Epstein’s Death Ruled Suicide by Hanging: New York City Medical ExaminerDuring an appearance Wednesday morning on Fox News, where he is a contributor, Baden said his own review isn’t complete but nonetheless suggested that suicide isn’t the cause of death.He claimed a collection of neck fractures in Epstein’s hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage “are extremely unusual in suicidal hangings and could occur much more commonly in homicidal strangulation.”“I’ve not seen in 50 years where that occurred in a suicidal hanging case,” Baden said.Although more common in homicidal strangulation cases, some studies have found that hyoid and thyroid fractures are not rare in suicidal hangings.A 2000 study in Australia found fractures in nearly half the 40 suicide cases it examined and said they were even more common in older victims and men; in fact, 15 percent had fractures of both the hyoid and the thyroid. And a 2010 study out of Thailand found such fractures in 25 percent of the confirmed suicides it reviewed.After His Suicide Watch Ended, Jeffrey Epstein Was Left to Look After HimselfBaden, who observed the autopsy performed by Sampson, served briefly as the city’s chief medical examiner before being fired in 1979 by then-Mayor Ed Koch in response to a complaint that he told doctors during a guest-speaking event that Gov. Nelson Rockefeller had died during sexual intercourse.Three years later, he was dismissed as chief deputy medical examiner by Suffolk County, New York, over a magazine article about ways to kill that wouldn’t show up in an autopsy; he protested that he was misquoted.In the '70s, Baden helped Congress investigate the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.—he concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald and James Earl Ray, respectively, were the killers—but became famous for serving as a private pathologist in high-profile cases like the Aaron Hernandez suicide, the O.J. Simpson murder trial, and the Jayson Williams shooting. He also served as a defense witness in the Phil Spector murder trial, where he reportedly testified that he had no conflict of interest in the case even though his wife was heading Spector’s legal team.Baden isn’t the only one skeptical about the official account of Epstein’s death at the high-security federal lockup in Manhattan, which is currently the subject of a Justice Department probe.Spencer Kuvin, a lawyer representing victims of Epstein, said serious questions remain, including the whereabouts of the guards assigned to monitor him, why the cameras outside his cell apparently didn’t work, and why he was taken off suicide watch.“It all makes no sense. Until they come out with the evidence, I don’t believe anything they’re telling us,” Kuvin said. “Exactly what happened I can’t tell you, but I certainly don’t believe the story they’re trying to feed everyone.”Sigrid McCawley, an attorney at Boies Schiller Flexner, the law firm representing some of Epstein’s victims, said the ongoing Justice Department probe “limits what can and should be said at this time.”“But as the public has come to to understand the horrifying scope and scale of the international sex trafficking system he operated for decades with impunity, what really matters for the brave survivors who are seeking justice is how he lived, not how he died,” she said. “That is how the man should be judged.”Kuvin said his clients are “more interested in seeing co-conspirators prosecuted” than in delving into Epstein autopsy theories.“The justice system failed. They either allowed him to take his own life or someone got in there and killed him,” Kuvin told The Daily Beast. “Either way, it’s a failure of the Justice Department… [which] has failed them repeatedly over the last 13 years. This was just one more time.”If you or a loved one are struggling with suicidal thoughts, please reach out to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), or contact the Crisis Text Line by texting TALK to 741741Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:17:36 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/record-wave-lone-child-migrants-122133758.html,"TENOSIQUE, Mexico -- The United States has detained more children trying to cross the nation's southwest border on their own over the last year than during any other period on record, surpassing the surge of unaccompanied minors that set off a crisis during the Obama administration, according to new figures released Tuesday.U.S. immigration authorities apprehended 76,020 minors, most of them from Central America, traveling without their parents in the fiscal year that ended in September -- 52% more than during the last fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Mexico is experiencing the same surge. Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period -- pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.In interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous -- and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.""These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,"" Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters. ""And each month during the fiscal year, the numbers increased. You saw them. We all saw them.""The young migrants came alongside a historic wave of families traveling together, also largely from Central America. They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.Marvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced -- and he pressed on.""Quitting was not an option,"" Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. ""You wipe your tears and carry on.""For the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they'd kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.His parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said. ""We can't bear losing another son,"" they told him. ""You have to go.""He left home in the spring, with $40 in his pocket and no plan except to find work in a safer place.As for most underage migrants traveling without their parents, his trip north has been a feat of improvisation and courage. He walked and hitchhiked through Honduras and Guatemala. He slept in churches, under trees or wherever he found himself when night fell.Along the way, he gathered crucial bits of information from fellow migrants: the best route to take, locations of shelters up ahead, places to avoid, where to forage for food.As huge numbers of young migrants from Central America began arriving at the United States' southern border in 2014, the Obama administration scrambled to house them until they could be released to sponsors -- adults who applied to care for them. The shelter system grew dramatically as a result.The Trump administration experienced similar backups at the border just a few years later -- this time because of new, more stringent policies that made the sponsors themselves, who are often undocumented, vulnerable to immigration authorities. This discouraged people from coming forward, leaving thousands of children to languish in the system.The Trump administration has also sought to deter migration by separating thousands of children from their relatives, again driving up the number of children in federally contracted shelters.On the road, while trying to avoid detention, fear and hunger are constant companions for many young migrants.With little or no money in their pockets, they relied on strangers for snacks or meals. They pawed through garbage and scanned drifts of debris on the roadside, hoping to spot an edible morsel.Wilson, a 17-year-old Honduran, said he had feasted on rotten mangos discarded by street vendors.""I used to drink water from potholes when I was too thirsty,"" interjected Mario Leonel, 16, who left home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, several weeks ago without notifying his parents. ""That is the hardest part of it all: the hunger.""When he arrived at the shelter in Tenosique, a small Mexican town near the Guatemala border, he called his parents in Honduras, who burst into tears and pleaded for him to return. He said no. He was tired of all the violence in his country, and wanted to get asylum in the United States.After Marvel slipped across the Guatemala-Mexico border in May, he found room at a shelter in Tenosique, which serves as a transit point for many migrants. He quickly made new friends among other teenage migrants who had made it this far, mainly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador.On a recent afternoon, several of them gathered in a two-story building that had been reserved for minors, its walls painted with colorful animal murals. The boys cracked jokes, roughhoused and argued about who was the cutest girl in the shelter.Outside, Dulce, a 16-year-old transgender migrant from Guatemala, sat alone on train tracks pining for a boy she had met at the shelter. He had left without explanation and she was lovesick.""I just can't get him out of my mind,"" she said.She left her hometown four months earlier to escape abuse from her family and strangers, including a sexual assault by gang members when she was 12. She made it as far as central Mexico before being detained and deported. Five days after returning home, she set off again.""I left because I had nothing there and no one to protect me,"" she said. ""At least here I am safe.""Though the United States remains the destination of choice for most unaccompanied minors, an increasing number are setting their sights no farther than Mexico, advocates and migrants say.Sometimes they have no choice: Mexico's increased enforcement measures have made it more difficult for migrants to make it to the border with the United States. And even if they reach the United States, recent policies have drastically lowered the possibilities of getting asylum.In Mexico, when unaccompanied minors are detained, the law mandates that they be released right away into the custody of the national child protection agency, which finds them accommodation in shelters designed for children.But migrants' advocates say the government has been holding children in the nation's overcrowded detention centers for far too long, and that some children are quickly funneled into the deportation process rather than being given a fair chance to seek asylum or some other form of relief.""No child should ever be held at a detention center,"" said Elba Coria, a migration expert from the Clinic for Refugees at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City. ""But while international standards consider children's detention as an exceptional measure, amid Mexico's migration chaos, it is the rule.""Neither Marvel nor any of his new friends in the Tenosique shelter had been detained by the authorities. All had managed to cross into Mexico from Guatemala and had applied for asylum in Mexico after talking through their options with the shelter staff.They now plan to remain in Mexico and look for work and study opportunities -- even if they haven't abandoned hope of making it to the United States.""It is every Honduran's boy dream to get to the United States, where there is more money and kids are able to go to school,"" said Jose Angel, 17. He was born with a disability that left him unable to use his arms and left his hometown because his grandmother could no longer take care of him.He was hopeful he could apply for asylum in the United States despite Trump's many efforts to severely lower the number of people granted asylum. ""It is scary, but you have to take a chance,"" he said.On a recent morning, Alan, a 17-year-old Guatemalan migrant, sat on the sidewalk outside a migrant shelter in the city of Palenque, in southern Mexico. He had just crossed the border and was exhausted. Mexican immigration officials had stopped a bus he was on, but he managed to escape into the countryside and hide.Alan planned to take a nap, shower and have a meal before trying illegally to board a freight train known as The Beast. It runs from Mexico's border with Guatemala to its border with the United States and, for decades, migrants have clung to it to speed through much of Mexico.His hope was to make it to the U.S. border and petition for asylum. He was undeterred by Trump's recent efforts to restrict asylum claims or curb immigration.""One way or another, I have to make it to the other side where there are skyscrapers and life is better,"" he said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5ol82jExNHqBHa7IGzz2mw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/03f35d3f9d537a8dc9fe503d06c098de,"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation"
Denmark Snubs Trump With Approval of Russian Gas Pipe to Europe,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 14:14:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/denmark-snubs-trump-approval-russian-141104626.html,"(Bloomberg) -- In a major boost for Russia’s effort to tighten its grip over natural gas supplies to western Europe, Denmark said it will allow the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline to pass through its territory.The decision removes the last important hurdle for the $11 billion project, which is slated for commissioning by the end of this year and bolster gas flows from Siberia into Germany. The link has drawn the threat of sanctions from the U.S., which wants Europe to buy its liquefied natural gas. It risks reigniting a feud between Donald Trump and Danish lawmakers that erupted in the summer after the U.S. president’s offer to buy Greenland.Russian President Vladimir Putin welcomed the pipeline decision. “Denmark showed itself to be a responsible participant in international relations, defending its interests and sovereignty and the interests of its main partners in Europe,” he told a briefing in Budapest, where he was on a visit.The green light gives Gazprom PJSC, Russia’s gas export champion and already Europe’s biggest supplier, yet another route to one of the world’s most liquid gas markets. While Trump has accused Russia of using its natural gas as a political weapon, it’s ultimately a commercial deal over which Washington has little influence, according to Raffaello Pantucci, Director of Security Studies at the Royal United Services Institute in London.“It’s frankly too far advanced,” Pantucci said. “Who are they going to sanction?”The approval also gives Russia more clout in ongoing talks with Ukraine on a new gas transit deal, increasing the risk of a disruption from Jan. 1. Uncertainty about whether those two nations can agree on time has been weighing on forward prices in Europe and sending incentives for traders to stockpile gas as a cushion against disruption.“If Gazprom are confident in Nord Stream 2’s imminent completion, it may encourage a tougher negotiating stance on any new Ukrainian transit deal,” said John Twomey, a gas analyst at BloombergNEF in London. “If anything, the risks of a disruption on Jan. 1 have gone up as a result of this.”The pipeline has divided EU governments, with nations led by Poland concerned about the bloc’s increasing dependence on Russian gas.“It is not too late to stop NS2,” an official at the U.S. embassy in Germany said. “There are clear negative energy security and geopolitical implications for Europe from Putin’s pipeline. The U.S. government agrees with the European Parliament, the U.S. House and nearly 20 European countries in our opposition to NS2.”Russia, Ukraine, Europe Pledge New Gas Deal by Year-EndDenmark said on Wednesday it will allow the pipeline to pass southeast of the island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea. The company behind the pipeline submitted the route plan in April. Denmark had been conducting a security and environmental review of the project.Trump had objected to the link, instead urging the European Union to diversify the sources of its energy and dilute Putin’s economic influence over the region. U.S. officials have also warned that project partners are at an elevated risk of U.S. sanctions.The approval is another snub of Trump by the Nordic country after it ruled out his proposal to buy Greenland this summer. The president responded by canceling a state visit to Denmark.The Danish approval covers 147 kilometers (91 miles) of the project. Nord Stream 2 said in its statement that it has already completed 87%, or 2,100 kilometers, of the pipeline in Russian, Finnish and Swedish waters as well as most of the German part. Dan Jorgensen, Denmark’s minister for climate, energy and utilities, declined to comment on Wednesday.Nord Stream 2 said it will continue its “constructive cooperation with the Danish authorities to complete the pipeline.”Six WeeksGazprom CEO Alexey Miller said that the pipeline is expected to be completed on time by the end of the year. “The remaining 147 kilometers -- that’s five weeks of work,” Miller told reporters in Budapest.A statement from the company highlighted some uncertainties in that timetable. Nord Stream 2 said Wednesday the actual start of the construction depends on a number of legal, technical and environmental factors, which will “take a few weeks” and the project aims for completion “in the coming months.”Gazprom can’t use the permit for the next four weeks when all involved parties have leeway to make a complaint under Danish law. Those issues left analysts anticipating some delay beyond Jan. 1 for the completion of the link.“It’s unlikely that Nord Stream 2 is online in time for Jan. 1, so Ukrainian transit disruption risks remains,” said Twomey.While Gazprom owns the pipeline, half the financing of the 8 billion-euro capital cost comes from five European companies: Uniper SE and Wintershall of Germany, OMV AG of Austria, Engie SA of France and Royal Dutch Shell Plc.Dutch gas for the first quarter declined to the lowest since at least 2017 as the region is oversupplied with the fuel, storage sites across Europe are full, and LNG imports surge.(Updates with Putin comment in third paragraph.)\--With assistance from Dina Khrennikova, Vanessa Dezem and Ilya Arkhipov.To contact the reporters on this story: Morten Buttler in Copenhagen at mbuttler@bloomberg.net;William Wilkes in Frankfurt at wwilkes1@bloomberg.net;Anna Shiryaevskaya in London at ashiryaevska@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Christian Wienberg at cwienberg@bloomberg.net, ;Tasneem Hanfi Brögger at tbrogger@bloomberg.net, ;Nick Rigillo at nrigillo@bloomberg.net, Gregory L.

Meghan McCain Spars With Cory Booker Over Civility: Beto Was ‘Very Nasty’ to Me!,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:39:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/meghan-mccain-spars-cory-booker-163901660.html,"During a Wednesday interview with Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, The View’s Meghan McCain did what she apparently does best: Make the conversation about herself and, in this case, her personal beef with a presidential hopeful.After applauding Booker for saying Medicare for All is unrealistic, the conservative View co-host took issue with the New Jersey senator’s support for mandatory gun buybacks. This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he’s going to take her brother’s guns.After a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they’d continue the conversation in the next segment.“No we’re not,” McCain grumbled. “It’s fine.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 10:05:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-warren-untenable-plans-140521979.html,"If you’ve been having trouble finding someone to walk your dog, don’t worry. Any day now, Elizabeth Warren will announce “a plan for that.” It will undoubtedly be comprehensive, detailed, and replete with subsidies for lower- and middle-class dog walkers and underserved breeds. It will cost tens of billions of dollars and will receive widespread positive notice from the media. However, to judge by her other recent plans, the one thing it won’t include is any discussion of how she plans to pay for it.The Massachusetts senator has challenged and possibly overtaken former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, largely based on having a plan for the government to tackle every problem facing this country, no matter how big or how small, from issues with military housing to Puerto Rican debt to climate change.The price tag for this massive expansion of government is enormous. Much of the attention in recent weeks has been focused on Warren’s embrace of Medicare for All, which she refuses to admit would require an increase in middle-class taxes. Even Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has conceded that such proposals, which would cost $30–40 trillion over 10 years, cannot be financed without tax hikes. Warren’s refusal to address this obvious fact makes her look less like a would-be policy wonk and more like a typical politician.But even setting aside Medicare for All, Warren’s plans are likely to dump oceans of red ink onto our growing national debt. Her non-health-care spending proposals already total some $7.5 trillion per year over the next 10 years. Although these are not quite Bernie levels of government largesse, her proposals would still require nearly double our current levels of spending.To pay for all this, Warren proposes a variety of tax hikes, mostly designed to hit corporations or high-earners: higher payroll taxes for those earning more than $250,000 per year; a 7 percent profits tax on companies earning more than $100 million; a 60 percent lobbying tax on firms that spend a million or more on lobbying, and so forth. But the biggest chunk of money would come from Warren’s proposed “wealth tax,” a 2 to 3 percent levy on net worth above $50 million. Warren estimates that this wealth tax will pull in more than $2.75 trillion over ten years. It won’t.First, there is the slight problem that a wealth tax is probably unconstitutional. Of course, constitutional constraints are quaint notions in the Age of Trump. Regardless, it is worth noting that the Constitution permits the federal government to impose only “direct taxes,” such as a property tax. That’s why it required a constitutional amendment to enact the federal income tax. Many constitutional scholars warn that a wealth tax is neither a direct tax nor income tax.Even if Warren can find a way around the constitutional guardrails -- perhaps by something such as a retrospective wealth tax in which you wait until a taxpayer sells assets or passes away -- a wealth tax is unlikely to raise anywhere near the amount of money she predicts.Simply look at Europe’s experiments with wealth taxes. At one time, a dozen European countries imposed wealth taxes. Today, all but three have abandoned those levies. Among those repealing their wealth tax are the Scandinavian social democracies that Warren admires, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Norway retains a wealth tax but has significantly reduced it in recent years. Additional countries abandoning the tax include Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Other countries, such as Great Britain, have considered wealth taxes and rejected them.They did so because wealth taxes are administratively complex and difficult to enforce. Also, they significantly reduce investment, entrepreneurship, and, ultimately, economic growth. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, European wealth taxes raised, on average, only about 0.2 percent of GDP in revenues. By comparison, the U.S. federal income tax raises 8 percent of GDP.Two groups, however, would benefit substantially from a wealth tax. The tax would be a full-employment opportunity for the tax-preparation industry and for lawyers. After all, we would now have to determine fair market value for everything from homes and vehicles to artwork and jewelry to family pension rights and intellectual property. The other big winner would be lobbyists, who could be expected to descend on Washington en masse seeking exemptions and exceptions for their clients. If you think the tax code is a mess today, just wait until D.C. is done with Warren’s plan.There is an old Yiddish proverb that goes “Mann tracht, un Gott Lacht,” or “Man plans, and God laughs.” It is all well and good that Senator Warren has a plan for everything.

Tucker Carlson and Guest Blame Diversity and ‘Woke’ Culture for California Fires,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 07:17:19 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/tucker-carlson-guest-blame-diversity-032855316.html,"Fox NewsFox News host Tucker Carlson and his guest, conservative YouTube personality Dave Rubin, both insisted Tuesday night that the wildfires burning across California are due largely to progressive ideology, “woke” culture, and diversity in hiring.During Tuesday’s broadcast of Tucker Carlson Tonight, Carlson welcomed on Rubin, a political commentator and podcaster, to discuss the issues surrounding the large fires engulfing the state, including those related to the electrical grid and firefighting methods.“PG&E; strikes me as almost a metaphor for the destruction of the state,” Carlson said about the state’s power company. “Here’s the utility which doesn’t really know anything about its own infrastructure but knows everything about the race of its employees. How did we get there?”After noting that he lives near one of the fires in the Los Angeles area, Rubin immediately took aim at liberal politics as the main reason the wildfires have grown so large and dangerous.“The problem right now is that everything, EVERYTHING, from academia to public utilities to politics, everything that goes woke, that buys into this ridiculous progressive ideology that cares about what contractors are LGBT or how many black firemen we have or white this or Asian that, everything that goes that road eventually breaks down,” he declared.As Carlson nodded and said “that’s true,” Rubin continued, complaining that this isn’t how “freedom is supposed to operate.”“What is supposed to happen—imagine if your house was on fire,” he added. “Would you care what the public utility or what the fire company, what contractor they brought in, what gender or sexuality or any of those things he or she was? It’s just absolutely ridiculous.”The Fox News host continued to agree with Rubin, who went on to tie PG&E;’s preemptive blackouts to a lack of “libertarian or conservative-minded people in California to fight what the progressives are doing to the state.”“If you can’t keep the lights on and you can’t keep the place from burning down, you’ve reached the point where there is no kind of lying about it anymore,” Carlson concluded. “It’s falling apart.

"Former &lt;/&gt;Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:11:25 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/former-time-editor-wants-hate-211125098.html,"A former Time editor claimed that the United States needs a law banning hate speech, and that President Donald Trump “might be in violation of it” if there were one -- because, apparently, he doesn’t notice the irony of holding both of these views at once.In a Tuesday tweet promoting his Washington Post piece, titled “Why America needs a hate speech law,” Richard Stengel stated:> My @WashingtonPost piece on why the very broadness of the First Amendment suggests we should have a hate speech law. And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f> > -- Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019In the piece, Stengel writes that “many nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred” in the wake of World War II:> These laws started out as protections against the kinds of anti-Semitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws, but there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general, hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.“I’m all for protecting ‘thought that we hate,’ but not speech that incites hate,” he continues. “It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.”It’s interesting how Stengel actually does acknowledge the fact that “there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is,” and yet he still wants laws banning it. This makes absolutely no sense. After all, when he calls for laws to ban “hate speech,” he is, inherently, giving the government the power to decide what would and would not qualify -- the exact same government that is led by Donald Trump, and that is full of people who support him.In other words: Stengel somehow trusts that the government will have the same view of “hate speech” as he does, and then, in the same thought, seems to acknowledge that there’s actually no way that many of them would. Unless he thinks that the president and his congressional supporters would actually pass a law that they’d be in violation of, his argument for “hate speech” laws winds up being a pretty great argument against them.It’s ironic, but it’s not new: More often than not, it’s the uber-progressives arguing for laws against “hate speech” -- despite the fact that they’re often the same people who are also arguing that Donald Trump and Republicans are constantly spewing it. Maybe it’s just me, but if I thought that the leader of my government was, you know, literally Hitler or whatever, the last thing that I’d want would be to give that person and their supporters control over my speech.Yes, the First Amendment gives us the right to be “offensive” with our speech. Given the fact that a new thing seems to be declared “racist” or “sexist” every day, I’m certainly glad that we do have this protection. After all, it would only take there being a few too many of the “super woke” in our government for a phrase like “you guys” to become a criminal offense.The truth is, though, the right to be “offensive” (however you define that subjective term, anyway) is not even the most important role that our First Amendment plays. No, what’s most important is that it protects our right to speak out against the government when we see fit -- without having to worry about its retaliation. Like it or not, the only way to ensure that we retain this important check on government power is to never (ever) give its leaders a vehicle take it away.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eTNessteMBpuBTcqmJGuYw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/bae9af12e23cce197b317b5c1be56053,"Former </>Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony"

NYC Medical Examiner Dismisses Epstein ‘Homicide’ Claim by Dr. Michael Baden,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 15:28:10 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/nyc-medical-examiner-dismisses-epstein-192810863.html,"Robyn Beck/ReutersNew York City’s chief medical examiner pushed back hard Wednesday against a celebrity pathologist-for-hire’s conspiracy-stirring claim that Jeffrey Epstein’s autopsy was more consistent with homicide than suicide.“The original medical investigation was thorough and complete. There is no reason for a second medical investigation by our office,” said Dr. Barbara Sampson.Sampson determined Epstein died by suicide from hanging in his jail cell in August, while he was awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.Epstein’s lawyers and family have refused to accept her finding, and the disgraced financier’s brother hired Dr. Michael Baden—erstwhile host of HBO’s Autopsy—to do his own investigation.Jeffrey Epstein’s Death Ruled Suicide by Hanging: New York City Medical ExaminerDuring an appearance Wednesday morning on Fox News, where he is a contributor, Baden said his own review isn’t complete but nonetheless suggested that suicide isn’t the cause of death.He claimed a collection of neck fractures in Epstein’s hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage “are extremely unusual in suicidal hangings and could occur much more commonly in homicidal strangulation.”“I’ve not seen in 50 years where that occurred in a suicidal hanging case,” Baden said.Although more common in homicidal strangulation cases, some studies have found that hyoid and thyroid fractures are not rare in suicidal hangings.A 2000 study in Australia found fractures in nearly half the 40 suicide cases it examined and said they were even more common in older victims and men; in fact, 15 percent had fractures of both the hyoid and the thyroid. And a 2010 study out of Thailand found such fractures in 25 percent of the confirmed suicides it reviewed.After His Suicide Watch Ended, Jeffrey Epstein Was Left to Look After HimselfBaden, who observed the autopsy performed by Sampson, served briefly as the city’s chief medical examiner before being fired in 1979 by then-Mayor Ed Koch in response to a complaint that he told doctors during a guest-speaking event that Gov. Nelson Rockefeller had died during sexual intercourse.Three years later, he was dismissed as chief deputy medical examiner by Suffolk County, New York, over a magazine article about ways to kill that wouldn’t show up in an autopsy; he protested that he was misquoted.In the '70s, Baden helped Congress investigate the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.—he concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald and James Earl Ray, respectively, were the killers—but became famous for serving as a private pathologist in high-profile cases like the Aaron Hernandez suicide, the O.J. Simpson murder trial, and the Jayson Williams shooting. He also served as a defense witness in the Phil Spector murder trial, where he reportedly testified that he had no conflict of interest in the case even though his wife was heading Spector’s legal team.Baden isn’t the only one skeptical about the official account of Epstein’s death at the high-security federal lockup in Manhattan, which is currently the subject of a Justice Department probe.Spencer Kuvin, a lawyer representing victims of Epstein, said serious questions remain, including the whereabouts of the guards assigned to monitor him, why the cameras outside his cell apparently didn’t work, and why he was taken off suicide watch.“It all makes no sense. Until they come out with the evidence, I don’t believe anything they’re telling us,” Kuvin said. “Exactly what happened I can’t tell you, but I certainly don’t believe the story they’re trying to feed everyone.”Sigrid McCawley, an attorney at Boies Schiller Flexner, the law firm representing some of Epstein’s victims, said the ongoing Justice Department probe “limits what can and should be said at this time.”“But as the public has come to to understand the horrifying scope and scale of the international sex trafficking system he operated for decades with impunity, what really matters for the brave survivors who are seeking justice is how he lived, not how he died,” she said. “That is how the man should be judged.”Kuvin said his clients are “more interested in seeing co-conspirators prosecuted” than in delving into Epstein autopsy theories.“The justice system failed. They either allowed him to take his own life or someone got in there and killed him,” Kuvin told The Daily Beast. “Either way, it’s a failure of the Justice Department… [which] has failed them repeatedly over the last 13 years. This was just one more time.”If you or a loved one are struggling with suicidal thoughts, please reach out to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), or contact the Crisis Text Line by texting TALK to 741741Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 13:17:36 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/record-wave-lone-child-migrants-122133758.html,"TENOSIQUE, Mexico -- The United States has detained more children trying to cross the nation's southwest border on their own over the last year than during any other period on record, surpassing the surge of unaccompanied minors that set off a crisis during the Obama administration, according to new figures released Tuesday.U.S. immigration authorities apprehended 76,020 minors, most of them from Central America, traveling without their parents in the fiscal year that ended in September -- 52% more than during the last fiscal year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Mexico is experiencing the same surge. Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period -- pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.In interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous -- and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.""These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,"" Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters. ""And each month during the fiscal year, the numbers increased. You saw them. We all saw them.""The young migrants came alongside a historic wave of families traveling together, also largely from Central America. They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.Marvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced -- and he pressed on.""Quitting was not an option,"" Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. ""You wipe your tears and carry on.""For the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they'd kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.His parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said. ""We can't bear losing another son,"" they told him. ""You have to go.""He left home in the spring, with $40 in his pocket and no plan except to find work in a safer place.As for most underage migrants traveling without their parents, his trip north has been a feat of improvisation and courage. He walked and hitchhiked through Honduras and Guatemala. He slept in churches, under trees or wherever he found himself when night fell.Along the way, he gathered crucial bits of information from fellow migrants: the best route to take, locations of shelters up ahead, places to avoid, where to forage for food.As huge numbers of young migrants from Central America began arriving at the United States' southern border in 2014, the Obama administration scrambled to house them until they could be released to sponsors -- adults who applied to care for them. The shelter system grew dramatically as a result.The Trump administration experienced similar backups at the border just a few years later -- this time because of new, more stringent policies that made the sponsors themselves, who are often undocumented, vulnerable to immigration authorities. This discouraged people from coming forward, leaving thousands of children to languish in the system.The Trump administration has also sought to deter migration by separating thousands of children from their relatives, again driving up the number of children in federally contracted shelters.On the road, while trying to avoid detention, fear and hunger are constant companions for many young migrants.With little or no money in their pockets, they relied on strangers for snacks or meals. They pawed through garbage and scanned drifts of debris on the roadside, hoping to spot an edible morsel.Wilson, a 17-year-old Honduran, said he had feasted on rotten mangos discarded by street vendors.""I used to drink water from potholes when I was too thirsty,"" interjected Mario Leonel, 16, who left home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, several weeks ago without notifying his parents. ""That is the hardest part of it all: the hunger.""When he arrived at the shelter in Tenosique, a small Mexican town near the Guatemala border, he called his parents in Honduras, who burst into tears and pleaded for him to return. He said no. He was tired of all the violence in his country, and wanted to get asylum in the United States.After Marvel slipped across the Guatemala-Mexico border in May, he found room at a shelter in Tenosique, which serves as a transit point for many migrants. He quickly made new friends among other teenage migrants who had made it this far, mainly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador.On a recent afternoon, several of them gathered in a two-story building that had been reserved for minors, its walls painted with colorful animal murals. The boys cracked jokes, roughhoused and argued about who was the cutest girl in the shelter.Outside, Dulce, a 16-year-old transgender migrant from Guatemala, sat alone on train tracks pining for a boy she had met at the shelter. He had left without explanation and she was lovesick.""I just can't get him out of my mind,"" she said.She left her hometown four months earlier to escape abuse from her family and strangers, including a sexual assault by gang members when she was 12. She made it as far as central Mexico before being detained and deported. Five days after returning home, she set off again.""I left because I had nothing there and no one to protect me,"" she said. ""At least here I am safe.""Though the United States remains the destination of choice for most unaccompanied minors, an increasing number are setting their sights no farther than Mexico, advocates and migrants say.Sometimes they have no choice: Mexico's increased enforcement measures have made it more difficult for migrants to make it to the border with the United States. And even if they reach the United States, recent policies have drastically lowered the possibilities of getting asylum.In Mexico, when unaccompanied minors are detained, the law mandates that they be released right away into the custody of the national child protection agency, which finds them accommodation in shelters designed for children.But migrants' advocates say the government has been holding children in the nation's overcrowded detention centers for far too long, and that some children are quickly funneled into the deportation process rather than being given a fair chance to seek asylum or some other form of relief.""No child should ever be held at a detention center,"" said Elba Coria, a migration expert from the Clinic for Refugees at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City. ""But while international standards consider children's detention as an exceptional measure, amid Mexico's migration chaos, it is the rule.""Neither Marvel nor any of his new friends in the Tenosique shelter had been detained by the authorities. All had managed to cross into Mexico from Guatemala and had applied for asylum in Mexico after talking through their options with the shelter staff.They now plan to remain in Mexico and look for work and study opportunities -- even if they haven't abandoned hope of making it to the United States.""It is every Honduran's boy dream to get to the United States, where there is more money and kids are able to go to school,"" said Jose Angel, 17. He was born with a disability that left him unable to use his arms and left his hometown because his grandmother could no longer take care of him.He was hopeful he could apply for asylum in the United States despite Trump's many efforts to severely lower the number of people granted asylum. ""It is scary, but you have to take a chance,"" he said.On a recent morning, Alan, a 17-year-old Guatemalan migrant, sat on the sidewalk outside a migrant shelter in the city of Palenque, in southern Mexico. He had just crossed the border and was exhausted. Mexican immigration officials had stopped a bus he was on, but he managed to escape into the countryside and hide.Alan planned to take a nap, shower and have a meal before trying illegally to board a freight train known as The Beast. It runs from Mexico's border with Guatemala to its border with the United States and, for decades, migrants have clung to it to speed through much of Mexico.His hope was to make it to the U.S. border and petition for asylum. He was undeterred by Trump's recent efforts to restrict asylum claims or curb immigration.""One way or another, I have to make it to the other side where there are skyscrapers and life is better,"" he said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5ol82jExNHqBHa7IGzz2mw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/03f35d3f9d537a8dc9fe503d06c098de,"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation"
Denmark Snubs Trump With Approval of Russian Gas Pipe to Europe,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 14:14:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/denmark-snubs-trump-approval-russian-141104626.html,"(Bloomberg) -- In a major boost for Russia’s effort to tighten its grip over natural gas supplies to western Europe, Denmark said it will allow the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline to pass through its territory.The decision removes the last important hurdle for the $11 billion project, which is slated for commissioning by the end of this year and bolster gas flows from Siberia into Germany. The link has drawn the threat of sanctions from the U.S., which wants Europe to buy its liquefied natural gas. It risks reigniting a feud between Donald Trump and Danish lawmakers that erupted in the summer after the U.S. president’s offer to buy Greenland.Russian President Vladimir Putin welcomed the pipeline decision. “Denmark showed itself to be a responsible participant in international relations, defending its interests and sovereignty and the interests of its main partners in Europe,” he told a briefing in Budapest, where he was on a visit.The green light gives Gazprom PJSC, Russia’s gas export champion and already Europe’s biggest supplier, yet another route to one of the world’s most liquid gas markets. While Trump has accused Russia of using its natural gas as a political weapon, it’s ultimately a commercial deal over which Washington has little influence, according to Raffaello Pantucci, Director of Security Studies at the Royal United Services Institute in London.“It’s frankly too far advanced,” Pantucci said. “Who are they going to sanction?”The approval also gives Russia more clout in ongoing talks with Ukraine on a new gas transit deal, increasing the risk of a disruption from Jan. 1. Uncertainty about whether those two nations can agree on time has been weighing on forward prices in Europe and sending incentives for traders to stockpile gas as a cushion against disruption.“If Gazprom are confident in Nord Stream 2’s imminent completion, it may encourage a tougher negotiating stance on any new Ukrainian transit deal,” said John Twomey, a gas analyst at BloombergNEF in London. “If anything, the risks of a disruption on Jan. 1 have gone up as a result of this.”The pipeline has divided EU governments, with nations led by Poland concerned about the bloc’s increasing dependence on Russian gas.“It is not too late to stop NS2,” an official at the U.S. embassy in Germany said. “There are clear negative energy security and geopolitical implications for Europe from Putin’s pipeline. The U.S. government agrees with the European Parliament, the U.S. House and nearly 20 European countries in our opposition to NS2.”Russia, Ukraine, Europe Pledge New Gas Deal by Year-EndDenmark said on Wednesday it will allow the pipeline to pass southeast of the island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea. The company behind the pipeline submitted the route plan in April. Denmark had been conducting a security and environmental review of the project.Trump had objected to the link, instead urging the European Union to diversify the sources of its energy and dilute Putin’s economic influence over the region. U.S. officials have also warned that project partners are at an elevated risk of U.S. sanctions.The approval is another snub of Trump by the Nordic country after it ruled out his proposal to buy Greenland this summer. The president responded by canceling a state visit to Denmark.The Danish approval covers 147 kilometers (91 miles) of the project. Nord Stream 2 said in its statement that it has already completed 87%, or 2,100 kilometers, of the pipeline in Russian, Finnish and Swedish waters as well as most of the German part. Dan Jorgensen, Denmark’s minister for climate, energy and utilities, declined to comment on Wednesday.Nord Stream 2 said it will continue its “constructive cooperation with the Danish authorities to complete the pipeline.”Six WeeksGazprom CEO Alexey Miller said that the pipeline is expected to be completed on time by the end of the year. “The remaining 147 kilometers -- that’s five weeks of work,” Miller told reporters in Budapest.A statement from the company highlighted some uncertainties in that timetable. Nord Stream 2 said Wednesday the actual start of the construction depends on a number of legal, technical and environmental factors, which will “take a few weeks” and the project aims for completion “in the coming months.”Gazprom can’t use the permit for the next four weeks when all involved parties have leeway to make a complaint under Danish law. Those issues left analysts anticipating some delay beyond Jan. 1 for the completion of the link.“It’s unlikely that Nord Stream 2 is online in time for Jan. 1, so Ukrainian transit disruption risks remains,” said Twomey.While Gazprom owns the pipeline, half the financing of the 8 billion-euro capital cost comes from five European companies: Uniper SE and Wintershall of Germany, OMV AG of Austria, Engie SA of France and Royal Dutch Shell Plc.Dutch gas for the first quarter declined to the lowest since at least 2017 as the region is oversupplied with the fuel, storage sites across Europe are full, and LNG imports surge.(Updates with Putin comment in third paragraph.)\--With assistance from Dina Khrennikova, Vanessa Dezem and Ilya Arkhipov.To contact the reporters on this story: Morten Buttler in Copenhagen at mbuttler@bloomberg.net;William Wilkes in Frankfurt at wwilkes1@bloomberg.net;Anna Shiryaevskaya in London at ashiryaevska@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Christian Wienberg at cwienberg@bloomberg.net, ;Tasneem Hanfi Brögger at tbrogger@bloomberg.net, ;Nick Rigillo at nrigillo@bloomberg.net, Gregory L.

Meghan McCain Spars With Cory Booker Over Civility: Beto Was ‘Very Nasty’ to Me!,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:39:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/meghan-mccain-spars-cory-booker-163901660.html,"During a Wednesday interview with Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, The View’s Meghan McCain did what she apparently does best: Make the conversation about herself and, in this case, her personal beef with a presidential hopeful.After applauding Booker for saying Medicare for All is unrealistic, the conservative View co-host took issue with the New Jersey senator’s support for mandatory gun buybacks. This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he’s going to take her brother’s guns.After a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they’d continue the conversation in the next segment.“No we’re not,” McCain grumbled. “It’s fine.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 10:05:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-warren-untenable-plans-140521979.html,"If you’ve been having trouble finding someone to walk your dog, don’t worry. Any day now, Elizabeth Warren will announce “a plan for that.” It will undoubtedly be comprehensive, detailed, and replete with subsidies for lower- and middle-class dog walkers and underserved breeds. It will cost tens of billions of dollars and will receive widespread positive notice from the media. However, to judge by her other recent plans, the one thing it won’t include is any discussion of how she plans to pay for it.The Massachusetts senator has challenged and possibly overtaken former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, largely based on having a plan for the government to tackle every problem facing this country, no matter how big or how small, from issues with military housing to Puerto Rican debt to climate change.The price tag for this massive expansion of government is enormous. Much of the attention in recent weeks has been focused on Warren’s embrace of Medicare for All, which she refuses to admit would require an increase in middle-class taxes. Even Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has conceded that such proposals, which would cost $30–40 trillion over 10 years, cannot be financed without tax hikes. Warren’s refusal to address this obvious fact makes her look less like a would-be policy wonk and more like a typical politician.But even setting aside Medicare for All, Warren’s plans are likely to dump oceans of red ink onto our growing national debt. Her non-health-care spending proposals already total some $7.5 trillion per year over the next 10 years. Although these are not quite Bernie levels of government largesse, her proposals would still require nearly double our current levels of spending.To pay for all this, Warren proposes a variety of tax hikes, mostly designed to hit corporations or high-earners: higher payroll taxes for those earning more than $250,000 per year; a 7 percent profits tax on companies earning more than $100 million; a 60 percent lobbying tax on firms that spend a million or more on lobbying, and so forth. But the biggest chunk of money would come from Warren’s proposed “wealth tax,” a 2 to 3 percent levy on net worth above $50 million. Warren estimates that this wealth tax will pull in more than $2.75 trillion over ten years. It won’t.First, there is the slight problem that a wealth tax is probably unconstitutional. Of course, constitutional constraints are quaint notions in the Age of Trump. Regardless, it is worth noting that the Constitution permits the federal government to impose only “direct taxes,” such as a property tax. That’s why it required a constitutional amendment to enact the federal income tax. Many constitutional scholars warn that a wealth tax is neither a direct tax nor income tax.Even if Warren can find a way around the constitutional guardrails -- perhaps by something such as a retrospective wealth tax in which you wait until a taxpayer sells assets or passes away -- a wealth tax is unlikely to raise anywhere near the amount of money she predicts.Simply look at Europe’s experiments with wealth taxes. At one time, a dozen European countries imposed wealth taxes. Today, all but three have abandoned those levies. Among those repealing their wealth tax are the Scandinavian social democracies that Warren admires, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Norway retains a wealth tax but has significantly reduced it in recent years. Additional countries abandoning the tax include Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Other countries, such as Great Britain, have considered wealth taxes and rejected them.They did so because wealth taxes are administratively complex and difficult to enforce. Also, they significantly reduce investment, entrepreneurship, and, ultimately, economic growth. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, European wealth taxes raised, on average, only about 0.2 percent of GDP in revenues. By comparison, the U.S. federal income tax raises 8 percent of GDP.Two groups, however, would benefit substantially from a wealth tax. The tax would be a full-employment opportunity for the tax-preparation industry and for lawyers. After all, we would now have to determine fair market value for everything from homes and vehicles to artwork and jewelry to family pension rights and intellectual property. The other big winner would be lobbyists, who could be expected to descend on Washington en masse seeking exemptions and exceptions for their clients. If you think the tax code is a mess today, just wait until D.C. is done with Warren’s plan.There is an old Yiddish proverb that goes “Mann tracht, un Gott Lacht,” or “Man plans, and God laughs.” It is all well and good that Senator Warren has a plan for everything. But until she actually figures out how to pay for everything without crippling our economy, such plans really don’t add up.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/t_XOfhQ2Q8pn0Eihbaza4g--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/710b4188b8e44ebd02c332c03dfb8d66,Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans

Tucker Carlson and Guest Blame Diversity and ‘Woke’ Culture for California Fires,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 07:17:19 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/tucker-carlson-guest-blame-diversity-032855316.html,"Fox NewsFox News host Tucker Carlson and his guest, conservative YouTube personality Dave Rubin, both insisted Tuesday night that the wildfires burning across California are due largely to progressive ideology, “woke” culture, and diversity in hiring.During Tuesday’s broadcast of Tucker Carlson Tonight, Carlson welcomed on Rubin, a political commentator and podcaster, to discuss the issues surrounding the large fires engulfing the state, including those related to the electrical grid and firefighting methods.“PG&E; strikes me as almost a metaphor for the destruction of the state,” Carlson said about the state’s power company. “Here’s the utility which doesn’t really know anything about its own infrastructure but knows everything about the race of its employees. How did we get there?”After noting that he lives near one of the fires in the Los Angeles area, Rubin immediately took aim at liberal politics as the main reason the wildfires have grown so large and dangerous.“The problem right now is that everything, EVERYTHING, from academia to public utilities to politics, everything that goes woke, that buys into this ridiculous progressive ideology that cares about what contractors are LGBT or how many black firemen we have or white this or Asian that, everything that goes that road eventually breaks down,” he declared.As Carlson nodded and said “that’s true,” Rubin continued, complaining that this isn’t how “freedom is supposed to operate.”“What is supposed to happen—imagine if your house was on fire,” he added. “Would you care what the public utility or what the fire company, what contractor they brought in, what gender or sexuality or any of those things he or she was? It’s just absolutely ridiculous.”The Fox News host continued to agree with Rubin, who went on to tie PG&E;’s preemptive blackouts to a lack of “libertarian or conservative-minded people in California to fight what the progressives are doing to the state.”“If you can’t keep the lights on and you can’t keep the place from burning down, you’ve reached the point where there is no kind of lying about it anymore,” Carlson concluded. “It’s falling apart.

"Former &lt;/&gt;Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:11:25 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/former-time-editor-wants-hate-211125098.html,"A former Time editor claimed that the United States needs a law banning hate speech, and that President Donald Trump “might be in violation of it” if there were one -- because, apparently, he doesn’t notice the irony of holding both of these views at once.In a Tuesday tweet promoting his Washington Post piece, titled “Why America needs a hate speech law,” Richard Stengel stated:> My @WashingtonPost piece on why the very broadness of the First Amendment suggests we should have a hate speech law. And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f> > -- Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019In the piece, Stengel writes that “many nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred” in the wake of World War II:> These laws started out as protections against the kinds of anti-Semitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws, but there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general, hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.“I’m all for protecting ‘thought that we hate,’ but not speech that incites hate,” he continues. “It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.”It’s interesting how Stengel actually does acknowledge the fact that “there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is,” and yet he still wants laws banning it. This makes absolutely no sense. After all, when he calls for laws to ban “hate speech,” he is, inherently, giving the government the power to decide what would and would not qualify -- the exact same government that is led by Donald Trump, and that is full of people who support him.In other words: Stengel somehow trusts that the government will have the same view of “hate speech” as he does, and then, in the same thought, seems to acknowledge that there’s actually no way that many of them would. Unless he thinks that the president and his congressional supporters would actually pass a law that they’d be in violation of, his argument for “hate speech” laws winds up being a pretty great argument against them.It’s ironic, but it’s not new: More often than not, it’s the uber-progressives arguing for laws against “hate speech” -- despite the fact that they’re often the same people who are also arguing that Donald Trump and Republicans are constantly spewing it. Maybe it’s just me, but if I thought that the leader of my government was, you know, literally Hitler or whatever, the last thing that I’d want would be to give that person and their supporters control over my speech.Yes, the First Amendment gives us the right to be “offensive” with our speech. Given the fact that a new thing seems to be declared “racist” or “sexist” every day, I’m certainly glad that we do have this protection. After all, it would only take there being a few too many of the “super woke” in our government for a phrase like “you guys” to become a criminal offense.The truth is, though, the right to be “offensive” (however you define that subjective term, anyway) is not even the most important role that our First Amendment plays. No, what’s most important is that it protects our right to speak out against the government when we see fit -- without having to worry about its retaliation. Like it or not, the only way to ensure that we retain this important check on government power is to never (ever) give its leaders a vehicle take it away.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eTNessteMBpuBTcqmJGuYw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/bae9af12e23cce197b317b5c1be56053,"Former </>Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony"

NYC Medical Examiner Dismisses Epstein ‘Homicide’ Claim by Dr. Michael Baden,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 15:28:10 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/nyc-medical-examiner-dismisses-epstein-192810863.html,"Robyn Beck/ReutersNew York City’s chief medical examiner pushed back hard Wednesday against a celebrity pathologist-for-hire’s conspiracy-stirring claim that Jeffrey Epstein’s autopsy was more consistent with homicide than suicide.“The original medical investigation was thorough and complete. There is no reason for a second medical investigation by our office,” said Dr. Barbara Sampson.Sampson determined Epstein died by suicide from hanging in his jail cell in August, while he was awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.Epstein’s lawyers and family have refused to accept her finding, and the disgraced financier’s brother hired Dr. Michael Baden—erstwhile host of HBO’s Autopsy—to do his own investigation.Jeffrey Epstein’s Death Ruled Suicide by Hanging: New York City Medical ExaminerDuring an appearance Wednesday morning on Fox News, where he is a contributor, Baden said his own review isn’t complete but nonetheless suggested that suicide isn’t the cause of death.He claimed a collection of neck fractures in Epstein’s hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage “are extremely unusual in suicidal hangings and could occur much more commonly in homicidal strangulation.”“I’ve not seen in 50 years where that occurred in a suicidal hanging case,” Baden said.Although more common in homicidal strangulation cases, some studies have found that hyoid and thyroid fractures are not rare in suicidal hangings.A 2000 study in Australia found fractures in nearly half the 40 suicide cases it examined and said they were even more common in older victims and men; in fact, 15 percent had fractures of both the hyoid and the thyroid. And a 2010 study out of Thailand found such fractures in 25 percent of the confirmed suicides it reviewed.After His Suicide Watch Ended, Jeffrey Epstein Was Left to Look After HimselfBaden, who observed the autopsy performed by Sampson, served briefly as the city’s chief medical examiner before being fired in 1979 by then-Mayor Ed Koch in response to a complaint that he told doctors during a guest-speaking event that Gov. Nelson Rockefeller had died during sexual intercourse.Three years later, he was dismissed as chief deputy medical examiner by Suffolk County, New York, over a magazine article about ways to kill that wouldn’t show up in an autopsy; he protested that he was misquoted.In the '70s, Baden helped Congress investigate the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.—he concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald and James Earl Ray, respectively, were the killers—but became famous for serving as a private pathologist in high-profile cases like the Aaron Hernandez suicide, the O.J. Simpson murder trial, and the Jayson Williams shooting. He also served as a defense witness in the Phil Spector murder trial, where he reportedly testified that he had no conflict of interest in the case even though his wife was heading Spector’s legal team.Baden isn’t the only one skeptical about the official account of Epstein’s death at the high-security federal lockup in Manhattan, which is currently the subject of a Justice Department probe.Spencer Kuvin, a lawyer representing victims of Epstein, said serious questions remain, including the whereabouts of the guards assigned to monitor him, why the cameras outside his cell apparently didn’t work, and why he was taken off suicide watch.“It all makes no sense. Until they come out with the evidence, I don’t believe anything they’re telling us,” Kuvin said. “Exactly what happened I can’t tell you, but I certainly don’t believe the story they’re trying to feed everyone.”Sigrid McCawley, an attorney at Boies Schiller Flexner, the law firm representing some of Epstein’s victims, said the ongoing Justice Department probe “limits what can and should be said at this time.”“But as the public has come to to understand the horrifying scope and scale of the international sex trafficking system he operated for decades with impunity, what really matters for the brave survivors who are seeking justice is how he lived, not how he died,” she said. “That is how the man should be judged.”Kuvin said his clients are “more interested in seeing co-conspirators prosecuted” than in delving into Epstein autopsy theories.“The justice system failed. They either allowed him to take his own life or someone got in there and killed him,” Kuvin told The Daily Beast. “Either way, it’s a failure of the Justice Department… [which] has failed them repeatedly over the last 13 years. This was just one more time.”If you or a loved one are struggling with suicidal thoughts, please reach out to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), or contact the Crisis Text Line by texting TALK to 741741Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Under pressure from the Trump administration, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stepped up immigration enforcement and detained about 40,500 underage migrants traveling north without their parents in the same period -- pushing the total number of these children taken into custody in the region to more than 115,000.In interviews, nearly two dozen children who were heading toward the United States said they knew the trip was dangerous -- and that if they were caught they could end up in overcrowded, dirty facilities on both sides of the border, without adequate food, water or health care. But they took their chances anyway, looking to escape dead-end poverty, violence and a lack of opportunities to study or work, despite President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to block immigration through the southwest border.""These are numbers that no immigration system in the world can handle, not even in this country,"" Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told reporters.

They travel by foot, hitch rides or climb onto trains, carrying only what they can fit in tattered backpacks, and face a staggering array of threats, from thieves and rapists to hunger, loneliness and death.Marvel, a 16-year-old Honduran boy, said he had been on the road for weeks when, somewhere in Guatemala, he came upon a cluster of roadside graves: the final resting place of other migrants who had died on their journey north. He was alone and far from home. Fear crawled up his spine. But he thought of the gang threats he faced -- and he pressed on.""Quitting was not an option,"" Marvel said, giving only his first name for fear of gang retribution. ""You wipe your tears and carry on.""For the young migrants, the risks at home outweigh the potential dangers of the road. Most are teenage boys, though girls and children also attempt the trip. For Marvel, the decision to leave came when a gang in his hometown, Olancho, told him that if he did not join their ranks, they'd kill him and his family. There was no doubt they were serious, Marvel said. Gang members had already murdered his older brother.His parents encouraged him to leave, Marvel said. ""We can't bear losing another son,"" they told him. ""You have to go.""He left home in the spring, with $40 in his pocket and no plan except to find work in a safer place.As for most underage migrants traveling without their parents, his trip north has been a feat of improvisation and courage. He walked and hitchhiked through Honduras and Guatemala. He slept in churches, under trees or wherever he found himself when night fell.Along the way, he gathered crucial bits of information from fellow migrants: the best route to take, locations of shelters up ahead, places to avoid, where to forage for food.As huge numbers of young migrants from Central America began arriving at the United States' southern border in 2014, the Obama administration scrambled to house them until they could be released to sponsors -- adults who applied to care for them. The shelter system grew dramatically as a result.The Trump administration experienced similar backups at the border just a few years later -- this time because of new, more stringent policies that made the sponsors themselves, who are often undocumented, vulnerable to immigration authorities. This discouraged people from coming forward, leaving thousands of children to languish in the system.The Trump administration has also sought to deter migration by separating thousands of children from their relatives, again driving up the number of children in federally contracted shelters.On the road, while trying to avoid detention, fear and hunger are constant companions for many young migrants.With little or no money in their pockets, they relied on strangers for snacks or meals. They pawed through garbage and scanned drifts of debris on the roadside, hoping to spot an edible morsel.Wilson, a 17-year-old Honduran, said he had feasted on rotten mangos discarded by street vendors.""I used to drink water from potholes when I was too thirsty,"" interjected Mario Leonel, 16, who left home in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, several weeks ago without notifying his parents. ""That is the hardest part of it all: the hunger.""When he arrived at the shelter in Tenosique, a small Mexican town near the Guatemala border, he called his parents in Honduras, who burst into tears and pleaded for him to return. He said no. He was tired of all the violence in his country, and wanted to get asylum in the United States.After Marvel slipped across the Guatemala-Mexico border in May, he found room at a shelter in Tenosique, which serves as a transit point for many migrants. He quickly made new friends among other teenage migrants who had made it this far, mainly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador.On a recent afternoon, several of them gathered in a two-story building that had been reserved for minors, its walls painted with colorful animal murals. The boys cracked jokes, roughhoused and argued about who was the cutest girl in the shelter.Outside, Dulce, a 16-year-old transgender migrant from Guatemala, sat alone on train tracks pining for a boy she had met at the shelter. He had left without explanation and she was lovesick.""I just can't get him out of my mind,"" she said.She left her hometown four months earlier to escape abuse from her family and strangers, including a sexual assault by gang members when she was 12. She made it as far as central Mexico before being detained and deported. Five days after returning home, she set off again.""I left because I had nothing there and no one to protect me,"" she said. ""At least here I am safe.""Though the United States remains the destination of choice for most unaccompanied minors, an increasing number are setting their sights no farther than Mexico, advocates and migrants say.Sometimes they have no choice: Mexico's increased enforcement measures have made it more difficult for migrants to make it to the border with the United States. And even if they reach the United States, recent policies have drastically lowered the possibilities of getting asylum.In Mexico, when unaccompanied minors are detained, the law mandates that they be released right away into the custody of the national child protection agency, which finds them accommodation in shelters designed for children.But migrants' advocates say the government has been holding children in the nation's overcrowded detention centers for far too long, and that some children are quickly funneled into the deportation process rather than being given a fair chance to seek asylum or some other form of relief.""No child should ever be held at a detention center,"" said Elba Coria, a migration expert from the Clinic for Refugees at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City. ""But while international standards consider children's detention as an exceptional measure, amid Mexico's migration chaos, it is the rule.""Neither Marvel nor any of his new friends in the Tenosique shelter had been detained by the authorities. All had managed to cross into Mexico from Guatemala and had applied for asylum in Mexico after talking through their options with the shelter staff.They now plan to remain in Mexico and look for work and study opportunities -- even if they haven't abandoned hope of making it to the United States.""It is every Honduran's boy dream to get to the United States, where there is more money and kids are able to go to school,"" said Jose Angel, 17. He was born with a disability that left him unable to use his arms and left his hometown because his grandmother could no longer take care of him.He was hopeful he could apply for asylum in the United States despite Trump's many efforts to severely lower the number of people granted asylum. ""It is scary, but you have to take a chance,"" he said.On a recent morning, Alan, a 17-year-old Guatemalan migrant, sat on the sidewalk outside a migrant shelter in the city of Palenque, in southern Mexico. He had just crossed the border and was exhausted. Mexican immigration officials had stopped a bus he was on, but he managed to escape into the countryside and hide.Alan planned to take a nap, shower and have a meal before trying illegally to board a freight train known as The Beast. It runs from Mexico's border with Guatemala to its border with the United States and, for decades, migrants have clung to it to speed through much of Mexico.His hope was to make it to the U.S. border and petition for asylum. He was undeterred by Trump's recent efforts to restrict asylum claims or curb immigration.""One way or another, I have to make it to the other side where there are skyscrapers and life is better,"" he said.This article originally appeared in The New York Times.(C) 2019 The New York Times Company",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5ol82jExNHqBHa7IGzz2mw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/03f35d3f9d537a8dc9fe503d06c098de,"A Record Wave of Lone Child Migrants, Born of Desperation"
Denmark Snubs Trump With Approval of Russian Gas Pipe to Europe,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 14:14:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/denmark-snubs-trump-approval-russian-141104626.html,"(Bloomberg) -- In a major boost for Russia’s effort to tighten its grip over natural gas supplies to western Europe, Denmark said it will allow the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline to pass through its territory.The decision removes the last important hurdle for the $11 billion project, which is slated for commissioning by the end of this year and bolster gas flows from Siberia into Germany. The link has drawn the threat of sanctions from the U.S., which wants Europe to buy its liquefied natural gas. It risks reigniting a feud between Donald Trump and Danish lawmakers that erupted in the summer after the U.S. president’s offer to buy Greenland.Russian President Vladimir Putin welcomed the pipeline decision. “Denmark showed itself to be a responsible participant in international relations, defending its interests and sovereignty and the interests of its main partners in Europe,” he told a briefing in Budapest, where he was on a visit.The green light gives Gazprom PJSC, Russia’s gas export champion and already Europe’s biggest supplier, yet another route to one of the world’s most liquid gas markets. While Trump has accused Russia of using its natural gas as a political weapon, it’s ultimately a commercial deal over which Washington has little influence, according to Raffaello Pantucci, Director of Security Studies at the Royal United Services Institute in London.“It’s frankly too far advanced,” Pantucci said. “Who are they going to sanction?”The approval also gives Russia more clout in ongoing talks with Ukraine on a new gas transit deal, increasing the risk of a disruption from Jan. 1. Uncertainty about whether those two nations can agree on time has been weighing on forward prices in Europe and sending incentives for traders to stockpile gas as a cushion against disruption.“If Gazprom are confident in Nord Stream 2’s imminent completion, it may encourage a tougher negotiating stance on any new Ukrainian transit deal,” said John Twomey, a gas analyst at BloombergNEF in London. “If anything, the risks of a disruption on Jan. 1 have gone up as a result of this.”The pipeline has divided EU governments, with nations led by Poland concerned about the bloc’s increasing dependence on Russian gas.“It is not too late to stop NS2,” an official at the U.S. embassy in Germany said. “There are clear negative energy security and geopolitical implications for Europe from Putin’s pipeline. The U.S. government agrees with the European Parliament, the U.S. House and nearly 20 European countries in our opposition to NS2.”Russia, Ukraine, Europe Pledge New Gas Deal by Year-EndDenmark said on Wednesday it will allow the pipeline to pass southeast of the island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea. The company behind the pipeline submitted the route plan in April. Denmark had been conducting a security and environmental review of the project.Trump had objected to the link, instead urging the European Union to diversify the sources of its energy and dilute Putin’s economic influence over the region. U.S. officials have also warned that project partners are at an elevated risk of U.S. sanctions.The approval is another snub of Trump by the Nordic country after it ruled out his proposal to buy Greenland this summer. The president responded by canceling a state visit to Denmark.The Danish approval covers 147 kilometers (91 miles) of the project. Nord Stream 2 said in its statement that it has already completed 87%, or 2,100 kilometers, of the pipeline in Russian, Finnish and Swedish waters as well as most of the German part. Dan Jorgensen, Denmark’s minister for climate, energy and utilities, declined to comment on Wednesday.Nord Stream 2 said it will continue its “constructive cooperation with the Danish authorities to complete the pipeline.”Six WeeksGazprom CEO Alexey Miller said that the pipeline is expected to be completed on time by the end of the year. “The remaining 147 kilometers -- that’s five weeks of work,” Miller told reporters in Budapest.A statement from the company highlighted some uncertainties in that timetable. Nord Stream 2 said Wednesday the actual start of the construction depends on a number of legal, technical and environmental factors, which will “take a few weeks” and the project aims for completion “in the coming months.”Gazprom can’t use the permit for the next four weeks when all involved parties have leeway to make a complaint under Danish law. Those issues left analysts anticipating some delay beyond Jan. 1 for the completion of the link.“It’s unlikely that Nord Stream 2 is online in time for Jan. 1, so Ukrainian transit disruption risks remains,” said Twomey.While Gazprom owns the pipeline, half the financing of the 8 billion-euro capital cost comes from five European companies: Uniper SE and Wintershall of Germany, OMV AG of Austria, Engie SA of France and Royal Dutch Shell Plc.Dutch gas for the first quarter declined to the lowest since at least 2017 as the region is oversupplied with the fuel, storage sites across Europe are full, and LNG imports surge.(Updates with Putin comment in third paragraph.)\--With assistance from Dina Khrennikova, Vanessa Dezem and Ilya Arkhipov.To contact the reporters on this story: Morten Buttler in Copenhagen at mbuttler@bloomberg.net;William Wilkes in Frankfurt at wwilkes1@bloomberg.net;Anna Shiryaevskaya in London at ashiryaevska@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Christian Wienberg at cwienberg@bloomberg.net, ;Tasneem Hanfi Brögger at tbrogger@bloomberg.net, ;Nick Rigillo at nrigillo@bloomberg.net, Gregory L.

Meghan McCain Spars With Cory Booker Over Civility: Beto Was ‘Very Nasty’ to Me!,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 12:39:01 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/meghan-mccain-spars-cory-booker-163901660.html,"During a Wednesday interview with Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker, The View’s Meghan McCain did what she apparently does best: Make the conversation about herself and, in this case, her personal beef with a presidential hopeful.After applauding Booker for saying Medicare for All is unrealistic, the conservative View co-host took issue with the New Jersey senator’s support for mandatory gun buybacks. This then prompted McCain to lump Booker in with former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who has made buybacks a central focus of his campaign.“When I heard you and Beto say that, to me, that’s like a left-wing fever dream,” McCain said. “And I want to know how you think you and Beto are going to go to red states and go to my brother’s house and get his AR-15s because, let me tell you, he’s not giving it back.”Booker, meanwhile, asserted he is not nearly where O’Rourke is when it comes to gun buybacks, causing McCain to reply, “Good! Because he’s crazy!”“We should watch the way we talk about each other,” Booker shot back. “Seriously, we can’t tear the character of people down. We have different beliefs.”McCain, however, invoked her ongoing feud with the one-time Texas Senate candidate, complaining that O’Rourke “has no problem doing it to me.”“He was very nasty to me about this,” the ex-Fox News star lamented.Last month, reacting to McCain’s overt warning that gun buybacks would lead to “a lot of violence” from gun owners, O’Rourke said “that kind of language and rhetoric is not helpful” and it could become “self-fulfilling” and give permission to violence.“You and I both know that just because somebody does something to us, doesn’t mean we show the same thing back to them,” Booker responded to McCain, garnering audience applause.“I’m not running for president, with all due respect,” McCain snapped back. “And the way he talks about me inciting violence on this, I take very seriously and I speak for a lot of red state Americans whether he likes it or you like it or not, there’s a lot of Republicans you have to win over.”The New Jersey lawmaker reacted by telling McCain that her voice was one he respected before noting that “what we say about other people says more about us than it does about them.”Booker would then go on to relay an anecdote from the campaign trail in which he defused a voter’s call for violence against President Donald Trump. McCain, meanwhile, brushed it aside and went back to pressing Booker on his buyback proposal and how he’s going to take her brother’s guns.After a bit more back-and-forth over Booker's gun proposals, host Whoopi Goldberg jumped in to send the show to a commercial break, promising the pair that they’d continue the conversation in the next segment.“No we’re not,” McCain grumbled. “It’s fine.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 10:05:21 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-warren-untenable-plans-140521979.html,"If you’ve been having trouble finding someone to walk your dog, don’t worry. Any day now, Elizabeth Warren will announce “a plan for that.” It will undoubtedly be comprehensive, detailed, and replete with subsidies for lower- and middle-class dog walkers and underserved breeds. It will cost tens of billions of dollars and will receive widespread positive notice from the media. However, to judge by her other recent plans, the one thing it won’t include is any discussion of how she plans to pay for it.The Massachusetts senator has challenged and possibly overtaken former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, largely based on having a plan for the government to tackle every problem facing this country, no matter how big or how small, from issues with military housing to Puerto Rican debt to climate change.The price tag for this massive expansion of government is enormous. Much of the attention in recent weeks has been focused on Warren’s embrace of Medicare for All, which she refuses to admit would require an increase in middle-class taxes. Even Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has conceded that such proposals, which would cost $30–40 trillion over 10 years, cannot be financed without tax hikes. Warren’s refusal to address this obvious fact makes her look less like a would-be policy wonk and more like a typical politician.But even setting aside Medicare for All, Warren’s plans are likely to dump oceans of red ink onto our growing national debt. Her non-health-care spending proposals already total some $7.5 trillion per year over the next 10 years. Although these are not quite Bernie levels of government largesse, her proposals would still require nearly double our current levels of spending.To pay for all this, Warren proposes a variety of tax hikes, mostly designed to hit corporations or high-earners: higher payroll taxes for those earning more than $250,000 per year; a 7 percent profits tax on companies earning more than $100 million; a 60 percent lobbying tax on firms that spend a million or more on lobbying, and so forth. But the biggest chunk of money would come from Warren’s proposed “wealth tax,” a 2 to 3 percent levy on net worth above $50 million. Warren estimates that this wealth tax will pull in more than $2.75 trillion over ten years. It won’t.First, there is the slight problem that a wealth tax is probably unconstitutional. Of course, constitutional constraints are quaint notions in the Age of Trump. Regardless, it is worth noting that the Constitution permits the federal government to impose only “direct taxes,” such as a property tax. That’s why it required a constitutional amendment to enact the federal income tax. Many constitutional scholars warn that a wealth tax is neither a direct tax nor income tax.Even if Warren can find a way around the constitutional guardrails -- perhaps by something such as a retrospective wealth tax in which you wait until a taxpayer sells assets or passes away -- a wealth tax is unlikely to raise anywhere near the amount of money she predicts.Simply look at Europe’s experiments with wealth taxes. At one time, a dozen European countries imposed wealth taxes. Today, all but three have abandoned those levies. Among those repealing their wealth tax are the Scandinavian social democracies that Warren admires, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. Norway retains a wealth tax but has significantly reduced it in recent years. Additional countries abandoning the tax include Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Other countries, such as Great Britain, have considered wealth taxes and rejected them.They did so because wealth taxes are administratively complex and difficult to enforce. Also, they significantly reduce investment, entrepreneurship, and, ultimately, economic growth. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, European wealth taxes raised, on average, only about 0.2 percent of GDP in revenues. By comparison, the U.S. federal income tax raises 8 percent of GDP.Two groups, however, would benefit substantially from a wealth tax. The tax would be a full-employment opportunity for the tax-preparation industry and for lawyers. After all, we would now have to determine fair market value for everything from homes and vehicles to artwork and jewelry to family pension rights and intellectual property. The other big winner would be lobbyists, who could be expected to descend on Washington en masse seeking exemptions and exceptions for their clients. If you think the tax code is a mess today, just wait until D.C. is done with Warren’s plan.There is an old Yiddish proverb that goes “Mann tracht, un Gott Lacht,” or “Man plans, and God laughs.” It is all well and good that Senator Warren has a plan for everything. But until she actually figures out how to pay for everything without crippling our economy, such plans really don’t add up.",http://l2.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/t_XOfhQ2Q8pn0Eihbaza4g--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/710b4188b8e44ebd02c332c03dfb8d66,Elizabeth Warren’s Untenable Plans

Tucker Carlson and Guest Blame Diversity and ‘Woke’ Culture for California Fires,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 07:17:19 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/tucker-carlson-guest-blame-diversity-032855316.html,"Fox NewsFox News host Tucker Carlson and his guest, conservative YouTube personality Dave Rubin, both insisted Tuesday night that the wildfires burning across California are due largely to progressive ideology, “woke” culture, and diversity in hiring.During Tuesday’s broadcast of Tucker Carlson Tonight, Carlson welcomed on Rubin, a political commentator and podcaster, to discuss the issues surrounding the large fires engulfing the state, including those related to the electrical grid and firefighting methods.“PG&E; strikes me as almost a metaphor for the destruction of the state,” Carlson said about the state’s power company. “Here’s the utility which doesn’t really know anything about its own infrastructure but knows everything about the race of its employees. How did we get there?”After noting that he lives near one of the fires in the Los Angeles area, Rubin immediately took aim at liberal politics as the main reason the wildfires have grown so large and dangerous.“The problem right now is that everything, EVERYTHING, from academia to public utilities to politics, everything that goes woke, that buys into this ridiculous progressive ideology that cares about what contractors are LGBT or how many black firemen we have or white this or Asian that, everything that goes that road eventually breaks down,” he declared.As Carlson nodded and said “that’s true,” Rubin continued, complaining that this isn’t how “freedom is supposed to operate.”“What is supposed to happen—imagine if your house was on fire,” he added. “Would you care what the public utility or what the fire company, what contractor they brought in, what gender or sexuality or any of those things he or she was? It’s just absolutely ridiculous.”The Fox News host continued to agree with Rubin, who went on to tie PG&E;’s preemptive blackouts to a lack of “libertarian or conservative-minded people in California to fight what the progressives are doing to the state.”“If you can’t keep the lights on and you can’t keep the place from burning down, you’ve reached the point where there is no kind of lying about it anymore,” Carlson concluded. “It’s falling apart.

She said the project would feature a museum, library, gym, and forum.“Barack and I wouldn’t bring some crap up in our neighborhood,” she reportedly said. She pointed out that she hails from the area by birth and that her husband Barack comes from South Side by choice.During his speech at the forum, Barack Obama said: “We joke about it a little bit, like this is the mothership.”While they hope the center could anchor a potential economic revival in the area, there have been setbacks.Opponents of the project are pursuing a federal court appeal after losing a lawsuit.

"Former &lt;/&gt;Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony","Wed, 30 Oct 2019 17:11:25 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/former-time-editor-wants-hate-211125098.html,"A former Time editor claimed that the United States needs a law banning hate speech, and that President Donald Trump “might be in violation of it” if there were one -- because, apparently, he doesn’t notice the irony of holding both of these views at once.In a Tuesday tweet promoting his Washington Post piece, titled “Why America needs a hate speech law,” Richard Stengel stated:> My @WashingtonPost piece on why the very broadness of the First Amendment suggests we should have a hate speech law. And if we did, why the President might be in violation of it. https://t.co/3ybv3kC69f> > -- Richard Stengel (@stengel) October 29, 2019In the piece, Stengel writes that “many nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred” in the wake of World War II:> These laws started out as protections against the kinds of anti-Semitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws, but there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general, hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race, religion, ethnic origin and sexual orientation.“I’m all for protecting ‘thought that we hate,’ but not speech that incites hate,” he continues. “It undermines the very values of a fair marketplace of ideas that the First Amendment is designed to protect.”It’s interesting how Stengel actually does acknowledge the fact that “there’s no agreed-upon definition of what hate speech actually is,” and yet he still wants laws banning it. This makes absolutely no sense. After all, when he calls for laws to ban “hate speech,” he is, inherently, giving the government the power to decide what would and would not qualify -- the exact same government that is led by Donald Trump, and that is full of people who support him.In other words: Stengel somehow trusts that the government will have the same view of “hate speech” as he does, and then, in the same thought, seems to acknowledge that there’s actually no way that many of them would. Unless he thinks that the president and his congressional supporters would actually pass a law that they’d be in violation of, his argument for “hate speech” laws winds up being a pretty great argument against them.It’s ironic, but it’s not new: More often than not, it’s the uber-progressives arguing for laws against “hate speech” -- despite the fact that they’re often the same people who are also arguing that Donald Trump and Republicans are constantly spewing it. Maybe it’s just me, but if I thought that the leader of my government was, you know, literally Hitler or whatever, the last thing that I’d want would be to give that person and their supporters control over my speech.Yes, the First Amendment gives us the right to be “offensive” with our speech. Given the fact that a new thing seems to be declared “racist” or “sexist” every day, I’m certainly glad that we do have this protection. After all, it would only take there being a few too many of the “super woke” in our government for a phrase like “you guys” to become a criminal offense.The truth is, though, the right to be “offensive” (however you define that subjective term, anyway) is not even the most important role that our First Amendment plays. No, what’s most important is that it protects our right to speak out against the government when we see fit -- without having to worry about its retaliation. Like it or not, the only way to ensure that we retain this important check on government power is to never (ever) give its leaders a vehicle take it away.",http://l1.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eTNessteMBpuBTcqmJGuYw--/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b247aD04Njt3PTEzMDs-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/bae9af12e23cce197b317b5c1be56053,"Former </>Time Editor Wants Hate-Speech Laws, Thinks Trump ‘Might’ Violate Them, and Misses the Irony"

NYC Medical Examiner Dismisses Epstein ‘Homicide’ Claim by Dr. Michael Baden,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 15:28:10 -0400",https://news.yahoo.com/nyc-medical-examiner-dismisses-epstein-192810863.html,"Robyn Beck/ReutersNew York City’s chief medical examiner pushed back hard Wednesday against a celebrity pathologist-for-hire’s conspiracy-stirring claim that Jeffrey Epstein’s autopsy was more consistent with homicide than suicide.“The original medical investigation was thorough and complete. There is no reason for a second medical investigation by our office,” said Dr. Barbara Sampson.Sampson determined Epstein died by suicide from hanging in his jail cell in August, while he was awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.Epstein’s lawyers and family have refused to accept her finding, and the disgraced financier’s brother hired Dr. Michael Baden—erstwhile host of HBO’s Autopsy—to do his own investigation.Jeffrey Epstein’s Death Ruled Suicide by Hanging: New York City Medical ExaminerDuring an appearance Wednesday morning on Fox News, where he is a contributor, Baden said his own review isn’t complete but nonetheless suggested that suicide isn’t the cause of death.He claimed a collection of neck fractures in Epstein’s hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage “are extremely unusual in suicidal hangings and could occur much more commonly in homicidal strangulation.”“I’ve not seen in 50 years where that occurred in a suicidal hanging case,” Baden said.Although more common in homicidal strangulation cases, some studies have found that hyoid and thyroid fractures are not rare in suicidal hangings.A 2000 study in Australia found fractures in nearly half the 40 suicide cases it examined and said they were even more common in older victims and men; in fact, 15 percent had fractures of both the hyoid and the thyroid. And a 2010 study out of Thailand found such fractures in 25 percent of the confirmed suicides it reviewed.After His Suicide Watch Ended, Jeffrey Epstein Was Left to Look After HimselfBaden, who observed the autopsy performed by Sampson, served briefly as the city’s chief medical examiner before being fired in 1979 by then-Mayor Ed Koch in response to a complaint that he told doctors during a guest-speaking event that Gov. Nelson Rockefeller had died during sexual intercourse.Three years later, he was dismissed as chief deputy medical examiner by Suffolk County, New York, over a magazine article about ways to kill that wouldn’t show up in an autopsy; he protested that he was misquoted.In the '70s, Baden helped Congress investigate the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.—he concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald and James Earl Ray, respectively, were the killers—but became famous for serving as a private pathologist in high-profile cases like the Aaron Hernandez suicide, the O.J. Simpson murder trial, and the Jayson Williams shooting. He also served as a defense witness in the Phil Spector murder trial, where he reportedly testified that he had no conflict of interest in the case even though his wife was heading Spector’s legal team.Baden isn’t the only one skeptical about the official account of Epstein’s death at the high-security federal lockup in Manhattan, which is currently the subject of a Justice Department probe.Spencer Kuvin, a lawyer representing victims of Epstein, said serious questions remain, including the whereabouts of the guards assigned to monitor him, why the cameras outside his cell apparently didn’t work, and why he was taken off suicide watch.“It all makes no sense. Until they come out with the evidence, I don’t believe anything they’re telling us,” Kuvin said. “Exactly what happened I can’t tell you, but I certainly don’t believe the story they’re trying to feed everyone.”Sigrid McCawley, an attorney at Boies Schiller Flexner, the law firm representing some of Epstein’s victims, said the ongoing Justice Department probe “limits what can and should be said at this time.”“But as the public has come to to understand the horrifying scope and scale of the international sex trafficking system he operated for decades with impunity, what really matters for the brave survivors who are seeking justice is how he lived, not how he died,” she said. “That is how the man should be judged.”Kuvin said his clients are “more interested in seeing co-conspirators prosecuted” than in delving into Epstein autopsy theories.“The justice system failed. They either allowed him to take his own life or someone got in there and killed him,” Kuvin told The Daily Beast. “Either way, it’s a failure of the Justice Department… [which] has failed them repeatedly over the last 13 years. This was just one more time.”If you or a loved one are struggling with suicidal thoughts, please reach out to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), or contact the Crisis Text Line by texting TALK to 741741Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?
